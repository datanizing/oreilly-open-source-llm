At the outset, I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in conducting its work.@@@I also pay tribute to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for the dynamism with which he led the work of the seventy-sixth session.@@@I further commend Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and wish him every success at this difficult time of multiple and complex crises throughout the world.@@@We reiterate to him Chad’s full friendship and support.@@@The seventy-seventh session, whose theme is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is taking place at a time when humankind is facing a multitude of challenges unprecedented since the creation of our Organization.@@@They are serious, complex and successive challenges to our collective efforts and difficult to address.@@@The current international order, based on the Charter of the United Nations, is being severely tested, for instance, by the geopolitical tensions in several parts of our planet, including those caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine, with its impact on the affected civilian populations and on the entire world at the economic, food security and energy supply levels.@@@One of the difficult experiences we have faced was the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that plunged our lives into a state of great upheaval.@@@Today the world is struggling to recover from the shock of COVID-19.@@@We have lived through that unprecedented challenge, enduring the loss of millions of human lives and its adverse health, social and economic consequences.@@@The recent lull in the situation should not lead us to relax; rather, it should prompt us to further consolidate the multilateral cooperation we witnessed when States and organizations came together and supported each other to overcome the scourge.@@@We hope to see a further consolidation of that multilateral cooperation, particularly in addressing other persistent and recurrent crises and challenges such as wars, terrorism, climate change, health and food crises and poverty.@@@This session is therefore an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our collective commitment to realizing them, in particular through the implementation of the recommendations made in the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1).@@@The time has come to take practical measures to achieve those objectives by correcting the many mistakes that have led to the recurrent problems hindering the work of the international community and preventing the full realization of the promises contained in the Charter.@@@In that regard, the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda initiative, which is an action plan aimed at strengthening and accelerating the implementation of multilateral agreements, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and making a concrete difference in the lives of people, is particularly welcome.@@@It is indeed an important step in the right direction.@@@Chad fully supports the initiative and hopes that it will lead to the promotion, strengthening and prioritization of multiple concrete solutions to the major challenges of our time and have a real impact on the lives of the people, particularly those in poor countries, rather than being a sham of multilateralism that is limited only to lengthy statements that have no real effect.@@@In that regard, it is clear that seven years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and three years since its proclamation here in New York, the results of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals are still far from being achieved, especially for poor countries.@@@As the Secretary-General’s reports on that issue have mentioned, those goals will not be met, and many people will be left behind, if bold action is not taken.@@@Unfortunately, a downward spiral may be set off and cause disappointment in the hearts of millions of people around the world.@@@That is why, in the wake of the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary- General’s Our Common Agenda initiative gives us hope that our legitimate expectations regarding international agreements and programmes, first and foremost the 2030 Agenda, can be realized.@@@All our actions converge towards sustainable development, but development is only possible where there is lasting peace and security.@@@That is why the efforts of our States to achieve those objectives require increased and continuous support.@@@The international commitments made to that effect through the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the New Urban Agenda and all other international agendas must be honoured if we are to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one is left behind and having a planet that is fit to live on and can be passed on safely and proudly to succeeding generations.@@@To that end, in the face of mounting and accumulating challenges, it is crucial to strengthen the existing commitments made by virtue of the indispensable solidarity that binds our States together, especially the rich and the poor, through development assistance, on the one hand, and the implementation of economic and financial empowerment mechanisms, as well as sustainable development policies in favour of the least developed and landlocked developing countries, on the other.@@@Despite geopolitical emergencies and various constraints, any approach or attempt to limit development aid would be counterproductive and could increase crisis situations in the world.@@@Chad therefore calls on donor countries to maintain and increase development assistance through the United Nations, which provides unlimited assistance to hundreds of millions of people around the world whose very survival depends on it.@@@I cannot but also mention the issue of debt, which continues to place an unbearable burden on many developing countries, including Chad.@@@That burden constitutes a real problem, hampering post-COVID-19 recovery, economic recovery and the implementation of sustainable development programmes.@@@Debt relief therefore remains an urgent need to promote economic recovery in low-income countries and reverse the gloomy outlook for the global economy.@@@From that perspective, Chad reiterates its commitment to the various needs and initiatives to cancel or restructure the debt of developing countries.@@@I also want to call for the swift implementation of the facilities granted to my country, Chad, within the framework of the initiatives that various multilateral bodies have taken in order to enable us to respond to the pressing needs of our people, who already face the accumulating challenges of economy, humanitarian emergencies, insecurity caused by terrorist threats, the negative effects of climate change, the food crisis and others.@@@Regarding the political situation in my country, as the General Assembly knows, we have been undergoing a period of political transition since 20 April 2021.@@@I can tell everyone now that the transitional process is progressing satisfactorily.@@@The Transitional Military Council, headed by General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, and the Transitional Government, are committed to ending that process and achieving lasting peace leading to rebuilding the Chadian State awaited by the Chadian people.@@@Our inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, which is now under way, should lead to the holding of democratic, free and transparent elections.@@@The dialogue brings together all the nation’s active forces and ensures the participation of political and military movements, made possible thanks to the Doha agreement signed on 8 August.@@@I take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of Chad to the Government of the State of Qatar, headed by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad A1 Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, who kindly hosted and facilitated the pre-dialogue between the Government of Chad and the political and military groups.@@@The inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, in which all segments of the Chadian society participate — including political parties, civil society, politicians, military staff, professional organizations, women, youth, people with special needs, expatriates, civil and religious leaders, defence and security forces and others — is a historic opportunity for Chadians to decide, in full sovereignty, how to rebuild their country.@@@Participants in the dialogue have discussed all issues related to the future of Chad in complete honesty, freedom and sovereignty.@@@The outcome of the dialogue will be implemented and binding on all.@@@Chad is counting on its partners to support and finance the implementation of the dialogue’s ensuing decisions and recommendations.@@@Of course, some have opted not to take part in that historic dialogue.@@@Endeavours are being undertaken to persuading those brothers and sisters to reconsider their choice and join the dialogue.@@@In terms of security and development, the situation in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region has become extremely worrisome and continues to deteriorate due to many factors, including institutional changes in many countries of the region, the dismantling of military counter-terrorism units, the effects of climate change leading to increased food insecurity due to the lack of an appropriate response, uncontrolled illegal migration and unchecked growth in illicit trafficking.@@@With regard to the security situation, we note the resurgence of terrorist activities in the Sahel, which has been relentless in its spread to neighbouring regions in West Africa, especially Togo, Burkina Faso and Benin, where terrorist attacks have taken place.@@@In the light of the continued deterioration of the situation, Chad has continuously called for a new approach to the situation in the Sahel so as to better adapt our responses.@@@In that regard, Chad welcomes the initiative of the United Nations and the African Union, in partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) to conduct a joint strategic assessment of the situation in the Sahel and the appointment of the former President of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, to head the Independent High-level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, responsible for conducting the assessment.@@@We have no doubt that President Issoufou and his team will carry out an in-depth analysis of the problems plaguing the subregion and propose solutions to help us readapt the response to a multidimensional crisis that, despite the solutions already implemented, continues to deteriorate year after year.@@@It is true that the Sahel does not lack strategies or plans to address the crisis.@@@The States of the Sahel and their bilateral and multilateral partners have implemented measures that have been in place for almost 20 years, with results that have fallen short of our expectations.@@@The strategic assessment will therefore enable us to understand the causes, although we already know that the terrorism which is spilling blood in the Sahel cannot be defeated without the restoration of peace and State authority in Libya.@@@The many initiatives adopted by Member States at the national and subregional levels continue to suffer greatly from the lack of adequate resources for their implementation.@@@The G-5 Sahel Joint Force, for example, is struggling to find sustainable and predictable resources to carry out its activities adequately.@@@That is why Chad once again calls on its partners to support the G-5 Sahel in order to prevent the region from plunging deeper into violence and chaos.@@@I reiterate the call of the G-5 Sahel Heads of State for sustainable and predictable funding from United Nations assessed contributions for the Joint Force.@@@With regard to the internal situation of the G-5 Sahel, it has seen the withdrawal of the sisterly Republic of Mali.@@@We regret that withdrawal, as Mali was a founding member of the organization.@@@Its place will be preserved.@@@We will not be able to defeat terrorism or achieve stability and development in the Sahel unless we all join the struggle and pool our capabilities.@@@We hope that our Malian brothers will reconsider their decision and rejoin our joint organization.@@@The door of the G-5 Sahel remains wide open to them.@@@With regard to the situation in Libya, Chad is concerned about the persistence of the political impasse related to the clashes that took place in Tripoli on 26 and 27 August.@@@Chad once again urges the Libyan political actors to prioritize dialogue in order to end the ongoing crisis and continue implementing the agreed elections agenda.@@@Chad encourages the international community, in particular the United Nations and the African Union, to pursue efforts to bring the positions of the various parties to the conflict closer together and foster political dialogue, as the Libyan crisis will be resolved only through peaceful means and a Libyan-led inclusive political dialogue.@@@The persistence of the conflict in Libya poses a permanent threat to neighbouring countries and the entire Sahel region, for which Chad has paid and continues to pay a heavy price.@@@In that regard, Chad once again reiterates its call on the Security Council and the Secretary-General to implement the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, which represents a lasting solution to the issue of its nationals engaged with the various Libyan military factions.@@@With regard to Cuba, Chad calls for the lifting of the economic and trade embargo imposed by the United States Government on that country, which continues to weigh heavily on the lives of its people.@@@Concerning the reform of the Security Council—the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security — Chad once again urges Member States to move from talk to action on implementing that reform and lifting the historical injustice against the African continent, which excludes it from full and fair participation in that organ.@@@In that regard, Chad will continue to fully support the Common African Position, as set forth in the Sirte Declaration and other relevant conventions.@@@In conclusion, I wish the General Assembly every success in carrying out its tasks.@@@It is a great honour for me to address this seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, where we have once again come together as a community of nations to renew our commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We are meeting at a time when we have just passed through a period of tragedy brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed lives all over the world.@@@We thank God that this period is subsiding.@@@We must praise the countries of the world for uniting to fight the pandemic up to this point, where it is on the verge of being eradicated.@@@The development and supply of COVID-19 vaccines has proved very useful, especially with regard to prevention interventions.@@@We also applaud the United Nations for being instrumental while working under extremely difficult conditions.@@@It remained resolute in assisting countries, and it is safe to say we are where we are today because of its efforts.@@@Despite those challenges, it is encouraging to think that there have been some positives to take away from that experience.@@@In the case of Eswatini, we were compelled to develop testing laboratories and oxygen storage facilities, which are now very helpful in the fight against other health issues.@@@We have witnessed the importance of the availability of oxygen, which has been used in saving the lives of snakebite victims and in other medical emergencies.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the midst of an HIV/AIDS pandemic, which we are still battling, and it affected various programmes that had been put in place.@@@Eswatini has made great strides in the fight against HIV and AIDS.@@@We became a shining example for the continent and the world at large after we attained the 95-95-95 UNAIDS treatment-cascade targets in 2020.@@@We are now focused on ending the AIDS pandemic as a global health threat by 2030.@@@That milestone would never have been possible without the support of the development partners that have been with the country since 1986 when our first AIDS case was announced.@@@It is unfortunate that even after COVID-19, when we were beginning to say that there was hope, we are now confronted with the conflicts that are going on all over the world.@@@Their consequences include, among other things, a loss of life.@@@Those conflicts and tensions have also contributed significantly to the rise in food prices globally.@@@They are not unique to specific areas, as they persist in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.@@@We hope to see an end to those clashes through peaceful settlements, and we must applaud the United Nations for its efforts to prevent them from escalating.@@@Hopefully, there will be long-lasting and fruitful results emerging from the interventions of the United Nations.@@@As we gather here in this Hall, we are all reminded of the main purpose of the Organization’s establishment, which was to reduce the tensions that lead to conflict around the world.@@@We hope the aspirations of our forefathers will guide us in using the Organization to bring us together, so that we can resolve our differences where they exist and find lasting solutions.@@@That will unquestionably be of great help to all humankind.@@@Those problems are a setback to the ongoing efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given the negative impact of COVID-19 and the fact that various conflicts are also taking their own toll on those programmes.@@@During the pandemic we witnessed the collapse of many economies, industry shutdowns and disrupted poverty alleviation projects that could not be implemented properly owing to the pandemic prevention measures.@@@That meant that there was no movement of people or goods.@@@Nevertheless, now that COVID-19 is subsiding, it is high time for all of us to once again renew our focus on the SDGs and implement them, as they will play a crucial role in helping our countries develop.@@@We also note the importance of the role that will have to be played by financial institutions in assisting countries in the recovery process, as most countries suffered a great deal, economically and financially, and are therefore now facing challenges in raising the resources to fund that recovery.@@@We urge our financial institutions to remain open to receiving countries that need support for reviving their developmental programmes and to welcome their requests with sympathy for their plight in the face of the challenges they have encountered in dealing with COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.@@@We do appreciate that in recent days we have seen the multilateral financial organizations become more welcoming to countries in need of budgetary
support.@@@We trust that the world will continue to come together to contribute to resolving those challenges, as countries are dealing with great strains on their resources, which they will feel for some time to come.@@@Our theme for the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@It fits very well with many of the issues we are facing in the world today.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini, like all other Member States, has not been immune to encounters that have heightened the pressure on our already stressed economies.@@@They have derailed us from our pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Aspirations for 2063 — the Africa We Want.@@@The theme should therefore serve to kick-start our economies towards recovery and enable us to create a sustainable future for our people.@@@We in Eswatini are continuing our efforts to attract investment and support small and medium enterprises, as well as to create big industries.@@@In doing so, we are aware of the need for reliable energy sources to help us achieve our investment goals, so that is one of the areas that we are working on developing as a region.@@@We are also focused on remaining highly competitive, which is why we are ranked at the top of the World Bank’s ease of doing business index in Africa when it comes to trading across borders.@@@The Government has also put in place fiscal support measures to ensure that the costs of establishing businesses and their initial operating costs are drastically reduced through a range of options from fiscal to non-fiscal incentives.@@@The creation of special economic zones has put us at an advantage to leverage our export potential through attracting export-oriented manufacturing projects.@@@Eswatini is also well positioned as a launching pad to the African Continental Free Trade Area which seeks to boost intra-Africa trade with a market of 1.2 billion people and a combined gross domestic product of $2.2 trillion.@@@The country is also engaged in creating opportunities for our youth to address the issue of unemployment and poverty.@@@There are opportunities to be explored in areas of information and communications technology, agriculture and the informal sector, to name but a few.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini welcomes the new programme by the United Nations Development Programme to support our youth in Africa who want to engage in entrepreneurship to mitigate the issues of poverty.@@@This is a noble idea, and we are ready to embrace it.@@@Food security and ending hunger remain a priority for the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini.@@@We are deploying a double-pronged strategy to address this challenge by providing social safety nets for the most vulnerable groups.@@@We have increased budget allocations, engaged in emergency food aid distribution, provided cash transfers to the elderly and vulnerable, and supported school feeding programmes and other support services for disadvantaged populations.@@@With regard to growth and development in agriculture, the key projects driven by these public investments include the acceleration of water harvesting and irrigation development, where an average of 1,000 hectares is developed with irrigation every year.@@@We are also creating market-linked growth opportunities in agriculture for small and emerging farmers to produce and generate income to enhance their livelihoods.@@@The negative effects of climate change are compelling the Government to build more dams throughout the Kingdom for irrigation.@@@Other initiatives include the rollout of input subsidies for staple food crops.@@@The combination of these programmes has also increased the production of maize, our staple food, by 30 per cent for the 2021-2022 farming season, only 9 per cent short of our national target.@@@With global stability at stake, Africans have recognized the need to guard against opportunists who seek to take advantage of fragile economies to advance their agendas.@@@Ours is a history littered with problems of the past and ongoing attempts to reinfiltrate our countries through covert and overt means.@@@Eswatini is of the ardent belief that Africa must have permanent representation in the United Nations Security Council, a call made in the Ezulwini Consensus in 2005.@@@Our position emanates from the fact that every democracy has its particularity and that societies are founded according to different cultural norms and values.@@@We will not tire of the consideration and belated adoption of this call by the United Nations to bring in a proper perspective on the African polity.@@@It must be noted that, when the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, no country was spared, which means we all needed to come together to find solutions.@@@Unfortunately, Taiwan was unable to access some of the World Health Organization’s programmes and thereby implement the remedies that required their approval.@@@We continue to appeal for Taiwan to be considered for full participation in United Nations agencies.@@@We are confident that the global village would benefit substantially from Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United Nations system.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini calls upon the United Nations to make the necessary arrangements for Taiwan to significantly participate in relevant United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms.@@@As I conclude, Eswatini remains confident in this global body’s ability to confront and overcome the challenges we face because most of them are human- made.@@@We can achieve this through our full commitment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter.@@@At this time, history is calling on each State Member of the United Nations to intensify its efforts to address our plight if we envisage triumphantly walking the path to 2030.@@@However, and most importantly, we must remain certain about one crucial thing: our success hinges on unity and respect for one another.@@@Those are the key to all outcomes of this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@Despite our diversity, we are one big happy family.@@@We need to give the world and our peoples hope and confidence that the United Nations has the full mandate to play its role in all global issues that affect humankind.@@@May the Almighty God bless us all.@@@On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation during his tenure.@@@I commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the Assembly’s many remarkable achievements under his leadership during these challenging times.@@@I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on his ceaseless and untiring efforts to promote peace, security and development, which are very much in line with his exalted role.@@@The first time I might have been able to address the Assembly was in 1984, when I was the Military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.@@@Some 31 years later, in 2016, I had the great privilege to personally address the Assembly as the democratically elected President of my country (see A/71/PV.4 A).@@@As I approach the end of my second and final four- year term, I am reminded of how much has changed in Nigeria, Africa and the world, and yet how some challenges remain.@@@We are now more severely tested by our enduring and our new global challenges, paramount among which are conflicts that are increasingly being driven by non-State actors, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, terrorism, violent extremism, the malignant use of technology, climate change, irregular migration and disparities in opportunities for improved standards of living.@@@Despite the challenging international environment, the United Nations has proved that it can be strong when the will of its members is harnessed for positive, collective action.@@@The guiding principle of this extraordinary institution is the promotion of peace and security, development and human rights.@@@The latest in a chain of events challenging those principles is the conflict in Ukraine, which has already created strains that may be unprecedented for an entire generation.@@@Such a conflict will have adverse consequences for us all, hindering our capacity to work together to resolve conflicts elsewhere, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.@@@Indeed, the ongoing war in Ukraine is making it more difficult to tackle the perennial issues that feature each year in the deliberations of the Assembly, such as nuclear disarmament, the right of Rohingya refugees to return to their homes in Myanmar, Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for statehood and the reduction of inequalities within and among nations.@@@The danger that the war in Ukraine will escalate further justifies Nigeria’s resolute calls for a nuclear- free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which are also necessary measures for preventing global human disasters.@@@In that regard, we must find a way to reach a rapid consensus on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with related commitments by the nuclear-weapon States.@@@I remain firmly convinced that the challenges that have come so sharply into focus in recent years and months emphasize the call by Nigeria and many other Member States for reform of the Security Council and other United Nations agencies.@@@We need a more effective and representative structure to meet today’s demands, which have outgrown a system designed for the very different world that prevailed at its foundation in 1945.@@@Change is long overdue.@@@This is the first meeting that we are having here in New York without the restrictions that characterized the past three years.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic ripped across national borders like a toxic whirlwind, leaving in its wake a legacy of pain and loss.@@@Happily, we also witnessed an incredible level of innovation and creativity from those who devised treatments and vaccines.@@@Those laudable achievements were underpinned by partnerships and international cooperation.@@@We also saw the bravery, care and endurance of health professionals in every corner of the globe.@@@With the coronavirus, we saw very clearly how States tried to meet the challenge of a threat that could not be contained within national borders.@@@The results were mixed, but at its best, the cooperation among stakeholders was outstanding.@@@It facilitated solutions that saved countless lives and eased a huge burden of human suffering.@@@That same theme of multilateralism, as the promotion of national interests competes with the common cause in the face of an existential threat, has been our recurring experience in recent times.@@@In every address that I have delivered to the Assembly, I have dwelt on the issue of climate change, especially as it fuels conflicts and complicates food security.@@@Climate change reduces opportunity and prosperity, which in Africa, Latin America and some parts of Asia also contributes to transnational organized crime.@@@Last year, as part of Nigeria’s effort to achieve our global net-zero aspirations, my Administration adopted
a national climate-change strategy that aims to deliver climate-change mitigation in a sustainable manner.@@@The measures we took at the national level also require climate justice.@@@Compared to industrialized economies, Africa and other developing nations produce only a small proportion of greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@Yet we are the hardest hit by the consequences of climate change, as we are seeing in the sustained drought in Somalia and the unprecedentedly severe floods in Pakistan.@@@Those and other climate-related occurrences are now suddenly becoming commonplace in the developing world.@@@In effect, we are literally paying the price for policies that others pursue.@@@That must change.@@@At the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow last year, I said that Nigeria was not asking for permission to make the same mistakes that others have made in creating the climate emergency.@@@Fortunately, we now know what we can do to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and the related energy challenges.@@@As a first step, we must all commit to releasing the financing and the technology for creating a stable and affordable framework for energy transmission.@@@Financial development institutions must prioritize de-risking energy projects to improve renewable projects’ access to credit facilities.@@@No country should be left behind in that area.@@@The skyrocketing energy costs worldwide are in part the product of conflict and supply disruptions to Europe and the Americas, yet we are all paying the price.@@@It is therefore our expectation that the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly and the upcoming COP 27 will help galvanize the political will required to drive action towards fulfilling the various existing climate change initiatives.@@@Another feature of the past decade has been the growing partnerships between States and increasingly influential non-State actors.@@@There was a time when the most important events at the Assembly featured statements by the world’s most powerful leaders.@@@Now, a tweet or Instagram post by an influencer on a social or environmental issue may have a greater impact.@@@Technology offers us limitless opportunities and sometimes runs ahead of the imagination of regulators and legislators.@@@At its best, social media helps strengthen the foundation of our society and our common values.@@@At its worst, it is a corrosive digital version of the mob, bristling with intolerance and division.@@@In confronting those challenges, we must also come together to defend freedom of speech while upholding other values that we cherish.@@@We must continue to work for a common standard that balances rights with responsibilities to keep the most vulnerable from harm and help strengthen and enrich communities.@@@Efforts to protect communities from the scourge of disinformation and misinformation must also be matched with efforts to reduce inequalities and restore hope to the poorer and most vulnerable members of our communities, as a means to curb the many socioeconomic conflict drivers that we face.@@@In spite of our efforts, humanitarian crises will continue to ravage some of our communities.@@@Nigeria therefore implores its global partners to do more to complement its endeavours.@@@Indeed, the multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have left a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space.@@@That equally calls for addressing the burden of unsustainable external debt via a global commitment to the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to countries facing fiscal and liquidity challenges, as well as outright cancellation for countries facing the most severe issues.@@@Democracy is an idea that crosses time and borders.@@@Sadly, it has its limitations.@@@The wheels of democracy turn slowly.@@@It can demand compromises that dilute decisions.@@@Sometimes it bends too much to special interests that exercise influence, not always for the general good, in a manner disproportionate to their numbers.@@@However, it has been my experience that a democratic culture provides a Government with the legitimacy it needs to deliver positive change.@@@In Nigeria, not only have we worked to strengthen our democracy, but we have also supported it and promoted the rule of law in our subregion.@@@In the Gambia, we helped guarantee the first democratic transition since independence.@@@In Guinea-Bissau, we stood by the democratically elected Government when it faced mutiny.@@@In Chad, following the tragic death on the battlefield of its President, the late Idriss Deby Itno, we joined forces with its other neighbours and international partners to stabilize the country and encourage a peaceful transition to democracy, a process that is ongoing.@@@We believe in the sanctity of constitutional term limits, and we have steadfastly adhered to them in Nigeria.@@@We have seen the corrosive impact on values when leaders elsewhere seek to change the rules to stay in power.@@@Indeed, we are now preparing for general elections in Nigeria, scheduled for February.@@@At the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, there will be a new face on this rostrum speaking for Nigeria.@@@Ours is a vast country, strengthened by its diversity and common values of hard work, enduring faith and a sense of community.@@@We have invested heavily to strengthen our framework for free and fair elections, and I thank our partners for all the support that they have provided for our elections.@@@As President, I have set the goal that one of the enduring legacies I would like to leave is to entrench a process of free, fair, transparent and credible elections by which Nigerians elect the leaders of their choice.@@@The multiple challenges that we face are truly interconnected and urgent, and the choice of this session’s theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is apt.@@@In keeping with our obligations as Member States of the Organization, we must all do our utmost to work with the President to resolve them.@@@In that regard, I reiterate my delegation’s full and resolute cooperation.@@@Let me convey my final reflections from this famous rostrum.@@@We live in extraordinary times, with interdependent challenges, but enormous opportunities.@@@The pace of change can seem bewildering, with sometimes a palpable and unsettling sense of uncertainty about our future.@@@But if my years in public service have taught me anything, it is that we must keep faith with those values that endure.@@@They include, but are not limited to, such values as justice, honour, integrity, ceaseless endeavour and partnership within and between nations.@@@Our strongest moments have always been those in which we remain true to the basic principles of tolerance, community and abiding commitment to peace and goodwill towards all.@@@I bring greetings from our President, Mr. Surangel S. Whipps Jr., and the people of Palau.@@@It is a great pleasure to be able to address the General Assembly and, at the outset, I wish to congratulate the President of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, Mr. Csaba Korosi, and pledge Palau’s support
during the course of his term.@@@I also wish to thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, a fellow islander — from Maldives — who was gracious enough to take the long journey to Palau during his term, Honourable Minister Abdulla Shahid, for his astute leadership over the course of the last year.@@@We meet at a precarious time.@@@Thankfully, the world has made great strides in collectively combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@The people of Palau thank all our international partners and friends who came to our aid during this difficult time, particularly the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and others.@@@The collaboration was successful in minimizing the impact of the pandemic in our small and vulnerable community.@@@Regrettably, while the world made great progress in pandemic recovery, new and unprecedented challenges have emerged.@@@The war in Ukraine rages on, causing damage to infrastructure, homes, schools and cultural sites, killing innocent people and terrorizing the children of the country.@@@Palau continues to strongly condemn the war in Ukraine and joins the international community in calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine’s sovereign territory.@@@We also extend our prayers to and solidarity with the people of Ukraine.@@@While war may be viewed as a heart attack, the climate crisis has been like diabetes — insidious and wearing us down constantly and consistently year after year.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to join fellow leaders to express my country’s deepest sympathy with our brothers and sisters in Pakistan and those impacted by Hurricane Fiona with respect to the awful climate devastation they have experienced.@@@These catastrophes represent the unfortunate “new normal” for many in small island developing States.@@@Climate change is not only about hurricanes and floods.@@@It is about droughts.@@@It is about wildfires.@@@It is about our ability to provide drinking water and feed our people when our lakes run dry and our aquaculture facilities and reefs are ravaged by typhoons.@@@We face all of these challenges and more in Palau today.@@@Our Government’s inability to buy our children new textbooks or improve their nutrition programmes is because so many of our fiscal resources and energy are dedicated to addressing disaster relief.@@@How many times do the people of our island of Kayangel have to rebuild their homes from storms before they give up?
How many times, Mr. President, does your home have to be swept away before it breaks your spirit?@@@Despite the challenges of this last year, we have begun to see glimmers of hope in the fight against climate change.@@@Youth, the private sector and civil service are more engaged than ever.@@@Over 150,000 young people went up to Glasgow for the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and provided much-needed pressure for leaders to take action, and after four failed Conferences of the Parties, the Glasgow Climate Pact was finally adopted.@@@Even major emitting countries like the United States and Australia have finally passed significant legislation to shift their domestic policies.@@@None of these efforts get us to 1.5°C yet, but they represent a great step forward, and we commend their efforts.@@@As the Russian-driven energy crisis has shown us, energy independence and renewable energy sources build resilience into our economies.@@@Palau has felt the strain of skyrocketing energy costs, which is fuelling our ambition to achieve a 100 per cent transition to renewable energy.@@@In Palau, we have a saying “Sel om tobed el mora buai, em chisngekl mesa blimT Translated, it is like the English saying, “people who live in glass houses should not throw stones”, meaning that before criticizing other people’s actions, one must look at one’s own.@@@It is in this spirit that our President, Mr. Surangel Whipps Jr., has committed to Palau making the transition to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2032.@@@The message that we want to convey is clear: despite our small size, our remote location, our lack of access to financing and technology and the unique vulnerabilities of being a small island developing State (SIDS), we are committed to moving towards a net-zero carbon world.@@@We are committed because our planet and our children need us all to be committed.@@@Palau extends its sincere thanks to the Government of Japan, which has committed a grant to help us update our country’s power grid to allow for the transition to renewables.@@@We are grateful for Japan’s continued friendship and support.@@@Our small country had the pleasure of hosting the seventh Our Ocean Conference, together with the United States, in April of this year.@@@The conference brought together more than 600 participants, representing more than 70 foreign delegations and 150 non-State actors.@@@It
concluded with 410 commitments, worth $16.35 billion.@@@As a SIDS, we thought that it was particularly important to bring people from all over the world to Palau to show them first-hand the challenges that we face as SIDS, whether it is plastic pollution, sea level rise or the impact on our fragile corals, which underpin our major economic driver of blue tourism.@@@The conference also highlighted the importance of ocean-based climate solutions, including shipping decarbonization, marine nature-based solutions and offshore renewable energy, in keeping the 1.5°C global warming target within reach and improving global climate resilience.@@@We are incredibly grateful for the wonderful partnership of the United States in co-hosting the Our Ocean Conference, which was a success due, in large part, to its camaraderie and efforts.@@@We also thank the Republic of China-Taiwan for its generosity and support in upgrading our conference venues.@@@Likewise, we thank our partner Japan and the Sasakawa Foundation for their generosity and significant technical support.@@@Many other partners also contributed to make the event a success for climate action.@@@As a blue ocean State, Palau has been the leader in oceans issues, and we will continue to be.@@@As co-Chair of the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy with Norway, we are pleased to have recently welcomed the United Kingdom as our seventeenth member of the ocean panel, and we are committed to working with it and all panel members to achieve 100 per cent ocean management for a sustainable ocean economy, in which effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity go hand in hand.@@@Palau believes in the 30 by 30 initiative, and we urge all Member States to adopt management plans with a minimum marine protected area covering 30 per cent of the exclusive economic zone.@@@As a large ocean State, we do not believe that there is a sustainable solution to ocean issues without incorporating management and rules in the high seas.@@@The Pacific is disappointed that the efforts of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction could not conclude a treaty text, as the preservation and fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction is long overdue as an extension of the world’s commitment to combating climate change.@@@The opportunity to establish regional marine protected areas, build more maritime surveillance capacity and facilitate the transfer of marine technology should not be further delayed.@@@We owe it to our future generations to come together for the sustainable use of humankind’s common heritage.@@@Palau is a champion of the moratorium on deep- sea mining.@@@The deep sea makes up 90 per cent of the marine environment, and we cannot allow great harm to come to such biologically rich areas.@@@Before any nation is allowed to contract for deep-sea mining projects, the global community must enact serious reform of the International Seabed Authority and international regulations that comply with the mission of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to preserve and protect the marine environment.@@@Let me now turn to an issue that deeply impacts both Palau and SIDS.@@@The adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index cannot be discussed only in financial board rooms, for it has real impacts on the lives of island peoples.@@@The multidimensional vulnerability index analysis by the United Nations Development Programme found that most SIDS are more vulnerable than their income level would suggest.@@@We do not come here as a proud people asking for handouts.@@@However, we need tailored solutions for our problems as small countries and meaningful access to financing.@@@The adoption of the multidimensional vulnerability index facilitates climate action and can bring equity to global financing.@@@As members should know, we have a Compact of Free Association agreement with the United States.@@@In doing so, our people signal that we have shared values with the United States.@@@The United States also promised to help provide for our development needs after Palau gained independence from it.@@@Since the time our Compact was signed, however, some development has occurred, but it is too little.@@@Our economy has not grown sufficiently and is fragile, as demonstrated by a contraction of more than 30 per cent during the past five years.@@@Much of that is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but some to geopolitics.@@@We should not be so vulnerable.@@@We have been forced to borrow more than we should have to, and we lack essential infrastructure.@@@A strength of our association is that it requires the Governments of Palau and the United States to periodically reconsider the relationship and its terms and review Palau’s requirements for assistance for public services and economic development, and it commits both of our Governments to act on the conclusions.@@@The United States has initiated the required thirtieth anniversary review.@@@Its bureaucracy initially proposed unacceptably inadequate assistance, but President Biden appointed an envoy who, we trust, will get his Government to at least meet Palau’s minimum needs so that our people can attain a decent standard of living without having to leave.@@@That is essential to enabling the relationship to endure, as my Government envisions.@@@It hopes that, when we next address the General Assembly, we will be able to report an agreement in that regard.@@@We need greater financial and programmatic assistance and will require those for the foreseeable future and for as long as free association continues.@@@But what we want most are Government measures and public and private investment to grow our economy.@@@We are deeply grateful for the assistance that the United States and other Governments, such as Taiwan and Japan, have provided, but we need more now, just as we need measures to combat and adapt to climate change’s rising seas.@@@In our case, that includes concrete action to enable our people, and, right now, especially our hospital, to move from land that now regularly floods to a higher-elevation area.@@@We continue to view the United Nations as an important mechanism for achieving international peace and security and sustainable development for all countries, but, in particular, for the voiceless and the most vulnerable.@@@I reiterate in the strongest terms that this organ can demonstrate leadership by accepting Taiwan into the United Nations system as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts to promote peace and collaborate on international matters.@@@Most States Members of the United Nations accept Taiwan passports; so, too, should the United Nations system recognize and incorporate the Taiwanese people and enrich this organ with the benefits of their participation.@@@Doing so is a realization of the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The Taiwanese people are part of the global community and a valuable partner in combating climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@With the many challenges facing our planet and people, we need every person, including the 23 million people of Taiwan, to be part of the solutions.@@@When linguists studied our local Palauan language, they discovered that it was anchored in the word “heart”; beltik er reng, which translates as “found heart”, means love.@@@We are a people and a culture who navigate with our hearts, and that is the message that I would like to leave Member States with today.@@@Palau chooses love of self, love of neighbour, love of planet and love as a virtue.@@@We believe that choosing love is our only way forward for collective peace and prosperity.@@@There is no profit sufficiently large to be worth the price of war or the destruction of our planet.@@@Above all the highs and lows of this year, I trust that this institution will take away the importance of unity and respect for the rule of law.@@@We are capable of overcoming the immense challenges of our time, but we must do so together.@@@I am grateful for the immense privilege of joining everyone here in the General Assembly — a privilege made possible by the peaceful democratic transition that followed the free and fair elections held in Kenya on 9 August.@@@Those elections stand as a testimony of the universal power of democracy, as well as the manifest ability of African peoples to invest in stronger nations and a secure future by using robust institutions, effective constitutions and the impartial administration of the rule of law to guarantee the realization of our shared objectives.@@@The General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session comes at a unique moment, as the entire world struggles with multiple grave challenges, including regional conflicts, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the triple planetary crisis, food insecurity and the rising cost of living.@@@I take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election and to express my confidence that his wealth of experience offers us significant assurance of his good leadership.@@@The motto of his presidency, “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”, succinctly captures with particular resonance the urgent imperatives of our time.@@@I assure the President of Kenya’s firm support and cooperation during his tenure.@@@I also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his bold steps in steering the United Nations community and for ensuring its business continuity under the unprecedented circumstances occasioned by multiple global threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Human well-being is under grave threat.@@@The health of the planet requires urgent attention.@@@The immense pressure exerted by conventional threats, such as climate change, the global food crisis, terrorism, cybercrime and armed conflict, has been compounded by the unprecedented and devastating disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@I express my approval of the President’s theme for this year’s session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, because it boldly signals the window of opportunity that we now have to step up our engagement from firm consensus to decisive action.@@@In many respects, the COVID-19 pandemic stripped us of many illusions and exposed stark justice and solidarity deficits in the face of existential crisis.@@@It brought into sharp focus the global economy’s two- lane highway, repressively patrolled by a rising tide of exclusionist nationalism — a spectre that undermines prospects for collective action and significantly impairs the resolve of the international community to guarantee the fundamental rights, including the rights to safety and dignity, of the world’s vulnerable majority.@@@It is also for that reason that many nations, especially in the global South, now advocate the democratization of global governance and a reimagined multilateralism that is inclusive and works for the good of all.@@@Kenya stands ready to work with other nations to achieve the
pan-Africanization of multilateralism and a more just and inclusive system of global governance.@@@It is important to reflect on those matters as we do our best to get our people, enterprises and industries back on their feet so that the engine of development can power our societies towards a prosperity that actually leaves no one behind.@@@“Building back better” is the universal rallying call to incorporate lessons learned into doing more, in a better way, to recover from shocks.@@@I would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to faithfully adhere to that motto by augmenting it, in word and in deed, with an additional “b” to make it “building back better from the bottom”.@@@Building back better from the bottom upwards is essentially about including the marginalized working majority in the economic mainstream.@@@The bottom millions relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a crowded arena that is characterized by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence.@@@The ingenuity, optimism, resilience and energy demonstrated by those in that ever-bustling bottom segment is sometimes called hustling.@@@Invisible to policymakers and beyond the reach of many public services, those hustlers take nothing for granted, surviving overwhelming odds and frequently achieving great success.@@@In the words of Abraham Lincoln, things may come to those who wait, but only the things left behind by those who hustle.@@@It is time to bolster the resilience of our nations to mainstream those millions through deliberate strategies and efforts to advance economic inclusion by building back better from the bottom.@@@The interlocking challenges of conflicts, the triple planetary crisis and the global food crisis have impeded our momentum and obstructed our focus in achieving fundamental transformations towards sustainable development.@@@In the Horn of Africa region, severe drought and the disruption of supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have left us food-insecure.@@@Consequently, we have been constrained to repurpose our strategies to prioritize drought and famine relief to insulate education from disruption and improve social protection and health-care systems in order ensure people’s well-being.@@@Many countries now bear witness to the unsettling phenomena of rivers, canals and water reservoirs drying up owing to droughts and heat waves occasioned by climate change.@@@Kenya is no exception.@@@The northern, arid and semi-arid rangelands of our country have been gravely impacted by drought whose severity has not been experienced in 40 years.@@@The scarce rainfall over three consecutive seasons has led to poor crops and pasture, leaving some 3.1 million residents of those rangelands severely food insecure.@@@That unprecedented confluence of intensely adverse events has exacerbated water scarcity and starvation, which are worsened by rising food prices, thereby complicating Kenya’s road map towards delivering a good quality of life to its citizens and hindering our progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 2.@@@Severe drought has affected not only the Horn of Africa and the Sahel regions; it also continues to devastate many others, including in Asia, Europe and the Americas.@@@If for no other reason, the fact that we are in this together must strengthen the case for concerted efforts across the continents.@@@With that in mind, I call on Member States and all relevant stakeholders to demonstrate strong political will and showcase effective cooperation by supporting the most affected countries both financially and by sharing land-restoration and climate-adaptation technologies.@@@Collaborating to expand inclusion can usher in a new paradigm of multilateralism for us.@@@The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reminds us that we cannot afford to waste another moment debating the merits of doing something versus doing nothing.@@@It will soon be too late to reverse the course of events, and then, even the best possible interventions will not suffice.@@@Every day is an opportunity for us as leaders to expedite our efforts to confront the triple planetary crisis.@@@It should be recalled that during the Stockholm+50 meeting, which Kenya had the honour of co-hosting with Sweden, there was agreement among States on the need to act urgently to address environmental impacts.@@@Given that consensus, it is deeply concerning that little progress has been made with regard to the action that is needed.@@@It is time to collectively contemplate the urgent measures needed to implement the high- priority actions we must take in order to contain the ongoing disruptions, as well as deliberate on longterm implementation approaches to be undertaken.@@@I fully agree with the Secretary-General’s memorable statement, that “[w]e have a rendezvous with climate disaster” (A/77/PV.4, p.3).@@@I add that we must not be taken by surprise.@@@If being forewarned indeed means
being forearmed, this is our opportunity to mobilize with tremendous urgency and take action at once.@@@The agricultural sector has an important part to play in reducing the severity of climate change.@@@A number of practices have a bearing, positive or negative, on various dimensions of the environment.@@@Investing in modern agricultural technology is therefore one important avenue towards tackling prevailing environmental challenges.@@@Kenya is responding through substantial investment in climate-resilient agriculture.@@@At the core of our 10-year strategy for agricultural-sector growth and transformation are nine flagships.@@@They include the registration of farmers to direct incentives, improving farmer practices through customized extension services, the monitoring of emergency food-reserve stocks using a digital food balance sheet and the use of an early-warning system to monitor food supplies and market prices.@@@Agriculture remains the bedrock of the development of many nations and will therefore continue to hold the key to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth for our people.@@@No country, large or small, has ever attained significant growth without modernizing its agricultural sector.@@@And as we rededicate ourselves to those targets, we must, in the immediate term, find answers to the severe deficit in the availability, flow and accessibility of fertilizer to our farmers worldwide.@@@I could not agree more with Secretary-General Guterres’ warning in this Hall yesterday, that
“Without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage” (ibid., p. 2).@@@We are encouraged to note that education, health, agriculture and numerous other public services have become increasingly reliant on digital access.@@@The world needs greater investment in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, accompanied by policies that support innovation and increased acquisition and deployment of technology.@@@In so doing, we should be driven by the conviction that those measures offer a viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development.@@@I call for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT infrastructure in developing countries and bridge the yawning digital divide between the global South and the rest of the world.@@@The General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session follows the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), UNEP@50, as well as Stockholm+50 and the Ocean Conference in Lisbon.@@@The outcomes of those conferences demanded real commitment to addressing global environmental concerns as a matter of urgency and a just transition to sustainable economies that work for all people.@@@The fifth United Nations Environment Assembly’s adoption in Nairobi of the March 2022 landmark resolution to end plastic pollution is a decisive signal that the world is prepared and motivated to act to address that menace.@@@Kenya is committed to working closely with other nations to pursue legally binding instruments aimed at bringing an end to plastic pollution.@@@As the host nation to UNEP and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, Kenya affirms that those critical United Nations agencies have an indispensable role in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, as well as in developing socially and environmentally sound sustainable cities.@@@In keeping with its strong commitment to multilateral institutions, Kenya has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) to facilitate the upgrading of its complex.@@@I take this opportunity to call on Member States to complement that contribution through enhanced financing aimed at adequately modernizing the UNON facilities Nairobi.@@@Kenya remains a strong advocate for making the sustainable use of ocean and blue-economy resources a development priority, holding the firm belief that significantly increased investment in that essential sector can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs and spur economic growth.@@@I urge the Secretary-General to continue calling attention to the urgent need to develop that vital sector.@@@In particular, I call on developed countries to invest in sustainable fishing, protect marine ecosystems and share ocean-based climate solutions with developing countries.@@@For our part, I am pleased to report that, building on the historic 2018 Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, held in Nairobi, Kenya is reviewing its national blue-economy strategy in order to strengthen community structures in the participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources and ecosystems.@@@The strategy is expected to contribute to our economic development through food and
nutrition security, coastal and rural development and income increases along the aquaculture value chains.@@@It will also enhance maritime transport and tourism.@@@We invite development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building the capacity to sustainably utilize marine resources.@@@We must rally together to make the best use of Africa’s vast blue resources in developing our economies while meeting our climate targets.@@@As we look forward to the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, it is logical to expect that Member States will shift their attention towards the development and implementation of frameworks for climate change mitigation.@@@Member States must complete their pending actions so they can turn to the implementation work that lies ahead.@@@I therefore call on all of us to urgently deliver on all commitments made towards climate-change financing.@@@It is critical to emphasize that we are running out of time in that regard.@@@Over the past decade, Kenya has sustained its aggressive pursuit of rapid socioeconomic transformation through three principal road maps.@@@The first road map is the Kenya National Vision 2030, the formal long-term blueprint aimed at transforming Kenya into a newly industrializing, upper-middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment by 2030.@@@The second road map is the African Union’s Agenda 2063.@@@The third road map is the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Kenya seeks to tap into a variety of resources to catalyse the achievement of those interlocking and mutually reinforcing objectives.@@@The disruption and ensuing crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic compelled us to diversify our focus into new interventions, including an economic stimulus programme, a COVID-19 economic recovery strategy and a COVID-19 socioeconomic re-engineering recovery strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic.@@@I confirm that we have done our utmost in the circumstances.@@@Nevertheless, it is not enough.@@@Kenya and the rest of Africa, like other developing countries, are in need of greater international partnership and cooperation to avert economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic.@@@Developing countries, which are heavily burdened by external-debt servicing, run the risk of losing development gains because of the shocks inflicted by the pandemic and associated disruptions.@@@I call on global financial institutions and the international community to take urgent steps to release all existing financial instruments in order to provide much-needed additional liquidity and secure better fiscal space for developing countries such as Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.@@@On behalf of Kenya, I therefore join other leaders in calling on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders to extend pandemic- related debt relief to the worst-hit countries, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@I also urge the Group of 20 to extend and expand the scope of the common framework to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.@@@I would like the Assembly to take a moment to consider the peace and security landscape — one that is currently beset with multiple challenges but also abounds with considerable opportunities.@@@Our home region of East Africa and the Horn of Africa, in particular, is burdened by significant conflicts and challenges that have implications for the region’s development.@@@We stand on the cusp of a vast opportunity to galvanize confidence-building measures in order to generate and sustain momentum towards sustainable peace.@@@In its role as an anchor State in the region, Kenya has sustained our investment in diplomatic efforts to find lasting peace in multiple situations within and beyond the region.@@@Although some processes have yielded undeniable success, challenges remain.@@@I therefore strongly reiterate our call for partnership towards confidence-building measures and urge more concerted efforts to achieve sustainable peace and stability.@@@Kenya is currently serving on the Security Council.@@@I am proud to confirm that our engagement over the past two years has prioritized regional peace and security, countering terrorism and violent extremism, peace support operations and climate and security as critical contributions to collective efforts to build a safer, more prosperous and peaceful world.@@@I am also proud to state that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means for achieving international peace and security.@@@Kenya continues to advocate the renewal of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture, which draws comparative strength from the highly productive complementarity among the United Nations, the African Union and the regional economic communities.@@@Working closely with the other two elected African members of the Security Council, we are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council and achieving a consensus-driven, rules-based multilateral system.@@@It is our manifest intention to see greater pan- Africanization of the global agenda in order to make multilateralism work for the people of the world in their diversity.@@@It is time for multilateralism to reflect the voices of the farmers, represent the hopes of villagers, champion the aspirations of pastoralists, defend the rights of fisherfolk, express the dreams of traders, respect the wishes of workers and indeed protect the welfare of all the peoples of the global South.@@@Let me express my country’s strong collective conviction that the relevance, legitimacy and moral authority of the United Nations will forever remain deficient and undermined in the absence of comprehensive reforms of the Security Council.@@@We therefore remain firmly committed to reforming the Security Council to make it a more effective, representative and democratic global institution.@@@Given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, one that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy required to deal with threats to international peace and security.@@@A just and inclusive world order cannot be spearheaded by a Security Council that persistently and unjustly fails the inclusivity criterion.@@@Similarly, threats to democracy will not be credibly resolved by an undemocratic and unrepresentative Security Council.@@@It is vitally important for that critical institution to reflect the values it is entrusted to protect, defend and uphold on behalf of humankind.@@@We welcome the call by President Biden this morning for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council as a significant step in the right direction and look forward to building consensus towards realizing that.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted health systems, thereby seriously challenging the implementation of programmes that are vital for the realization of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@To place us firmly back on track and accelerate our progress towards the SDG targets, it is imperative for us to foster sustainable partnerships among Governments, other State actors, civil society and the private sector.@@@That modality of collective action is particularly vital for building resilient health systems, whose importance in enabling us to withstand future pandemics and other health crises can no longer be disputed.@@@For that reason, Kenya will continue to strongly support the development of legally binding World Health Organization international instruments in order to anchor global solidarity and promote equity.@@@The fact is that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed, for all the world to see, the severe deficit of those critical values in our current multilateral configuration.@@@Global supply chains remained impervious to demand in the global South generally and to Africa in particular.@@@Unequal access to vaccines underscored that unjust and unequal situation, with unforgettable clarity.@@@Whenever human life, security and welfare are in jeopardy, it is immoral to administer interventions through frameworks that are anchored on fundamental inequality.@@@We are all witnesses to admirable demonstrations of effective solidarity in response to crises in various parts of the world.@@@Our knowledge of the possibility of spontaneous, yet resolute, global solidarity reinforces the African exception as particularly repugnant.@@@From genocides and civil conflict to famine and pandemics, the African continent is consistently left behind to bear the brunt of weak solidarity and the disastrous failure of multilateralism.@@@History indicates that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, and the character of the ensuing interventions casts a long shadow to date.@@@Not to put too fine a point on it, but the failure of multilateralism during crises, which relegates the people of Africa outside the circle of moral consideration and normalizes humanitarian neglect and other casual injustices, is a failure of humankind.@@@Nothing about Africa — I repeat, nothing about Africa or its peoples — makes it acceptable for that type of failure to persist in this era, and we have an urgent moral duty to do better and right that wrong.@@@For decades, Africa has borne the brunt of three epidemics — HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.@@@I applaud innovative partnerships such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for their progress in addressing the three menaces.@@@I also welcome the ambitious targets set for the seventh replenishment cycle.@@@Kenya is committed to supporting the Global Fund and implementing agreed targets in order to actualize our pledge at the Replenishment Conference.@@@Kenya calls upon all countries implementing the Global Fund programmes, especially fellow African States, to remain at the forefront in championing the successful replenishment of the Fund.@@@In that way, the mobilization of much-needed resources will be enhanced, thereby bringing us closer to the elimination of those dangerous diseases.@@@In conclusion, Kenya joins the Secretary-General in calling for the strengthening of multilateralism as the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable and prosperous world for all.@@@That is the imperative of our time and the call of this moment.@@@It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe.@@@The theme of the seventy-seventh session, “A watershed moment:	transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, demands that we recognize that the crises we must confront are interlinked in a complicated way.@@@They can be effectively addressed only through more imaginative strategies and innovative formulas.@@@A population of 8 billion people, in a densely networked world, increasingly looks up to the multilateral system as the anchor of their individual aspirations, both directly and indirectly through robust national frameworks.@@@Therefore, the United Nations system is increasingly expected to be responsive to those needs, and the proceedings in forums such as the General Assembly are expected to speak to ordinary people in the far-flung reaches of our incredibly diverse globe.@@@It is impossible to address all their individual needs directly, but it is possible to respond to all of them by speaking with conviction to the universal values of equality, inclusion, justice, solidarity and collective action, while making sure that all our interventions effectively reflect them, with clarity.@@@The integrity of the international order must be measured by the distance separating our resolutions, consensus and agreement from decisive actions, committed interventions and effective solutions.@@@A watershed moment therefore demands that we reduce that gap drastically and quickly.@@@Kenya pursues numerous essential domestic agendas through the multilateral framework.@@@We are heavily invested in the strength, effectiveness and eventual success of all the interventions formulated by the United Nations.@@@It is important that the output of this forum and other similar forums achieve immediate resonance in the minds and lives of our young people, who still seek the opportunity to express and actualize themselves; our farmers, who work to feed our nations; our jua kali entrepreneurs, who strive in pursuit of success in the informal economy; and our professionals, who formulate policy, implement strategy and monitor service delivery in the public and private sectors.@@@Africa places immense value on the international community and the tremendous possibilities it can unlock through inclusive, sustainable and effective action to transform the lives of our peoples and establish lasting peace, security and shared prosperity.@@@This watershed moment is our chance to turn the key and open that door of opportunity.@@@We can make progress in addressing the triple global threats and liberate ourselves from the shame of the past failures of multilateralism.@@@At this watershed moment, we must not only choose but also act decisively to bequeath to our children and their children a greener, safer, healthier and more abundant Earth.@@@Let us do it together — inclusively and multilaterally.@@@We would like to extend to the President of the General Assembly and his friendly country the Republic of Hungary our congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@We express our solidarity with him and all Member States to ensure the successful work of the Assembly during this session.@@@We also appreciate the efforts of the former President at the previous session.@@@We would be remiss not to thank and commend His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless efforts in leading this Organization and advancing its noble missions while developing its working methods to enhance its effectiveness and adapt to the current needs.@@@We assure him that the Sultanate of Oman will continue to support his efforts in achieving justice and peace all over the world.@@@The Sultanate of Oman pursues a well-established policy based on a deep and steadfast vision, as well as a legacy drawn from its cultural heritage and human history.@@@Therefore, it affirms the fundamentals of its foreign policy in siding with truth and justice, strengthening constructive cooperation and the bonds of friendship, and contributing to the consolidation of international peace and security.@@@The Sultanate of Oman is confident that establishing and maintaining peace in the world is necessary for the interests of its peoples.@@@That can only be preserved on the basis of sound principles of justice and firm foundations of cooperation and harmony among all nations.@@@We call on the international community to be guided by those principles and to build partnerships among countries in accordance with international law and customary practices that are unanimously accepted in order to achieve peaceful coexistence, enhanced cooperation and economic prosperity.@@@My country continues to spare no effort to achieve peace in brotherly Yemen through constructive cooperation with all parties.@@@While the Sultanate of Oman welcomes the continued truce, it appeals to all Yemeni actors to come to terms with their painful past and focus on formulating an optimistic and happy future for their country that will preserve its unity, security and stability, based on the agreed terms of reference, including the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcome of the intra-Yemeni dialogue and the relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@In that context, the Sultanate of Oman will continue to support the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Mr. Hans Grundberg, and the United States Special Envoy for Yemen, Mr. Tim Lenderking.@@@We appreciate their endeavours to achieve a lasting peace in Yemen through dialogue.@@@We also call on all Yemeni parties to engage in a meaningful and serious manner in order to implement the road map agreed upon by our Yemeni brothers and to establish a political process that will safeguard the sovereignty, independence, security and stability of Yemen.@@@My country affirms that it will continue to provide all possible facilities and humanitarian assistance to the various Yemeni regions and governorates without exception, in the hope that sustained international action will bring an end to the suffering of the brotherly people of Yemen.@@@Resolving the Palestinian question remains an essential pillar of ensuring stability in the Middle East.@@@That conflict has generated many crises, tensions and acts of violence.@@@Therefore, we believe that a two-State solution, in accordance with international resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, is an urgent need and a strategic necessity for achieving lasting peace, mutual trust and positive cooperation among all parties in the region.@@@We also note the unfolding developments in Libya, Syria and the Sudan.@@@We hope that differences will be resolved by consensus among the political parties and that the concept of a shared destiny will be consolidated in order to achieve security and stability for those sisterly countries.@@@We call on the international community to redouble its diplomatic efforts to support peace and stability in order to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian crisis through dialogue and negotiation, which are the most successful means of resolving differences, in accordance with the principles of international law and common human values.@@@My country looks forward to participating actively in the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), which will be held in Sharm el-@@@Sheikh, Egypt, in November.@@@We wish the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt success in hosting that conference.@@@Climate change is one of the most prominent issues of our time, and we are now at a decisive moment.@@@The world is facing a real and difficult challenge with wide-ranging effects, whether rising temperatures or catastrophic floods, all of which are threats to countries’ food security.@@@Adapting to those issues will be more difficult and costly unless the world unites to address them in a radical and integrated way.@@@In that regard, Oman has developed a national strategy for protecting the environment and addressing climate change to be managed in partnership with local communities, civil- society institutions and the private sector.@@@We have established a national committee for climate change and the protection of the ozone layer, consisting of 31 governmental agencies through which adaptation plans are implemented to mitigate the effects of climate fluctuations and to contribute to reducing carbon emissions by 7 per cent by 2030, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We are thereby moving towards achieving zero greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@My country is focused on accelerating the procedures for regulating the green hydrogen sector and encouraging investment in it, in response to global transformations aimed at reducing carbon emissions and fulfilling the world’s desire for new and multiple-use energy sources.@@@In view of the importance of strengthening that sector, my country has established a national alliance for hydrogen by relying on our national capabilities, including an abundance of solar and wind energy, in addition to suitable lands for establishing such projects.@@@And thanks to Oman’s favourable geographic location on the world map, we also have a port system and logistical support for developing and producing clean energy.@@@My country bases its principles of equality, justice and non-discrimination among society’s various segments on our nation’s State statute.@@@Omani women, with their diverse political, social, economic and cultural views, are therefore able to contribute alongside men to building our modern State and promoting cooperation and harmony among all.@@@Women are key partners in development and a true component of our society.@@@We are proud of what we have achieved in the advancement of women and their valuable national contribution in the areas of action and social responsibility.@@@Young people play an equally great role in embodying promising hopes and a bright future for comprehensive development.@@@My country has provided various incentives and opportunities that are characterized by fairness, transparency and equal opportunities for all.@@@The successive crises and existing conflicts that we are seeing have unquestionably all created challenges for the United Nations system.@@@We therefore call on the international community to use genuine and realistic partnerships to rebuild, by uniting ranks and forgiving obstructive lapses while moving forward with a positive vision for a more promising future for all humankind.@@@In conclusion, we want to wish for peace for all.@@@We also wish the Assembly every success in this session with a view to enabling us to achieve the hopes and aspirations of our world.@@@And we hope that members will enjoy the remarkable and memorable FIFA World Cup competition to be held in our sister State of Qatar in November.@@@The Secretary-General’s landmark report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) has only increased in value since it was launched a year ago.@@@The world is in a state of turbulence, with intersecting crises growing in scale and severity, including climate change, food price inflation, conflict and uncontrolled migration.@@@Those challenges all require multilateral cooperation and efforts.@@@Yet the perception that the international system is no longer up to the task has only deepened, particularly where the interests of powerful members are at stake.@@@In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, recent setbacks have served to highlight that the security situation is fundamentally no different than it was 20 years ago, when the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission was first deployed.@@@That has exposed neighbouring States, notably Rwanda, to cross-border attacks that are entirely preventable.@@@There is an urgent need to find the political will to finally address the root causes of instability in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@The blame game does not solve the problems.@@@Such challenges are not insurmountable, and solutions can be found.@@@That would ultimately be much less costly in terms of both money and human lives.@@@Despite shortcomings, there are examples to demonstrate that international cooperation can successfully address the issues that matter to all of us.@@@Global health is a case in point.@@@The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has helped save countless lives, in Africa and beyond, while also strengthening health systems.@@@I hope that all countries will respond strongly and sustain their commitments at the seventh Global Fund replenishment meeting, to chaired by President Biden later today.@@@Africa is doing its part, but it must do more.@@@For sustainability, external funding must go hand in hand with increased domestic financing for health.@@@That is a priority, which the African Union is tracking on an annual basis, and which I am honoured to lead on behalf of the organization.@@@We are also working with partners to bring end- to-end vaccine manufacturing to our continent, notably through collaboration with BioNTech and strong support from the European Union.@@@That is critical to increasing Africa’s resilience against future pandemics.@@@I commend the Secretary-General for convening the Transforming Education Summit earlier this week.@@@The future of billions of children and young people across the world depends on overcoming the challenges of inclusion and quality of instruction, particularly as we recover from the pandemic.@@@Away from the headlines, the United Nations and other multilateral institutions retain the ability to set an agenda around which we can all rally.@@@At the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, leaders adopted an ambitious programme of action, including special instruments on living lands, urbanization and child-care protection and reform.@@@We also agreed to prioritize public-private partnerships to create digital jobs for young people across the Commonwealth.@@@The future is digital, and transformation is happening now, as evidenced by the ongoing work of the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development and the Smart Africa secretariat.@@@High-@@@quality digital jobs are a practical response to the underlying drivers of irregular migration by closing the human-capital investment gap that separates high- and low-income countries.@@@To ensure that the benefits are equally shared, we must continue to invest equitably in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence.@@@In the area of peacebuilding and counter-terrorism, regional initiatives can complement the important work of the United Nations.@@@Regional and bilateral initiatives have been proved to make a big difference, whether in the Central African Republic or the successful engagement to contain violent extremism in northern Mozambique, conducted by Rwanda and the Southern African Development Community.@@@If that approach were tried properly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as proposed by the Nairobi process, it would make a difference.@@@However, to be sustainable, such efforts require consistent financial support from the international community.@@@A great deal is at stake, and time is not on our side.@@@We cannot anticipate or prevent every crisis, but we can be better prepared to react quickly and effectively when needed, especially if we work together.@@@In the past year, our world experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods and droughts; the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; inflation; and a brutal, needless war — a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt.@@@Let me speak plainly.@@@A permanent member of the Security Council invaded its neighbour and attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map.@@@Russia shamelessly violated the core tenets of the Charter of the United Nations, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force.@@@Just today, President Putin once again made overt nuclear threats against Europe, in reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime.@@@Now Russia is calling up more soldiers to join the fight, and the Kremlin is organizing sham referendums to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the Charter.@@@The world should see those outrageous acts for what they are.@@@Putin claims that he had to act because Russia was threatened.@@@But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict.@@@In fact, we warned it was coming, and we worked with many who are here today to try to avert it.@@@Putin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable.@@@Just before he invaded, he asserted that Ukraine was “created by Russia” and had never had “real statehood”.@@@And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals and centres of Ukrainian history and culture.@@@We have just seen even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity crimes and war crimes; mass graves have been uncovered in Izyum.@@@The bodies, according to those who excavated them, show signs of torture.@@@This war, plain and simple, is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a State and as a people.@@@Anyone, anywhere, regardless of what they believe — that should make their blood run cold.@@@That is why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine.@@@The United States has marshalled massive amounts of security assistance, humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine — more than $25 billion to date.@@@Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well.@@@More than 40 countries represented here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself.@@@The United States is also working closely with its allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, deter attacks against NATO territory and hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes.@@@Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for — everything.@@@Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers.@@@But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate.@@@We chose liberty.@@@We chose sovereignty.@@@We chose principles to which every party to the Charter of the United Nations is beholding.@@@We stood with Ukraine.@@@Like everyone here, the United States wants this war to end on just terms — terms we all signed up for — that a nation cannot seize the territory of another by force.@@@The only country standing in the way of that is Russia.@@@Therefore, we — all the members of the General Assembly who are determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as States Members of the United Nations — must be clear, firm and unwavering in our resolve.@@@Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation.@@@We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine.@@@We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression — period.@@@It is no secret that, in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States — and I
as President — champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy.@@@The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world, because I believe that democracy remains humankind’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time.@@@We are working with the Group of Seven and like-minded countries to prove that democracies can deliver both for their citizens and for the rest of the world.@@@But as we meet today, the Charter’s very basis of a stable and just rules-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage.@@@The United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, but it was also negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to working for peace.@@@As President Truman said in 1945, the Charter of the United Nations is
“proof that nations, like men, can state their
differences, can face them, and then can find
common ground on which to stand”.@@@That common ground was so straightforward and basic@@@that today 193 Member States have willingly embraced its principles.@@@And standing up for those principles — for the Charter — is the job of every responsible Member State.@@@I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed.@@@To stand against global politics of fear and coercion, to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones and to embrace basic principles such as freedom of navigation, respect for international law and arms control — no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground on which we must stand.@@@The United States wants to work with all who are still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world.@@@I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world.@@@Members of the Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the Charter and refrain — I repeat — refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, in order to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective.@@@That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council.@@@That includes granting permanent seats to those nations we have long supported to receive them, as well as to countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.@@@The United States is committed to that vital work.@@@In every region, we have pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests — from elevating the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in the Indo-Pacific and signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas, to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work towards a more peaceful and integrated Middle East and hosting the United States-@@@Africa Leaders Summit scheduled for December.@@@As I said last year (see A/76/PV.3), the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives — all people’s lives — including tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; and feeding the world — I repeat — feeding the world.@@@We made that our priority, and one year later we are keeping that promise.@@@From the day I came to office, we have led with a bold climate agenda.@@@We rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and helped get two thirds of the world’s gross domestic product on track in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C.@@@And now I have signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion allocated to climate change.@@@That includes allocating tens of billions of dollars for new investments in offshore wind and solar energy, doubling down on zero-emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency and supporting clean manufacturing.@@@Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce United States emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean- energy-powered economic growth.@@@Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean- energy technologies worldwide, not just in the United States.@@@That is a global game changer — and none too soon.@@@We do not have much time.@@@We all know that we are already living in a climate crisis.@@@No one seems to doubt it after this past year.@@@As we meet, much of Pakistan is still under water.@@@It needs help.@@@Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought.@@@Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they will survive.@@@That is the human cost of climate change — and it is growing, not lessening.@@@Therefore, as I announced last year, in order to meet our global responsibility, my Administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate financing to help lower- income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition.@@@The key part of that will be the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience plan, which will help half a billion people, especially vulnerable countries, to adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience.@@@That need is enormous.@@@Let this therefore be the moment when we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable and clean energy economy to preserve our planet.@@@With regard to global health, we delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries’ needs, all of it free of charge with no strings attached.@@@We are also working closely with the Group of 20 and other countries.@@@And the United States has helped take the lead in establishing the ground-breaking new financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response at the World Bank.@@@At the same time, we have continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges.@@@Later today, I will host the seventh Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.@@@With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.@@@I therefore look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the Conference, resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history.@@@We are also confronting the food crisis head-on.@@@With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute food insecurity — a jump of 40 million in one year — lam announcing today another $2.9 billion in United States support for life-saving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.@@@Russia in the meantime is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the food crisis on the sanctions imposed by many countries in the world in response to the aggression against Ukraine.@@@Let me be perfectly clear: our sanctions explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer.@@@There is no limitation.@@@It is Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.@@@I am grateful for the work being done here at the United Nations, including the leadership of the Secretary-General, in establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months.@@@We need to make sure that it is extended.@@@We believe strongly in the need to feed the world.@@@That is why the United States is the world’s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 per cent of its budget.@@@We are leading support of UNICEF’s efforts to feed children around the world.@@@In order to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced the Roadmap for Global Food Security — Call to Action to eliminate global food insecurity, which more than 100 Member States have already supported.@@@In June, the Group of Seven announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world.@@@Through the Feed the Future initiative of the United States Agency for International Development, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less.@@@We are also calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering.@@@In every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing else matters.@@@As we look to the future, we are working with our partners to update and create the rules of the road for the new challenges we face in the twenty-first century.@@@We launched the European Union-United States Trade and Technology Council with the European Union in order to ensure that key technologies are developed and governed in a way that benefits everyone.@@@With our partner countries and through the United Nations, we are supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those
who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security.@@@With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region, we are working to build a new economic ecosystem in which every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable and shared.@@@That is why the United States has championed a global minimum tax, and we will work to see it implemented so that major corporations pay their fair share everywhere.@@@That was also the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies.@@@We are working with our partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Pacific island States to support a vision for a critical Indo- Pacific region that is free, open, connected, prosperous, secure and resilient.@@@Together with partners around the world, we are working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.@@@As Russia’s war roils the global economy, we are also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries in order to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world.@@@Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let us meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments and high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment and that are keyed to the needs of the communities they serve and not to the contributor.@@@That is why the United States, together with fellow Group of Seven partners, launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.@@@We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through that partnership by 2027.@@@Dozens of projects are already under way — industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola and a first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania.@@@Those are investments that will deliver returns, not just for those countries but for everyone.@@@The United States will work with every nation, including its competitors, to solve global problems like climate change.@@@Climate diplomacy is not a favour to the United States or any other nation, and walking away from it hurts the entire world.@@@Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China.@@@As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader.@@@We do not seek conflict.@@@We do not seek a cold war.@@@We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.@@@But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations — investments that are designed not to foster dependency but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient, as well as partnerships that are not intended to create political obligations but are based on the conviction that our own success and the success of each one of us is increased when other nations succeed as well.@@@When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits.@@@Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution, increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere.@@@The United States will not waver in its unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world.@@@And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.@@@We remain committed to our One China Policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades.@@@And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.@@@We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people.@@@In Venezuela, where years of political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge for a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections.@@@We continue to stand with our neighbour in Haiti as it faces politically fuelled gang violence and an enormous humanitarian crisis.@@@And we call on the world to do the same.@@@We have more to do.@@@We will continue to back the United Nations-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people who have suffered years of war.@@@We will also continue to advocate for a lasting negotiated peace between the Jewish and democratic State of Israel and the Palestinian people.@@@The United States is committed to Israel’s security — period.@@@And a
negotiated two-State solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the State which to which they are entitled, with both sides fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens and both peoples enjoying an equal measure of freedom and dignity.@@@Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy.@@@No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures.@@@A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.@@@The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January.@@@But today we are seeing disturbing trends.@@@Russia shunned the non-proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@And as I said earlier, today they are making irresponsible threats to use nuclear weapons.@@@China is conducting an unprecedented and concerning nuclear build-up without any transparency.@@@Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate United Nations sanctions.@@@While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.@@@I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve that outcome.@@@The non-proliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution.@@@We cannot let the world now slide backwards, and neither can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights.@@@Perhaps singular among this organ’s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves.@@@They made clear in 1948 that human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve.@@@Yet today in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma and the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan.@@@And today we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran, who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.@@@But here is what I know: the future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, in which women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and can contribute fully to building stronger economies and more resilient societies; religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; the LGBTQ+ community and individuals can live and love freely without being targeted with violence; and citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal.@@@The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations in our own country and around the world.@@@Let me end with this: this institution, guided by the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope.@@@Let me say that once again: it is an act of dauntless hope.@@@I ask everyone to think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smouldering, and to think about how divided the people of the world must have felt, with their fresh grief for the millions dead and the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.@@@They had every right to believe only the worst of humankind.@@@Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better — enduring peace, comity among nations, equal rights for every member of the human family and cooperation for the advancement of all humankind.@@@The challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater.@@@Our commitment must be greater still.@@@Let us therefore stand together to once again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the Charter and that we still believe that by working together we can bend the arc of history towards a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it.@@@We are not passive witnesses to history.@@@We are the authors of history.@@@We can do this — we have to do it — for ourselves, for our future and for humankind.@@@At the outset, we would like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@With his vast experience, we are confident that he will successfully provide the leadership required during his tenure as President of the General Assembly.@@@We pay tribute, of course, in the same manner to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his unwavering dedication and excellent stewardship of the Assembly at its seventy- sixth session.@@@We are meeting here at a very difficult time when global challenges have not only multiplied but have become more complex.@@@Those challenges include the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; climate change; the war in Ukraine and its associated effects on and disruptions to supply chains; food insecurity around the world; and high commodity and energy prices, as well as the overall high cost of living.@@@They have cast a dark shadow over the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on our continent and around the world.@@@The risk of reversal in our hard-won development gains is very real.@@@COVID-19 unmasked global inequalities that stretch well beyond income and political boundaries, as the variations in access to vaccines have shown.@@@The risks of further inequality are also real, especially for our developing countries, whose capacity to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change is inadequate, sadly, in spite of our insignificant carbon footprint.@@@This is truly a defining moment of our time in which we must channel our collective efforts to address the numerous challenges that we face.@@@That is why Zambia welcomes the challenge to build on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and endorses the call to convene a summit of the future.@@@We call for arriving at a pact for the future that underwrites a new form of multilateralism in our world — one where major challenges are faced together, in solidarity, within the context of a revitalized international order that is rules-based, fair and inclusive, with the United Nations at the centre of it all.@@@As a country two thirds of whose population is below the age of 25, the outlook for the future and an emphasis on intergenerational equity are very important to us.@@@Our Government seeks to harness that demographic dividend by investing in its youthful and energetic population for a better future.@@@We therefore support the establishment of the United Nations Youth Office.@@@That should encourage the meaningful engagement of young people in diverse ways, such as in political representation, access to lifelong skills training and education, support for youth innovation and entrepreneurship and indeed in decision-making in all areas of life, including climate change and environmental protection.@@@In spite of the steady progress that has been made in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic, we still need to remain vigilant to guard against the possibility of its resurgence.@@@We have all experienced the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly with the loss of millions of our loved ones and disruptions to socioeconomic activities across the world.@@@As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, it is therefore essential to find lasting solutions, including by investing in resilient health systems that will respond to future pandemics such as COVID-19, among others.@@@That means establishing a versatile international public health regime that will shun the hoarding of vaccines
and related technologies in order to guarantee the rapid deployment of supplies from a global reserve for tackling future pandemics.@@@The re-emergence of polio in our world is of great concern.@@@For that reason, together with a number of countries in our region, Zambia is participating in supplementary immunization activities in order to prevent and halt the spread of the wild poliovirus type 1.@@@That is in addition to ongoing activities to fight other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, as well as to strengthen our routine immunization and maintain essential maternal and child health services.@@@As the Global Cholera Control Champion — with many thanks to the World Health Organization, which gave us the opportunity to serve in that role — we must continue our fight against cholera with vigour.@@@We also need to remain alert to any possible outbreaks of monkeypox, the Ebola virus or other such threats.@@@The international community must also work together to address the growing threat to environmental, human and animal health resulting from antimicrobial resistance, commonly referred to as drug resistance.@@@Drug- resistant bacterial infections continue to cause millions of deaths.@@@Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, bears the greatest burden of resistant bacterial infections, which account for a large proportion of deaths in our regions.@@@That calls for better control systems when it comes to access to antimicrobial medicines for both human and animal use.@@@I shall now focus on other areas of interest.@@@With regard to economic performance, the crisis in Ukraine has hampered the recovery that was slowly taking hold, particularly in the developing world, where large sections of society remain in extreme poverty and inequalities widen by the day.@@@Countries that have seen their attainment of the SDGs go off-track must intensify their national consultative processes and stakeholder engagements and renew their commitments to reducing poverty, tackling energy poverty, supporting debt restructuring and enhancing access to concessional financing, which is very important for our own national development agendas.@@@For our part, we hereby indicate in that regard our intention to present our second voluntary national review in July 2023 to highlight Zambia’s progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Despite the challenging external environment, our resolve to rebuild the Zambian economy is stronger than ever before.@@@Our economic recovery is on track, as evidenced by positive growth indicators and the stabilization of key macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, market stability and inflation, which we have been able to bring down from 25 per cent to 9.8 per cent in just one year in office.@@@Zambia is on a path of growth from the economic contraction we experienced in the past, which was somewhere in the region of minus 2 per cent, to a gross domestic product now estimated to grow at approximately 3 per cent.@@@That means we have seen economic growth of approximately 5 per cent in the past 12 months, which was difficult to achieve but was possible with a lot of hard work.@@@Nevertheless, we still want to do more.@@@In terms of social economic benefits, our commitment to providing equal opportunities, especially for young people, has been demonstrated by the introduction of free primary and secondary education, as we believe that without a doubt, education is the best equalizer, the best investment and the best inheritance.@@@Consistent with our pledge to invest in human capital, we have recruited more than 30,000 teachers and 11,000 health workers in 2022 alone.@@@We are decentralizing service delivery and have increased the allocation of our constituency development fund by more than 1,000 per cent in our first budget in office.@@@That is just the beginning.@@@The expenditure of those funds at the community level is meant to ensure inclusive and sustainable economic growth that will support the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises and employment creation across all of our 10 provinces and 156 constituencies.@@@I am pleased to note that in principle we have reached an agreement with our creditors under the Common Framework for Debt Treatments to restructure the national debt we inherited.@@@We have also effectively concluded a deal with the International Monetary Fund based on our important home-grown economic transformation plan.@@@We are very grateful to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations system as a whole and other cooperating partners for their support.@@@The adverse effects of climate change have continued to ravage our planet.@@@In addressing the emerging global climate crisis, I would like to point to a recent situation in Zambia, where in a single season one half of the country experienced total crop failure due to extreme drought while the other half experienced floods.@@@That is obviously not normal.@@@Those are the negative effects of climate change.@@@Such extreme weather events are a
timely reminder of the grave consequences of climate change.@@@Without a doubt, we need robust solutions and cohesion in our approach at the global and regional levels to address the effects of climate change.@@@As Chair of the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, Zambia calls for enhanced global efforts to address the issue, which should include increased financial support for countries with limited resources to mitigate and adapt to the negative effects of climate change.@@@Zambia has mainstreamed green growth and climate-change proofing in its current national development plan, which has articulated broad policy measures for transitioning Zambia into a climate-resilient and inclusive green economy over time.@@@Thirdly, Zambia has continued to build on efforts to attain gender equality and inclusivity in various sectors of our society.@@@Based on empirical evidence, the empowerment of women and poverty alleviation are positively correlated.@@@It is therefore imperative that we dedicate corresponding efforts to ensuring that gender disparities are curtailed at all levels.@@@Under its national gender policy, Zambia has been implementing affirmative action in favour of women and girls to ensure that their full potential is realized at all times.@@@To complement those measures, Zambia is championing the campaign to end child marriage in Africa, and of course all over the world.@@@In the same vein, we are proud to inform the Assembly that earlier today, Zambia, Canada and other cooperating partners held a side event to galvanize support and review the commitment of the international community to ending child, early and forced marriage.@@@With the assurances made during that event, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve target 5.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 5, on gender equality, in our programming, which aims to eliminate that harmful practice.@@@The world at large has grappled with growing instability and insecurity over the past year and the effects have been felt by millions of people around the world as lives and livelihoods have been lost everywhere.@@@Zambia believes that without peace and stability, our joint development efforts will be in vain — I repeat, totally in vain.@@@We are therefore committed to remaining strong advocates of peace and stability in Southern Africa, on the entire African continent and the world over.@@@Our guiding principle is that instability anywhere is instability everywhere.@@@That reminds us that ending war and conflict is not only the responsibility of those directly involved in the conflict but also a shared obligation of every global citizen and every nation.@@@I mean all of us, without exception.@@@We cannot afford to allow instability to derail our noble programmes to better the lives of our people.@@@We therefore take this matter seriously and will continue to actively participate in efforts to restore peace in all the troubled regions of our global village.@@@As the incoming Chair of the Southern African Development Community organ for politics, defence and security cooperation, Zambia will prioritize the restoration of peace and stability in our own country, to start with, and in the region.@@@As the saying goes, charity begins at home.@@@At the continental level, Zambia remains engaged and committed to the efforts of the African Union and the United Nations to promote peace in various conflict areas around the world.@@@Going forward, I would argue that our United Nations system should tilt more efforts towards the prevention of conflicts, which is more cost-effective and palatable.@@@As a signatory to various disarmament treaties and conventions, Zambia remains committed to promoting global peace and security.@@@Zambia joins other Governments in expressing particular concern about the ongoing war in Ukraine.@@@As we stand with all who are affected, in both Ukraine and its neighbours, we also want to take this opportunity to stress the far-reaching negative consequences of the war, particularly for the price of food, fuel, fertilizer and other key commodities across the world.@@@In any part of the world, war has a damaging effect on economic activity, which derails our collective fight against poverty and hunger.@@@A few months of war can erase decades of progress, and I want to emphasize that.@@@We must take note of it.@@@We therefore categorically condemn war anywhere and continue to urge all the parties involved to pursue diplomatic solutions for conflict resolution.@@@I would like to emphasize that our United Nations should continue its peace efforts in this particular conflict.@@@The efforts of the President and all of us collectively are well recognized.@@@I am grateful for that.@@@We would like to stress that global ambitions for peace and security largely depend on the effectiveness of the Security Council.@@@However, the inadequacies of the Council’s current structure have become increasingly pronounced, with the ceding to the General Assembly of decision-making on matters of global peace and security that would otherwise have been the preserve of the Security Council and that should be the preserve
of the Security Council.@@@However, the burden has now been pushed onto the General Assembly.@@@That is not right, and it brings to the fore the need for long- overdue reform of the Council.@@@We appreciate the call from President Biden for greater inclusivity in the Security Council.@@@We therefore continue to advance the African Common Position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, to ensure the effectiveness, credibility and legitimacy of our Security Council.@@@In conclusion, we would like to reaffirm Zambia’s commitment to the fundamental principles on which the United Nations was founded and that safeguard our shared future of peace and prosperity for all nations, not just for some.@@@I shall emphasize that point — the principles that safeguard our shared future of peace, stability and prosperity for all nations.@@@It is my pleasure to greet the Assembly on behalf of Iraq, a founding State Member of the Organization that hosts us today.@@@I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and am confident in his expertise and competence in achieving the desired objectives of this session.@@@I extend my sincere thanks to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his vital role in leading this organ over the past years and in supporting and assisting the Government of Iraq.@@@Our people will always be grateful and appreciative of his efforts.@@@Iraq is a country deeply rooted in history and human memory.@@@It represents a living example of how hope prevails over significant challenges that may seem difficult, especially at the level of domestic political conflict.@@@However, the spirit of hope embodied by the people of Iraq makes them capable of taking advantage of opportunities to live and achieve progress and peace while overcoming conflicts, crises and challenges.@@@Despite all the difficult circumstances, Iraqis wielded that spirit of hope to fight terrorism and defeat it on behalf of the entire world.@@@The task was arduous.@@@Our people made enormous sacrifices not only to liberate their land from the terrorist gangs of Da’esh but also to prevent that dangerous organization from threatening people everywhere and uproot its destructive ideology.@@@In that regard, I recall the martyrs of Iraq who sacrificed their lives in defence of the values of freedom, justice, democracy and human rights.@@@During that just war, our Iraqi military forces acquired unique skills in fighting Da’esh, enforcing the rule of law and peacekeeping.@@@Iraq benefited from the expertise of our allies in the fight against terrorism.@@@I would like to reiterate our thanks and appreciation to them.@@@We also reiterate the call of the Government of the Republic of Iraq for continued confrontation of the phenomenon of international terrorism and the groups that back it.@@@Iraq looks forward to receiving more United Nations support for rebuilding the areas liberated and affected by the occupation of Da’esh terrorist gangs, and more United Nations aid for responding to urgent and necessary humanitarian needs in order to enhance Iraq’s capabilities and efforts to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure in a way that would help our cities and their people, including internally displaced persons, to return to normal life.@@@It is worth noting that the State’s ministries and institutions have pursued their efforts to help repatriate Iraqi families living in Al-Hol camp in Syria and to reintegrate them into their hometowns.@@@In that regard, I note that we have developed a comprehensive Government programme for the reconstruction of liberated areas, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the safe and voluntary return of displaced people.@@@We take this opportunity to express our profound thanks and appreciation to donor countries and international organizations for their humanitarian support and assistance to Iraq.@@@As I address the Assembly from this rostrum, I reiterate Iraq’s call on other countries not to use our territories under any pretext, be it combating terrorism or protecting their own national security, while endangering our security and stability.@@@Iraq stresses the need to respect the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the rules of international law and international relations, and to respect the sovereignty of States.@@@We therefore ask all States not to interfere in Iraqi territories and to respect the principle of good- neighbourliness, while promoting cooperative relations.@@@The Government of Iraq affirms its adherence to an approach that calls for resolving differences through diplomatic channels.@@@There is no doubt that Iraq, like the rest of the world, has been affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has impacted all aspects of life and proven that international cooperation and solidarity were successful in confronting it.@@@The Government of Iraq and its national institutions have taken the many preventive and curative measures necessary to control and curtail the pandemic and treat the infected.@@@I take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to those countries and international organizations, including the World Health Organization, for their role and sincere efforts in addressing the pandemic
and assisting developing countries in confronting and combating it.@@@Realizing the importance of national commitments, the protection of democratic experience and the people’s demands to democratically exercise their rights and freedom of expression, the Iraqi Government held free and fair elections with the support of the Security Council, the United Nations and other international organizations, which have all praised the integrity and high professionalism with which they were held.@@@I also want to thank all States and organizations that supported the elections.@@@In that regard, I want to thank the people who helped in holding the most successful of elections since 2003 until now, in particular Sayyid Al-Sistani, the Highest Marja’, for protecting the democratic process in Iraq.@@@Despite the success of the elections, the political forces could not agree on the formation of a new Government, leading to a political impasse.@@@My Government has called for a serious and transparent national dialogue among all political forces and various parties to discuss ways out of the current political crisis in an effort to form a Government that meets the people’s aspirations and hopes in achieving their goals and securing their future.@@@The Government of Iraq is working to build the State and maintain its stature on the basis of coexistence among all the constituents of the Iraqi people, while respecting diversity and ideological, religious and sectarian pluralism pursuant to the values and principles of justice and equality.@@@That can be done by ensuring the freedom of expression, the right to peaceful demonstration and human rights; strengthening law enforcement agencies and accountability measures; ending violations and subjecting perpetrators to accountability: achieving a State monopoly on arms; preventing the possession and use of arms outside the law and State institutions; investigating those who use them against citizens and members of the security forces; holding the perpetrators accountable according to the law; and applying justice to all.@@@Iraq is keen to be a source of regional and international stability.@@@Iraq seeks to bring together different viewpoints and endeavours to find sustainable peaceful solutions to regional crises and mend ties among the region’s countries by introducing a number of initiatives to ensure the protection of peace and security in our region, which has long suffered from senseless wars and crises.@@@The time has come to rebuild the region, pursuant to our era, history and balanced State policy.@@@Baghdad has hosted many meetings for the region’s countries.@@@It is a consequence of the balanced policy pursued by this Government and Iraqi diplomacy with a view to establishing moderation in the region and finding common grounds with neighbouring countries.@@@That will serve the interests of all parties and peoples of the region with historical and cultural ties, encourage regional cooperation and defuse crises.@@@The Baghdad Conference for Partnership and Cooperation, held in August 2021, witnessed a remarkable participation by regional neighbouring brotherly and friendly countries.@@@The Conference resulted in a number of important recommendations included in the communique of the Baghdad summit.@@@It is no secret to anyone that Iraq is enduring difficult climate conditions due to the scarcity of water resources, the change in course of rivers that Iraq shares with some neighbouring countries, and the implementation of projects without taking into account their effects on water quotas and fair use by riparian countries.@@@All of those conditions have come together and led Iraq to become the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, which has recently caused most of Iraq’s marshes to dry up and damaged the livelihoods of hundreds of rural families living there.@@@The marshes are natural reserves and listed as a World Heritage Site.@@@Those conditions have led to an increase in the rate of desertification and internal displacement due to nature and the loss of many family livelihoods, as well as a drop in the proportion of agricultural land.@@@Iraq calls on all regional countries to enter into a dialogue to resolve water issues, in accordance with international law and conventions.@@@Iraq is an oil-producing country that has participated in the progress and development of the global economy since the beginning of the twentieth century.@@@While Iraq suffers from climate change, it will also suffer from all the measures taken to address this phenomenon and the reduction in dependence on fossil fuels.@@@Nevertheless, my Government has worked on important strategic projects in clean energy, associated gas extraction and other areas related to the green economy.@@@That requires international support in various fields in order to back Iraq’s efforts and enable us to move forward in implementing national policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.@@@Similarly, we have not neglected the need to develop the education and culture sectors.@@@My Government has made the implementation of the 2030 national strategy for public and higher education a top priority.@@@The most important goals of the strategy are to achieve a 100 per cent school enrolment rate, upgrade the standards of public and higher education, develop educational techniques and technologies, and enhance skills in accordance with the job market and economic development.@@@We have also launched a national initiative for early childhood development that covers a period of 10 years with a view to reducing the illiteracy rate in our society and providing an appropriate educational environment for our children, especially since many sectors have suffered the repercussions of senseless wars, clashes and corruption, which have rocked the foundations of the educational sector in Iraq.@@@We have recently embarked on a campaign to build hundreds of schools in various Iraqi governorates that have suffered significant shortages in recent decades, in addition to facilitating the task of building universities and colleges in the country.@@@We stress Iraq’s steadfast position on the Palestinian question, all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and respect for the historical status of Jerusalem and its holy sites.@@@While we stress the need to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity and security, we support the holding of political talks among all Syrian parties.@@@We also support the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@Like other countries of the world, Iraq believes that regional crises and wars have consequences for all countries of the world.@@@We also believe that peoples always pay the price for such wars.@@@Wars impact all aspects of life, particularly energy supplies, food and security.@@@Iraq has faced many wars and is consequently sensitive to the issue.@@@We stress the need to find peaceful and sustainable solutions to regional and international crises through dialogue and to avoid the use of force.@@@We call for the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@The global economy and humankind must be saved from the repercussions of such wars.@@@In conclusion, the challenges facing my country, Iraq, today are but the result of the accumulation of political crises and conflicts over a long period.@@@We are working to defuse them, hoping that our society, which is made up mostly of young people, will adhere to and defend democracy as a way of life and a means of good governance.@@@Our nascent experience of democracy is still imbued with the spirit of courage and hope.@@@We are in dire need of understanding and support from the international community so that we can continue building a modern State, undertaking reconstruction, providing services and building the infrastructure that has been destroyed by senseless wars.@@@We believe in the need to invest in people and uphold their dignity while working to implement the Sustainable Development Goals in cooperation and comprehensive partnership with our neighbours in the region and the international community.@@@I bring to you the greetings of more than 1.3 billion people from the world’s largest democracy.@@@They join me in congratulating President Csaba Korosi on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@They follow closely developments at the United Nations, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of our existence.@@@We meet at a challenging time for the world order.@@@This session’s theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, seeks to capture its seriousness.@@@The year 2022 is an important milestone in India’s journey towards growth, development and prosperity.@@@India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, what we call “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”.@@@The story of that period has been one of the toil, determination, innovation and enterprise of millions of ordinary Indians.@@@They are rejuvenating a society pillaged by centuries of foreign attacks and colonialism, and they are doing so in a democratic framework, whose steady progress is reflected in more authentic voices and grounded leadership.@@@That new India, under the visionary and dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a confident and resurgent society.@@@Its agenda for our centenary will be achieved through the five pledges to which we committed ourselves on our independence day.@@@First, we are resolved to make India a developed country in the next 25 years.@@@For the world, that creates more capacities for global good.@@@Secondly, we will liberate ourselves from a colonial mindset.@@@Externally, that means reformed multilateralism and more contemporary global governance.@@@Thirdly, our rich civilizational heritage will be a source of pride and strength.@@@That includes care and concern for the environment, concepts which are so ingrained in our traditional ethos.@@@Fourthly, we will promote greater unity and solidarity.@@@That expresses a coming-together on global issues, such as terrorism, pandemics and the environment.@@@And fifthly, we will work to instil a consciousness of duties and responsibilities in both our citizens and the nation.@@@These five pledges affirm our age-old outlook that sees the world as one family.@@@We believe that national good and global good can be entirely in harmony.@@@It is this conviction that led us to supply vaccines to over a hundred nations.@@@Similarly, our evacuation operations in humanitarian-assistance and disaster- relief situations have always had room for other nationals in distress.@@@Even as we meet our own development targets, India offers partnerships to our brothers and sisters in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and we do so based on their needs and priorities.@@@Today, that focus is on green growth, better connectivity, digital delivery and accessible health.@@@Our solidarity is not just in words; it is evident in 700 projects across the world.@@@Even while India contributes to global betterment, we recognize the sharp deterioration in the international landscape.@@@The world is already struggling with challenges of post-pandemic economic recovery.@@@The debt situation of the developing world is precarious.@@@To this are now added the rising costs and shrinking availability of fuel, food and fertilizers.@@@These, along with trade disruptions and diversions, are among the many consequences of the Ukraine conflict.@@@The Indo-Pacific region also has fresh concerns about its stability and security, and climate events have added an overlay to these mounting anxieties.@@@As we saw in the case of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the South will be most affected, even if the immediate causes are well beyond its geographical location.@@@It is imperative that global conversations recognize this deep unfairness.@@@The inequity of vaccine distribution should not be replicated in other domains.@@@As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on.@@@And our answer, each time, is straight-forward and honest.@@@India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there.@@@We are on the side that respects the United Nations Charter and its founding principles.@@@We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out of conflict.@@@We are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet, even as they stare at escalating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers.@@@It is therefore in our collective interest to work constructively, both within the United Nations and outside it, to find an early resolution to this conflict.@@@While global attention has been on Ukraine, India has also had to contend with other challenges, especially in its own neighbourhood.@@@Some of them may be aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts, but they also speak to a deeper malaise.@@@The accumulation of debt in fragile economies is of particular concern.@@@We believe that in such times, the international community must rise above narrow national agendas.@@@For its part, India is taking exceptional measures in exceptional times.@@@We do so when we send 50,000 metric tons of wheat and multiple tranches of medicines and vaccines to Afghanistan; when we extend credits of $3.8 billion to Sri Lanka for fuel, essential commodities and trade settlement; when we supply 10,000 metric tons of food aid and vaccine shipments to Myanmar; when we fill the gap in humanitarian needs left unaddressed by political complexity.@@@Whether it is disaster response or humanitarian assistance, India has stood strong, contributing particularly to those nearest to us.@@@The world as we have known it is poised for transformational changes.@@@It has been affected in recent times by a succession of shocks, each of them significant.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic called into question the overcentralized nature of globalization and has led all of us to seek greater resilience in and reliability of supply chains.@@@The repercussions of the ongoing Ukraine conflict have further heightened economic stresses, especially on food and energy.@@@Climate events have added to the disruption that the world is already facing.@@@As for the promise of technology, it has certainly multiplied our capabilities but also added to vulnerabilities.@@@Trust and transparency are legitimate expectations of a more digitized world.@@@The quest to create a better global order would necessarily have to address all these issues.@@@Among them, some are clearly more existential in nature and necessitate intense coordination by the international community.@@@Climate action and climate justice are particularly noteworthy in this respect.@@@Working towards them, India has collaborated with partners on the International Solar Alliance, the One Sun, One World, One Grid initiative and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.@@@We stand ready to support any collective and equitable endeavour to protect our environment and further global wellness.@@@“Lifestyle for environment” or “LiFE”, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared on the sidelines of the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) in Glasgow, is our homage to Mother Nature.@@@India remains deeply committed to fighting climate change under the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.@@@We do so based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.@@@We have announced our updated nationally determined contributions after COP 26.@@@India’s steadfast commitment to South-South cooperation is by now well established and well recognized.@@@Our approach is based on principles of mutual respect and national ownership, with a commitment to sustainable development for all.@@@As we begin the Group of 20 (G-20) presidency this December, we are sensitive to the challenges faced by developing countries.@@@India will work with other G-20 members to address serious issues of debt, economic growth, food and energy security and particularly, the environment.@@@The reform of governance of multilateral financial institutions will continue to be one of our core priorities.@@@India will be completing its term as an elected member of the Security Council this year.@@@In our term, we have acted as a bridge on some serious but divisive issues confronting the Council.@@@We have also focused on such concerns as maritime security, peacekeeping and counter-terrorism.@@@Our contributions range from providing technology with a human touch to ensuring the safety and security of United Nations peacekeepers.@@@As the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee this year, India will be hosting its special meeting in Mumbai and New Delhi.@@@I invite all States Members of the United Nations to participate in it.@@@We need to create a global architecture that responds to the new tech tools deployed against open, diverse and pluralistic societies.@@@Having borne the brunt of cross-border terrorism for decades, India firmly advocates a zero-tolerance approach.@@@In our view, there is no justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivation.@@@And no rhetoric, however sanctimonious, can ever cover up blood stains.@@@The United Nations responds to terrorism by sanctioning its perpetrators.@@@Those who politicize the Security Council sanctions regime under resolution 1267 (1999), sometimes even to the extent of defending proclaimed terrorists, do so at their own peril.@@@Believe me, they advance neither their own interests nor, indeed, their reputation.@@@India has always espoused a cooperative, inclusive and consultative approach to international relations.@@@We believe that multipolarity, rebalancing, fair globalization and reformed multilateralism cannot be kept in abeyance.@@@The call for reformed multilateralism — with reforms of the Security Council at its core — enjoys considerable support among United Nations Members.@@@It does so because of the widespread recognition that the current architecture is anachronistic and ineffective.@@@It is also perceived as deeply unfair, denying entire continents and regions a voice in a forum that deliberates on their future.@@@India is prepared to take up greater responsibilities.@@@But it seeks, at the same time, to ensure that the injustice faced by the global South is decisively addressed.@@@We call for serious and sincere negotiations on this critical matter.@@@They must not be blocked by procedural tactics.@@@Naysayers cannot hold the intergovernmental negotiations process hostage in perpetuity.@@@In these turbulent times, it is essential that the world listen to more voices of reason and experience more acts of goodwill.@@@India is willing and able on both counts.@@@We believe that this is not an era of war or conflict.@@@On the contrary, it is a time for development and cooperation.@@@In the past, the Assembly has served as a meeting point of views and a catalyst for action.@@@It is vital that we continue to believe in the promise of diplomacy and the need for international cooperation.@@@Let us therefore strive to return to the course of seeking peace, progress and prosperity.@@@It is a great pleasure for me, on behalf of the people of Montenegro, to address the General Assembly today, just as it is always a pleasure to feel the cosmopolitan spirit of the annual high-level week at the United Nations.@@@At the outset, I would like to wish success to the new President of the General Assembly, Mr. Csaba Korosi, and say that I hope that his term will be very successful.@@@The world staggers from one crisis to the next, from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to yet another war, and today we are all concerned.@@@Montenegro’s position on the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine is that we stand with the people of Ukraine and strongly oppose the aggression, which is an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.@@@War is not the solution.@@@Aggression is not the solution.@@@Bombs are not the solution.@@@We come from a part of the world that knows well the cost of humanitarian and refugee crises stemming from ethnic conflict and the uselessness of raising armies against one another.@@@That is not the solution.@@@In the twenty-first century, humankind should be smarter than that.@@@We should not use war to resolve political problems.@@@That is not a solution.@@@We should sit together and engage in dialogue to consider the different political options.@@@States must find a way to engage in dialogue.@@@I know that that is not easy, but war is not the solution.@@@We will continue to support Ukraine.@@@We will do so permanently.@@@Our agenda is to follow European Union (EU) foreign policy to the letter, including sanctions against the Russia Federation.@@@It is not a question of economics; it is a question of principles and standards.@@@Today we have an aggression against Ukraine; tomorrow some other State could be attacked.@@@We need to find other solutions.@@@War has created a lot of problems.@@@In Montenegro, we have around 10,000 Ukrainian refugees.@@@For many of the countries represented in this Hall, that is not a huge number, but for Montenegro, a small country, it is almost to 2 per cent of the population.@@@As Montenegro’s Prime Minister, I am very proud to say that everyone in Montenegro feels very comfortable and very safe.@@@We will continue to open the door for people in trouble.@@@We will not say that they are not welcome.@@@They are welcome.@@@And with our relatively small capacity, we will support everything that upholds democratic standards and solidarity with our fellow human beings.@@@War produces a great many problems.@@@At this very moment, however, we are facing another crisis — an energy crisis — which may lead us to experience a very problematic winter in Europe.@@@We should understand one simple thing: today’s energy crisis will become tomorrow’s economic crisis, which will then, in turn, become a security crisis the day after tomorrow.@@@If we do not find a solution together with EU countries, we will be facing some very big problems.@@@Why are we facing an energy crisis?@@@It is not only because of war.@@@There are two factors that are driving the world’s current energy crisis, especially in Europe.@@@The first factor is the war in Ukraine, which is making a mess of the energy markets, triggering an increase in the price of every kind of energy, including electricity.@@@The second factor is climate change.@@@Today in Europe, we have rivers that are at their lowest levels.@@@We have lakes that are also at their lowest levels.@@@And it is at the United Nations that we must engage in solving this problem for the future.@@@We are therefore experiencing an energy crisis, but it is not just because of the war.@@@War is a key factor, but it is a secondary factor.@@@The main factor is climate change.@@@We need to protect the environment for future generations.@@@I want to talk about the environment because I come from a State that, in its Constitution, is dedicated to being an ecological State.@@@We are the only State in the world whose Constitution declares it to be an ecological State, and I am more than sure that constitutions in future will be written with ecological provisions designed to protect the environment.@@@We want to build our country as a green destination.@@@I am very proud to say that we can still drink water from rivers in the north of my country.@@@It is crucial that we protect nature, undertake green projects, find solutions to the problem of pollution and everything else that destroys nature.@@@I agree with those who say that we need to take greater care.@@@This is not a question for one country alone.@@@We need to act with unity and solidarity in this, or we will worsen the problem.@@@Green projects and the protection of the environment are items high on Montenegro’s agenda.@@@We hope that together with other countries we will find a productive and sustainable solution for the future.@@@Another important issue for us is transitional justice, which has been with us in the Western Balkans for many years.@@@Members know that we had a major conflict in the past, and that, since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, there has been a great deal of fighting over ethnic and religious problems.@@@Today we are trying to build a modern European society, but we cannot do that if we are still dealing with transitional justice.@@@There are two types of peace: positive peace and negative peace.@@@Negative peace is when there is absence of conflict, but institutions are weak, politicized, unprofessional and controlled by corrupt leaders.@@@That is negative peace.@@@We want to see more positive peace in the region.@@@Positive peace stems from independent institutions, an independent judiciary and efforts to fight against organized crime and corruption, especially corrupt leaders who promote nationalism and conflict in the region because they want to maintain the regional status quo and foreclose the possibility of new leaders coming to power to make changes in the country or in the region.@@@Positive peace is something what we want to fight for.@@@It is the way that we can end the period of transitional justice.@@@It is how we can look at and deal with what happened in the past.@@@Without pursuing that, we will not have the truth, and without truth we will not have reconciliation.@@@Our country is in this Hall to promote reconciliation.@@@Our country is in this Hall to shake hands with representatives of every country in the world that seeks to be grounded in universal principles.@@@The people of Montenegro want justice.@@@I believe that the people of many countries represented in this Hall want to see more justice globally and more justice locally.@@@We are very proud of our very inclusive multicultural society.@@@It is true that our country has had problems, but we try to solve them in the right way.@@@Everyone is more than welcome in Montenegro.@@@We need to move forward by promoting, just as members of the Human Rights Council do, human rights everywhere, inclusive open societies, for the sake of every nation, ethnicity, religion, and individual.@@@We are proud of our diversity.@@@We promote diversity.@@@Diversity is good for every society.@@@It is good to see the cosmopolitan spirit in New York these days.@@@We want to have that kind of society.@@@We want to promote more media freedom.@@@We want to condemn people who are against media freedom.@@@In our country, we are still investigating the killing of some well-known journalists that took place 20 years ago.@@@We are not proud of that.@@@We want to have institutions that can fix the problem and punish people who attack the media.@@@Media freedom is an important part of democracy.@@@In our country we should do more about that.@@@We should promote freedom of media and every kind of every kind of freedom.@@@I am very proud of the Government of Montenegro’s in fighting organized crime and promoting justice in this most recent period.@@@Why do I mention this now?@@@I do so because it is not only Montenegro’s problem.@@@I refer in this regard to high-level corruption, namely, cigarette smuggling and cocaine smuggling.@@@Some 20 per cent of all cigarettes smuggled in EU countries go through Montenegro.@@@We are the country which, in the last six months, seized 149,000 cartons of cigarettes, worth more than $120 million on the market.@@@That is the biggest action against cigarette smuggling in all of Europe.@@@Last year we undertook a similar action against cocaine smuggling.@@@That cocaine was not sold in Montenegro because Montenegro has 600,000 people; it is cocaine for sale in Western Europe.@@@These results show very clearly the Government’s orientation as well as that of the State and the people of Montenegro: we no longer wish to have organized crime or corruption in our country.@@@We are ready to commit to that, and we invite the General Assembly and the rest of the United Nations, as well as other partners, to support us, because it is a transnational problem.@@@It is not the problem of only one country.@@@We will continue these efforts with our international partners and with States that provide us with a lot of information.@@@But it is important to understand that behind nationalism in the region hides corruption.@@@Again, behind nationalism in the Western Balkans lies corruption.@@@Fighting against corruption will fight nationalism.@@@The less corruption there is, the less nationalism there will be; the less corruption there is, the less tension there will be.@@@With less corruption, we can focus on the economy and on progress.@@@With current levels of corruption, our attention will always be focused on the past.@@@We cannot change the past.@@@The only thing we can change is the future.@@@Our common strategy should be to change the future in the right way.@@@With regard to Montenegro’s foreign policy, I would like to underline two very important points.@@@We are full members of NATO.@@@We made a very good decision in 2017 to join NATO.@@@Now, in a period of crisis, when we see that such countries as Sweden and Finland are joining NATO, everybody in Montenegro understands why our joining was so important.@@@Another one of our goals — and this is bigger than NATO membership — is to join the EU.@@@We want to be part of the big European family.@@@For small countries like Montenegro, it is very important to be in the democratic countries club.@@@We want to be the next member of the EU.@@@We are dedicated to doing everything we must do to find the solution to joining the EU as soon as possible.@@@The Western Balkans should not be the black hole of Europe.@@@The Western Balkans can make great contributions to Europe and to the world, with its culture, diversity, people — with everything they have to offer
And it is very important to understand that we are not alone.@@@I am more than sure that we are not alone, but we need first to finish with our internal Montenegrin issues, and we are really ready to do that.@@@It is very important for us to have regional cooperation and for us to support regional initiatives.@@@All regional initiatives that bring greater focus on the economy and on progress are welcome in our country.@@@We want to see people who had problems with each other in the past to sit together and discuss these projects.@@@We are really proud to be the positive case in the region.@@@We are the country that builds bridges between other countries.@@@We continue to be ready to play that role in the coming period.@@@We want to see how Serbia and Kosovo find common agreement.@@@We want to see how our neighbour Bosnia and Herzegovina finds internal agreement with itself.@@@We want to see all of its six States of the Balkans form a productive Balkans region.@@@Every inclusive initiative is more than welcome for our country.@@@We cannot feel comfortable if we are successful and our neighbours are not.@@@We want to be successful together.@@@We want to see every single country — not just in the region, but in the world — succeed.@@@This is the politics of a small country called Montenegro.@@@We want to promote peace.@@@Our wish is to promote peace.@@@Our wish is to promote stability and progress.@@@I think that the opportunity afforded us in these five or six days in New York is the future.@@@We understand that deglobalization — a concept that got its start a few years ago — is not sustainable.@@@Every problem of every country can very easily be the problem of another country.@@@That is why we should talk, why we should find solutions together, why we need to promote more unity everywhere.@@@In our country, the world will always find a partner for good initiatives.@@@For everything that brings peace, progress and stability, we are ready to participate.@@@We will be found in the General Assembly with every country in the world that wishes to promote the same values.@@@We need to promote more ethics in global politics and less populism.@@@We need to promote more concrete action and less rhetoric.@@@We need to promote more justice and less support for authoritarian regimes around the globe.@@@Our duty is to give our best so that democracy may survive.@@@Democracy should be more functional, and we should stick together.@@@A globalized world is like a village.@@@Nobody can say that this is not important for me personally.@@@We are in this Hall to discuss and understand that everyone is important.@@@The size of the population of a country or the territory of a country is irrelevant.@@@Everyone is important.@@@Every voice is important.@@@We need to advocate democracy.@@@We need to advocate universal values.@@@This is how we can make the world a better place for all of us.@@@I am grateful for this opportunity to address the General Assembly, and on behalf of the people of Montenegro, I wish all members the greatest success in each of their countries.@@@At the outset, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi and his country, Hungary, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I am certain that this organ will benefit greatly from the wealth of knowledge and experience he has acquired during his illustrious career in the diplomatic service, including his term here in New York as Hungary’s Permanent Representative, when he co-chaired the intergovernmental process and ushered in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@I must particularly express gratitude to the outgoing President for his close coordination and collaboration with other principal organs, particularly the Economic and Social Council, which Botswana was honoured to lead as its seventy-seventh President.@@@I am delighted that the two Presidents worked very cooperatively on addressing vaccine equity, the sustainable development of Africa, financing for sustainable recovery and the nexus between natural resources and sustainable development, among other priorities.@@@Close collaboration among principal organs of the United Nations is beneficial and must be promoted.@@@Botswana endorses Mr. Korosi’s choice of the theme for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@We concur with his observation that the current global challenges —namely, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the war in Ukraine, humanitarian challenges and climate change — are complex and interconnected and hence require transformative solutions.@@@Given the interconnectedness of those challenges, it is evident that they can be effectively addressed only with a holistic approach.@@@That further demonstrates the enduring relevance of the Charter of the United Nations, which 77 years ago established the three founding pillars of the United Nations system — human rights, peace and security, and development — as interrelated and mutually reinforcing.@@@As United Nations Member States, we should look no further for those solutions than in the already existing key multilateral frameworks, among them the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1), as well as the outcomes of major United Nations meetings.@@@This session gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to those solutions.@@@In his comprehensive report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), the Secretary-General has offered us a boost with concrete ideas and recommendations to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to close the existing gaps in our multilateral frameworks.@@@I wish therefore to preface my remarks, through which I will share my country’s progress in recovering from COVID-19 and moving towards a transformative and sustainable development, by reminding the Assembly of Botswana’s road to development.@@@Many in this Hall may only know the Botswana of now, which is an upper-middle-income country.@@@That is a status that we are proud of, given that when we attained our independence, only 56 years ago, we were among the poorest in the world.@@@However, we were fortunate to discover what has turned out to be the world’s largest diamond reserve across the Kimberley Belt.@@@For those less acquainted with the development path we have travelled as a country, that is not the entire reflection of the Botswana story.@@@Our story is based on the humanity, principles and tenacity that we have as a people, as Botswana.@@@It is a story of the wisdom of our forefathers, who avoided the misfortune that often accompanied the discovery and exploitation of minerals in other parts of the world and elected instead to turn the discovery of diamonds into a story for development.@@@Botswana is a nation that would never have been able to realize its development had we not held firmly to our belief in the principles of democracy, centred on the rule of law, good governance and the protection and enjoyment of basic human rights by our people.@@@However, I must admit that we face an uphill battle in our investment efforts to attract investors to help us diversify our economy away from dependence on diamonds.@@@I have stood before the General Assembly and I have engaged in different forums, when the opportunity arises, to share the Botswana story with a view to encouraging partnerships to augment our efforts towards diversification.@@@I trust that those who are attentive to our call are more in number, and I firmly believe that they, too, aspire to share a part of our story.@@@In the meantime, diamonds are still the bedrock of our economy.@@@It is in that respect that the words of
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the call for a common agenda resonate with me.@@@I like in particular the call by the Secretary-General for a global view whereby power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level.@@@For my country, that translates into a fair and equitable opportunity to use the resources that we have to develop our people and give them an equal opportunity to contribute and share in global wealth.@@@As we continue to advocate for the Kimberley Process, I wish to remind the Assembly that Botswana’s story is unquestionable proof and living testimony that diamonds, with good governance, are for development.@@@In fact, diamonds are a serious matter of livelihoods.@@@I will be hosting a side event on diamonds for development later this evening, through which I hope to further broaden conversations and allow our partners within the United Nations, Governments, civil society and the private sector to join us in ensuring that my country, Botswana, will also be part of the United Nations family, espoused around shared power, wealth and opportunity, as we endeavour to realize the 2030 Agenda.@@@Despite our challenges, my Government continues to play its part in contributing to the international agenda and ensuring that our peoples’ access to medicines is part and parcel of their health care, while ensuring that the economy also recovers from the pandemic.@@@Vaccine roll-out remains a precondition for a sustainable recovery, yet many countries in the global South, especially in Africa, have not met the World Health Organization target of full vaccination of 70 per cent of the population by mid-2022.@@@That underscores the urgent need to continue promoting vaccine equity through international solidarity and addressing vaccine hesitancy by countering disinformation and raising awareness about the science-backed facts regarding the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines.@@@Despite the challenges that we have encountered, which are common to many developing countries, Botswana has procured enough vaccines to administer to all eligible groups, thus enabling significant progress, with 64 per cent of our population now fully vaccinated.@@@However, much more needs to be done.@@@It is in that context that Botswana continues to play an active role in that matter and recently also joined other Member States in co-sponsoring resolution 76/301, calling for the convening of a high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response during the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@We also continue to actively participate in the ongoing process towards a possible elaboration of a pandemic treaty at the World Health Organization in Geneva.@@@We believe that such a legally binding instrument would strengthen existing global mechanisms to address and react more speedily to health emergencies.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, as part of overcoming the challenges of global vaccine inequity and in line with our commitment to building back better and in a transformative manner, the Government of Botswana has approved the manufacturing of the patent-free CorbeVax COVID-19 vaccine and that the construction of a vaccine manufacturing plant has already commenced.@@@Additionally, the facility will produce cancer treatment and next-generation, cell- based immunotherapy.@@@Those initiatives have been undertaken in partnership with NantWorks, Texas Children’s Hospital Centre for Vaccine Development and Baylor College of Medicine.@@@That partnership will enhance Botswana’s capacity in human vaccine production, contribute to our goal of building a knowledge-based economy and help in preparations for future pandemics.@@@Botswana’s recovery plans include strengthening the country’s vast social protection system to ensure the inclusivity of vulnerable groups, including persons living with disabilities.@@@That will go a long way towards facilitating equal enjoyment of their rights while broadening the accountability framework as we recently acceded to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.@@@In that regard, my Government has set a medium- to long-term economic recovery and transformation plan intended to fast track recovery efforts while advancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its goals.@@@In order to achieve sustainable development, adequate financing is needed for the success of our recovery efforts from the pandemic and acceleration of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda during this Decade of Action.@@@The effective mobilization of domestic and international financial resources, as well as their prudent utilization, are therefore imperative.@@@I therefore reiterate calls on development partners to scale up and fulfil our official development assistance commitments and our efforts to attain long-term development sustainability.@@@In addition to international funding, it should be noted that transformative agendas require the effective implementation by Governments and associated stakeholders, as well as a sense of ownership on the
part of all stakeholders and a buy-in from the people we serve.@@@This decisive moment of the myriad challenges we face demands that we challenge ourselves even more.@@@My Government has thus initiated its recent agenda, inspired by the need for collective, inclusive and coordinated efforts towards the transformative agenda.@@@We are accelerating digitalization in the delivery of services, driven by innovation and creativity.@@@Our people are responding to the technology-driven solutions and they, too, are demonstrating the reorientation of their disposition, as well as conceptual agility to venture into new frontiers of doing things differently.@@@A full embrace of this mindset change is an inspirational approach to the effective implementation of Government policies, programmes, projects, business activities and, indeed, the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The realization of transformative solutions to the current social and economic challenges will require solidarity, both within and among countries.@@@As Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, many of which are also characterized as least-developed and small States, Botswana expresses solidarity with fellow United Nations Member States in special situations, particularly the distinct and peculiar challenges faced by the least developed countries and the small island developing States in their efforts to build back better and recover sustainably from the pandemic.@@@In line with the repeated position of our subregional body, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), I also wish to express solidarity with our northeastern neighbour, Zimbabwe, and call for the removal of unilateral coercive measures targeted at that country.@@@While we are confident of the resilience and resolve of Zimbabwe and its economic transformation prospects, we are concerned that such measures are not advancing the cause of livelihoods of innocent Zimbabweans or the cause of our SDGs.@@@This year, we continue to witness extreme weather events that point to the escalating severity of the climate crisis.@@@The decisive implementation of the bold climate action spelled out in the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact is therefore needed to prevent the worst implications.@@@Botswana remains committed to our 15-per cent carbon emissions reduction target by 2030, as indicated in our nationally determined contributions and reconfirmed in our climate change policy, adopted in 2021.@@@The policy addresses access to climate finance, clean technologies and renewable energy.@@@Climate ambitions will not translate into climate action in developing countries if they remain inadequately funded.@@@We are therefore pleased that new financial pledges to support adaptation in developing countries were made at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) in Glasgow, United Kingdom.@@@It is our hope that these commitments will be fulfilled expeditiously in order to enable accelerated implementation, particularly in Africa, a region that contributes minimally to climate change but is, regrettably, the most affected.@@@In that context, we are optimistic that COP27, to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on African soil, will further inspire ambitious climate action and deliver more adaptation resources for Africa and other vulnerable regions.@@@Drawing on that inspiration, Botswana, in collaboration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and various stakeholders, convened a climate adaptation week 2022 from 22 to 26 August in Gaborone, under the theme “Transformations in Advancing the Formulations and Implementation of National Adaptation Plans”.@@@The expo succeeded in promoting the exchange of experiences and fostering partnerships among a wide range of actors and stakeholders on how to advance national adaptation plans.@@@On 2 March, Botswana was among the 141 Member States that voted in favour of resolution ES- 11/1, demanding an end to the invasion of Ukraine.@@@With that vote, we were reaffirming the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, particularly its Articles 1 and 2, which underscore the need for peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@The Charter is a binding instrument of international law; therefore, all peace-loving nations ought to adhere to its letter and spirit under all circumstances.@@@We therefore continue to call on all parties to recommit to finding peaceful and lasting solutions to the conflict through diplomacy and dialogue.@@@The United Nations-brokered talks that resulted in the Russian Federation and Ukraine signing an agreement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative are a testament to the fact that, when given a chance, diplomacy and dialogue can yield results.@@@If nothing else, the end of the Second World War and the founding of the United Nations in 1945 demonstrated that only if we approach conflict based on solidarity and working together can we find peace.@@@I commend the Secretary-General and the United Nations system organizations, Tiirkiye and other stakeholders, including such neighbouring countries as Poland, for rising to the challenges to address humanitarian needs in Ukraine and other crisis situations.@@@As we continue to seek an amicable redress of this warring conflict, it is important that the United Nations system be particularly adequately resourced, given its critical work of saving lives and alleviating the suffering of victims of armed conflict, climate change and other disasters.@@@We, the collective States Members of the United Nations, have the responsibility and mandate to strengthen international law, promote human rights and gender equality and, most crucial, to protect civilians in challenging peacekeeping environments.@@@In that context, Botswana shares the same ideals with many States represented here today on the principle of the responsibility to protect.@@@As already acknowledged at the 2005 World Summit, States have the primary responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.@@@As part of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, Botswana as co-Chair, together with Costa Rica and Denmark, and will continue to ensure that the membership of the United Nations pays attention to this important responsibility to reinforce global action.@@@In southern Africa, we remain actively engaged through our subregional organization, SADC, in addressing the threat posed by terrorism and violent extremism to peace and security in our subregion.@@@To that end, SADC has deployed its security forces to thwart terrorist threats in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique.@@@The United Nations response to today’s crises is a clear demonstration of its indispensability as the foremost organization in addressing global issues.@@@From its system-wide response to COVID-19 to its swift action in relation to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and other crisis situations, the United Nations has proven to be fit for purpose.@@@Nonetheless, there remains ample room for improving the Organization’s effectiveness in fulfilling the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.@@@In that connection, we welcome recent reforms and proposals aimed at strengthening the United Nations system and enhancing its relevance in addressing contemporary challenges.@@@These efforts include the Secretary-General’s development management, peace and security, human rights and humanitarian pillar reforms, which are aimed at enhancing the Secretariat’s ability, agility, accountability and effectiveness in mandate implementation.@@@For a small country like mine, the reform of the United Nations is important only insofar as it ensures the equal voice of Member States, regardless of their size.@@@My Government and I personally are therefore eager to have our own people represented and employed within the United Nations system.@@@With our presidency of the Economic and Social Council, I believe that Botswana has demonstrated its ability, including the capacity of our youth, who have received positive reviews for their support to the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Council during our tenure.@@@We are, however, eager to see such accolades turning into real opportunities for absorption through other employment opportunities and in the hierarchy of the Organization, particularly for our youth.@@@As I conclude my remarks, let me reassure the President that he can count on Botswana’s support and constructive engagement towards a successful implementation of the programme of work of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I hope that Botswana can also rely on the United Nations system and our development partners and the wider international community to help us realize the 2030 Agenda and transform our people and country into a developed nation by 2036.@@@It is my distinct honour to address the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session today on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan.@@@I wish to congratulate the President, His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary, on being chosen to lead the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@The Government of South Sudan welcomes his motto,
“Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”.@@@We stand in support of sustainable policies and positive social transformations.@@@We commend the Secretary-General for convening the Transforming Education Summit, which successfully concluded this week.@@@I am pleased to report that South Sudan is committed to transforming its education system by increasing its budgetary allocation for education to 17.5 per cent of the national budget.@@@This investment in education will enable us to build more schools and improve teachers’ pay and thereby put the country on track to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 by 2030.@@@The Revitalized Peace Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, signed on 12 September 2018 between the Government and opposition groups, ended the internal conflict in South Sudan.@@@The parties are committed to the implementation of the Peace Agreement, which has improved security in the country.@@@Thanks to the relative peace, internally displaced persons and refugees have been voluntarily returning home, although more formal reintegration remains a challenge, owing to limited resources.@@@Nevertheless, the Government is doing whatever it can to resettle the internally displaced and refugees.@@@On the same note, I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that the command structure of the national unified forces has been established.@@@This is a major leap towards transformation and regularization of the forces.@@@Since the unification of the command structure in April 2022, there has been a de-escalation in clashes between the South Sudan Peoples’ Defence Forces and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition.@@@In addition, the first batch of 53,000 national unified force personnel successfully graduated on 30 August 2022.@@@I am equally pleased to inform the Assembly that the parties to the Peace Agreement have agreed on a road map to complete the remaining tasks in the Agreement, which will pave the way for peaceful, fair and credible elections at the end of the transitional period in 2025.@@@Through thoughtful and targeted actions, South Sudan has been able to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).@@@The health effects of the pandemic in South Sudan have been surprisingly less pronounced than expected, marked by very low morbidity and fatality rates.@@@As of 9 May 2022, only 17,513 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which includes 138 deaths, were reported since the start of the pandemic.@@@The current vaccination campaign continues to be effective, with the coverage of 45 per cent of the entire population over the age of 18.@@@Despite this positive health news, the pandemic has had negative effects on the economy, starting with dramatic declines in domestic production and revenue collection, followed by a rising cost of living.@@@These economic consequences are far-reaching, severely weakening, for example, human-capital formation, especially in education, as the lockdown deprived school-age children of learning opportunities.@@@In April 2016, South Sudan ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, which seeks to solidify a global response to the threat of climate change by keeping global warming to well below 2°C.@@@South Sudan has strategized to build on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure and to foster socioeconomic recovery pathways centred on climate change and natural disasters.@@@It recently became evident to us that climate change is real, with the impacts of climate change and global warming now manifesting in various part of South Sudan.@@@For example, 70 to 80 per cent of South Sudan has been affected by floods for the last three years in a row.@@@In its analysis of food insecurity between the periods of February to March 2022, the Government of South Sudan estimated that 6.83 million people — 55.3 per cent of the population — are facing acute food insecurity.@@@Some 2.37 million people are in a state of emergency.@@@The severe food insecurity is worsened by the combination of added shocks, including flooding, prolonged drought, physical insecurity and the effects of COVID-19.@@@South Sudan is surrounded by countries afflicted by conflict.@@@As part of its obligation to promote peace and stability in the region and beyond, South Sudan successfully played a mediating role in the armed conflict in the Sudan, which resulted into the signing of Juba Peace Agreement in 2020.@@@South Sudan stands ready to mediate in the current conflict between the Sudanese Army and the Forces of Freedom and Change in the Sudan so that the country can finally enjoy lasting peace.@@@Recently, South Sudan also offered to mediate to resolve the tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over their disagreement on the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.@@@We further demonstrated willingness to mediate in the internal conflict in Ethiopia between the Ethiopian Government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front.@@@Furthermore, the Republic of South Sudan made itself available to play a mediating role on the border issue between the
Republic of the Sudan and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.@@@By participating in efforts to bring about regional peace and stability, South Sudan has demonstrated its reliability as a partner in the quest for regional and international peace and security.@@@Furthermore, the Republic of South Sudan is contributing a battalion of peacekeeping forces to the Eastern Africa Standby Force seeking to bring peace to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@The current war between Russia and Ukraine is very unfortunate and devastating to the lives and livelihood of the citizens of both countries and beyond.@@@The war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis where millions are in dire need.@@@This war has not only affected the two warring parties, but it has had far-reaching effects on the global economy.@@@From the moral point of view, the Government of South Sudan calls on Russia and Ukraine to cease all forms of hostilities and resolve the dispute through diplomatic and constructive dialogue so as to avert further consequences.@@@The Government of South Sudan appreciates the critical humanitarian and technical support made by States Members of the United Nations, and it looks forward to that support continuing.@@@To mitigate the effects of flooding on the population and their livelihoods, South Sudan is donating $10 million to the World Food Programme to alleviate the suffering of the affected displaced communities.@@@However, we need the support of the international community to reach all the flood- and drought-affected areas and communities.@@@The President of the Republic of South Sudan will convene a conference of all the humanitarian organizations in South Sudan to coordinate humanitarian activities.@@@The Government of South Sudan is committed to providing security and protection to relief workers.@@@Together, we can save our planet by playing our roles and by supporting each other to mitigate the effects of climate change and come up with alternative methods and solutions based on available protocols.@@@Finally, the implementation process of the Revitalized Peace Agreement is facing numerous challenges, and sanctions imposed by international partners on individuals and entities are a disservice to the process.@@@As we make progress in the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, we call upon the international community — and the United Nations in particular — to revise the individual and targeted sanctions and the arms embargo imposed on my country, in order to enable the successful completion of the remaining provisions of the Peace Agreement outlined in the new road map.@@@Growing up in Europe as a child of the Cold War, the Iron Curtain was a fact of life, and I still vividly remember when the first breaches began to appear in the mid-1980s.@@@The credit for that shift, which made a profound impression, is largely due to Mikhail Gorbachev, who passed away a few weeks ago.@@@Although he represented a dogmatic, undemocratic and oppressive system, he had the courage, as a matter of principle, to choose freedom and humanity.@@@I mention that memory here for a reason.@@@As Russia’s recent past and Mr. Gorbachev’s legacy have shown, we will always have a choice to make.@@@It is the choice between “might is right” and, in the words of the great Dag Hammarskjold, “an international community living in peace under the laws of justice” (A/PV.690, para. 68).@@@That is my message today — working together under the laws of justice is and will remain the only path to a safe and prosperous world.@@@And that is why Russia’s aggression must be stopped.@@@Right now, Russia stands on the wrong side of history.@@@It is hard not to think of historical analogies in which one powerful country with expansionist ambitions invaded other countries under the false pretence of victimhood and security.@@@Let me be very clear.@@@Russia is not the victim here, it is the aggressor, and the whole world knows it.@@@No one was invading Russia.@@@No one was threatening the Russian people.@@@The people of Ukraine wanted only to be left in peace and to decide their own future.@@@Again, there is only one aggressor here, and that is Russia.@@@For too long, we assumed that it was pure rhetoric when Mr. Putin said that the end of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe.@@@In hindsight, we all should have paid heed to his words, because they reflect a dangerous worldview.@@@He will not stop at Ukraine if we do not stop him now.@@@This war is bigger than Ukraine itself.@@@It is about upholding the international rule of law.@@@It is about a sovereign people’s right to choose its own path.@@@It is about freedom — theirs and ours.@@@This war is therefore about our common future.@@@And there is only one path for us to follow and one right choice to make.@@@We must uphold the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations — the principles we
agreed to after the painful lessons of history learned from a past aggressor.@@@This year, NATO and European Union allies are more united than ever in our determination to stop Putin.@@@All States Members of the United Nations should be united in condemning this unprovoked war, because Russia’s unbridled aggression is an assault on the Charter and the international rules-based order.@@@It is an assault on the very foundations of our partnership and therefore an assault on the security of us all.@@@The Ukrainian people are fighting for their freedom, one stride at a time.@@@I have great admiration for Ukraine’s achievements on the battlefield.@@@Ukraine is gaining ground.@@@This shows that our military assistance is working, and it motivates us to do even more.@@@In the past week, Putin made a speech that can only be described as a sign of panic — a sign of weakness.@@@He is losing his own ill-conceived war, and he knows it.@@@That is why he clutches to his delusional narrative, full of lies and deceit.@@@His words were meant to intimidate, but they leave us cold.@@@Putin’s latest threats to invoke Russia’s nuclear capabilities are intended to sow division in the growing unity that the world is showing.@@@But he will not succeed.@@@Together with our allies, the Netherlands will continue to support Ukraine in any way we can and for however long it takes, every inch of the way.@@@I therefore call on everyone here — all States Members of the United Nations — to stand firm in defence of the principles we collectively enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to stand firm until peace, freedom and territorial integrity are fully restored in Ukraine.@@@That must be followed by rebuilding the country and achieving justice for those who have suffered from the war and the crimes and human rights violations arising from it, from sexual violence to deportations, torture and random killings.@@@The horrific crimes committed in Bucha, which I visited, and other places must not go unpunished.@@@I reiterate that the empty Russian threats leave us cold.@@@But what does not leave us cold is the suffering of the people of Ukraine and, frankly, also the suffering of Russian people, who are being called up against their will to fight.@@@Every week we are seeing more evidence of atrocities, such as those in the recently liberated city of Izyum.@@@The world cannot and will not stand by and do nothing.@@@There can be no justice without accountability.@@@The Netherlands and the city of The Hague — the legal capital of the world — feel a special responsibility in that regard.@@@We have already supported fact-finding missions by sending forensic experts to Ukraine, in close cooperation with the International Criminal Court.@@@And in July we hosted the Ukraine Accountability Conference, at which 45 countries agreed on key priorities for guaranteeing justice for Ukraine.@@@We know from experience that achieving international justice can be a long and painstaking process.@@@For more than eight years now, we have been closing in on the Russians responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine.@@@I am grateful for the unwavering support we have received from Ukraine and many other countries in our fight for justice for the 298 victims and their families.@@@I promise the General Assembly that the Netherlands will continue to work hard to ensure justice for Ukraine as well.@@@By the same token, we stand firmly with those in Russia who oppose the war, who long for peace and justice, who do not want to send their children into a senseless war and whose voices are not being heard.@@@We will also support those people all over the world who are suffering the effects of the war indirectly.@@@Putin’s war has created not only thousands of victims in Ukraine, but also hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of victims of hunger and poverty around the world.@@@Here too, the United Nations family must hold Russia to account.@@@Putin’s cold-blooded power politics, which exploit the most basic human needs of so many people, provide yet another argument for ending the fossil fuel era even faster than we had planned.@@@They make tackling that other major global issue — climate change — even more urgent.@@@Here too, worldwide cooperation is an absolute must.@@@Together we have all made pledges aimed at keeping global warming below 1.5°C.@@@Around the world, we all feel the urgency of that task.@@@The Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is made up of four very different countries, is also feeling the effects of climate change, from heavier rainfall and worsening drought in the European part of the Kingdom to more severe hurricanes and rising sea levels in the Caribbean part.@@@Small island developing States are at the forefront of the world’s climate adaptation strategies, and Curasao, Aruba and St. Maarten, the island countries of our Kingdom, are no exception.@@@We are experiencing both the challenges confronting mainland Europe and those that small island States face
every day, including rising ocean temperatures, coral bleaching, biodiversity loss and ocean pollution.@@@As one Kingdom, we know that water is the factor linking all the great challenges of our time, from food and energy to migration and urbanization.@@@Moreover, 90 per cent of all climate disasters manifest themselves through water via flooding, drought or pollution.@@@Many parts of the world are already facing the reality of having too much or too little water or water supplies that are too polluted.@@@The recent events in Pakistan are a sobering reminder of that: devastating floods that have disrupted the lives of more than 30 million people.@@@That illustrates once again that water is at the heart of many global problems.@@@It has the power to turn our lives upside down and to threaten our health, safety, food and living environments.@@@But at the same time, collaborating on water issues provides us with a big opportunity to make the world safer, healthier and more prosperous.@@@Investing in water security should be a top priority for our common future because worldwide water solutions are an existential issue and therefore a basic necessity for the world.@@@It is our responsibility to place water security at the core of all our climate action and worldwide efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@That is why the Kingdom of the Netherlands, together with our friends from Tajikistan, will be hosting next year’s United Nations Water Conference.@@@The Conference is all about action — action by Governments and the private sector, working closely across sectors and regions.@@@It can and must be a turning point — it is now or never.@@@I therefore urge everyone to attend.@@@In the meantime, we will also need to step up our other climate efforts.@@@We will have to rapidly deliver on the promises we made last year in Glasgow.@@@The twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, will be another milestone, if only because it will mark the first time it will be convened on the African continent.@@@Earlier this month, I met with African leaders in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, at the Africa adaptation summit.@@@Our discussions further impressed on me the importance of climate action for Africa.@@@I can confidently say that the European Union member States remain fully committed to a 55 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a swift transition to clean energy.@@@The Netherlands is also working to combat deforestation and to help the world meet its $100 billion pledge on climate finance.@@@That money must go to the most vulnerable individuals and communities — to those hit hardest by climate change.@@@We will continue to provide expertise and financial support to protect vulnerable areas from the elements.@@@Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing countries take the necessary measures.@@@Only by acting together can we turn things around.@@@That is why the Netherlands will continue pressing for a doubling of finance for climate adaptation.@@@Half of the money that my country spends on international climate action now goes to adaptation and resilience, and we will continue on that path, because adaptation is in our DNA.@@@In order to address the major issues of our time, we need each other more than ever.@@@Cooperation is the only way forward, with the United Nations as a vital tool — one we must use far more effectively.@@@To quote Dag Hammarskjold once more:
“The United Nations is what the Members make it, reflecting the weakness of all human effort but also the high aspirations and noble achievements of men of good will all over the world.”@@@That is why the Netherlands supports Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a framework for promoting peace, security and sustainable development.@@@We will continue working every day to build broad coalitions to address the major issues of our time — coalitions in which water is our common bond.@@@In conclusion, together we can and must defend, protect and reinforce the international rules-based order.@@@Putin’s war of aggression must be stopped.@@@We cannot go back to an age of imperialist wars, mass atrocities and mass graves.@@@I want to tell those who are still on the fence that they have a choice.@@@Now is the time to speak out.@@@Now is the time to be on the right side of history.@@@At the outset, I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish him every success in his tasks.@@@I also thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts during his presidency of the Assembly at its previous session.@@@I commend the outstanding work of the Secretary-General to optimize the efficiency of the United Nations institutions to achieve the purposes of its Charter.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and its tireless support for the principles of international legitimacy aimed at maintaining international peace and security.@@@It pledges to cooperate on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States, to resolve disputes through peaceful means and to abstain from threatening or using force.@@@My country participated in establishing the United Nations and signing the San Francisco Charter, based on the teachings of our true Islamic religion and genuine Arab traditions of justice, charity, cooperation, peace and dialogue.@@@The Kingdom has always supported international multilateral action, in accordance with United Nations principles, to strengthen international cooperation and address the challenges facing our world.@@@My country actively participates in all efforts to achieve a more
just and peaceful world and a promising future for our peoples and future generations.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, eager to achieve the goals and purposes of the United Nations and maintain international peace and security, reiterates its call for Security Council reform to make it fairer in representing today’s world, more effective in dealing with the changes and developments of the international community, and more efficient in addressing its common challenges.@@@With regard to the wars and conflicts being waged throughout the world, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses the need to heed the voice of reason and wisdom, and for dialogue, negotiations and peaceful solutions to end fighting, protect civilians and provide prospects for peace, security and development for all.@@@We support all international efforts capable of providing a political solution that will end the Russia- Ukraine crisis, stop the fighting and protect lives and property, while maintaining international and regional security stability.@@@In the process of peacebuilding, overcoming challenges and achieving security, stability and prosperity with comprehensive economic development, we all need to pool our efforts, forge partnerships and promote cultural, civilizational and social exchange.@@@The Middle East region is in dire need of joint efforts to establish security and stability and ensure a better future that meets the aspirations of our peoples towards achieving development and prosperity.@@@The Jeddah Security and Development Summit, in which leaders of the United States and nine Arab States participated, was an opportunity to confirm joint action for a better future for the region, its countries and peoples.@@@We fully support the United Nations efforts to settle disputes peacefully; promote interdependence and integration regionally and internationally; strengthen cooperation based on the principles of the United Nations — respect for the sovereignty of States, non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their independence, territorial integrity, values and cultures — while diversity enriches understanding and coexistence.@@@Security and stability in the Middle East swiftly require a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question, pursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace Initiative and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@We condemn all unilateral measures that would undermine the two-State solution and call for their immediate cessation.@@@With regard to Yemen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its commitment to all efforts to maintain the truce and allow the Presidential Leadership Council to play its full role in establishing sustainable peace among Yemeni brethren, in accordance with the three terms of reference, including resolution 2216 (2015).@@@We continue to play our leading role as the major supporter in meeting the humanitarian and development needs of our brothers in Yemen.@@@In that context, we stress the need to lift all obstacles to the inflow of basic goods and the delivery of assistance, and to open the roads to Ta’iz, Yemen’s third largest city, which has been under siege since 2015.@@@As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is keen to support security, stability and development in Iraq, we have reinforced our bilateral and collective cooperation with it, including the flow of electricity among the Kingdom, Iraq and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.@@@My country insists that the relevant Security Council resolutions be respected to ensure the unity, stability and Arab nature of Syria, and supports the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to bring about a political solution to that conflict, in accordance with resolution 2254 (2015).@@@We need to prevent a further outbreak of violence, respect the ceasefire agreements and ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach all Syrians in need unhindered.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also supports the sovereignty, security and stability of Lebanon, and stresses the importance of implementing comprehensive political and economic structural reform that will ensure the country’s success in overcoming its current political and economic crisis.@@@Lebanon should not be a stepping stone for terrorists, drug trafficking or other criminal activities that would threaten regional peace and stability.@@@It is essential that the Lebanese Government be able to extend its control over all Lebanese territory, including the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Taif Agreement.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to deploy all efforts towards the convening of a dialogue among the Sudanese parties, wishing the Sudan and its people stability and prosperity.@@@We also reiterate our support for arrangements to meet the water needs of Egypt and the Sudan.@@@We reiterate our full support the Libyan ceasefire agreement signed on 23 October 2020 and the Libyan calls for departure of all foreign troops, fighters and mercenaries without delay, pursuant to resolution 2570 (2021).@@@The Kingdom reiterates the importance of supporting the security of Afghanistan and the continued delivery of humanitarian assistance to that country, which must not become a base for terrorist operations or a breeding ground for terrorism.@@@International peace and security cannot be established through an arms race or the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).@@@Instead, they will be secured through cooperation among States for achieving development and progress.@@@We call on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent the proliferation of WMDs and ensure that the Middle East is free of such weapons.@@@We call on Iran to fulfil its nuclear obligations expeditiously and fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and take serious measures to build confidence with its neighbours and the international community.@@@Humankind is facing common challenges that threaten economic recovery following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, most notably the security and availability of food and energy, supply chains, the environment and climate change challenges.@@@Our capacity to overcome those challenges very much depends on our collective efforts, strengthened cooperation and a balanced, fair and united international response.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is aware of the importance of cooperation to addressing the challenges of climate change and the need to deal with its negative effects.@@@In that regard, we attach particular importance to implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and supporting the gradual and responsible change towards diversified energy systems and sources that are more sustainable.@@@Achieving these goals requires everyone’s participation, bearing in mind the different national and regional circumstances, countries’ differing socioeconomic situations, the world energy situation and the access of all to such energy.@@@In reaffirming our pioneering role in the area of sustainability, the Kingdom has launched the initiatives of the Green Saudi Arabia and the Green Middle East in support of national and regional efforts in that regard.@@@We have announced ambitious goals to diversify sources of energy and optimize its production and consumption.@@@We have also launched initiatives to protect the environment, promote sustainable forestation, reduce emissions by 278 million tons annually by 2030 and achieve zero carbon emissions by 2060 through the circular carbon reduction approach, in accordance with the Kingdom’s development plans and its diversified economy.@@@My country is also keen to support the world economy by contributing to ensuring balanced energy markets.@@@We stress the importance of investing in fossil fuels and clean techniques in the coming two decades in order to meet the growing global demand and the interests of all consumers and producers, and to save the world from the negative consequences of unrealistic policies aimed at excluding the main sources of energy without considering the negative effects on world supply chains, inflation, high energy prices, increased unemployment rates and other security and socioeconomic effects.@@@The Kingdom, along with its international partners, works to mitigate the negative effects of armed conflicts and their painful repercussions on food security and 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially the goal to eradicate famine.@@@In that regard, it is important to facilitate the export of grains and other foodstuffs, whose prices are skyrocketing, thereby threatening famine.@@@My country contributes significantly to that issue.@@@Our total contribution in food and agricultural assistance has now reached nearly $2.89 billion.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, along with our brothers in the region, has announced a $10-billion contribution to that end by coordinating and uniting the efforts of 10 national and regional development funds.@@@The international community has achieved successive successes in addressing terrorism and extremism.@@@We must continue to work relentlessly to address and eradicate that scourge, which has no link to any race, religion or belief.@@@We stress the importance for the international community to act firmly against States that support and sponsor terrorism and extremism and try to exploit their extremist ideology to expand and create chaos.@@@The Kingdom is pursuing its efforts to promote construction and development in order to meet the aspirations of future generations and improve the quality of life, along with empowering women and youth to innovate and be open to dialogue, tolerance and coexistence.@@@The Kingdom attaches great importance to human rights, having drafted explicit texts to promote and protect them.@@@My country has also announced legislation pertaining to reforms pursuant to our Saudi 2030 Vision with the aim of achieving better legal and judiciary systems, in accordance with better international practices and criteria aligned with the Kingdom’s commitments to international treaties and conventions.@@@Pursuant to its ambitious vision for the future, my country has applied to host Expo 2030 under the theme: “The Era of Change: Leading the Planet to a Foresighted Tomorrow”.@@@If we succeed in that candidacy, we wish to bring the exhibition closer in spirit to the idea for which it was created, namely, “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future”, with the aim of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We thank those countries that have supported us in our candidacy.@@@In conclusion, we hope that our efforts will help convey our messages, values and principles to the world in a spirit of partnership and respect for a better future of humankind as a whole.@@@I	congratulate	you,
Mr. President, on your election to lead us through this seventy-seventh gathering of the General Assembly of the United Nations.@@@I wish you the best of luck as you take on that onerous task at this most difficult period of the world.@@@As we would say in Ghana, our world is currently not in a good place.@@@The World Bank observed last Thursday that the global economy was enduring its sharpest slowdown since 1970.@@@Two years ago, our world came to a thundering halt, as we cowered from a health crisis triggered by a malicious unknown virus, leading to a devastating global economic pandemic.@@@High budget deficits were no longer the concerns of developing nations alone.@@@By 2021, coronavirus disease had pushed Africa into the worst recession in half a century.@@@A slump in productivity and revenues, increased pressures on spending and spiralling public debt confronted us without relent.@@@As we grappled with these economic challenges, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine burst upon us, aggravating an already difficult situation.@@@It is not just the dismay that we feel at seeing such deliberate devastation of cities and towns in Europe in the year 2022; we are feeling this war directly in our lives in Africa.@@@Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa.@@@The economic turmoil is global, with inflation as the number one enemy this year.@@@It hit a 40-year high in the United States and the United Kingdom in recent months.@@@There is record inflation in the euro zone.@@@Several African countries have inflation rates surging three to four times higher than what they were just two years ago.@@@In Ghana, we are experiencing the highest inflation in 21 years.@@@The high cost of food is hurting the poor, especially the urban poor, the most.@@@Moreover, the spillover from central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation has been severe beyond borders, as global investors pull money out of developing economies to invest in bonds in the developed world.@@@This has led to depreciating currencies and increased borrowing costs, meaning that we need to raise and spend more of our own currencies to service our foreign debts in United States dollars.@@@It has become clear, if ever there was any doubt, that the international financial structure is skewed significantly against developing and emerging economies such as Ghana’s.@@@The avenues that are opened to powerful nations to enable them to take measures that would ease pressures on their economies are closed to small nations.@@@To make matters worse, credit-rating agencies have been quick to downgrade economies in Africa, making it harder to service our debts.@@@The tag of Africa as an investment risk is little more than, in substance, a self-fulfilling prophecy created by the prejudice of the international money markets, which denies us access to cheaper borrowing, pushing us deeper into debt.@@@The financial markets have been set up and operate on rules designed for the benefit of rich and powerful nations, and, during times of crisis, the facade of international cooperation under which they purport to operate disappears.@@@These are the savage lessons that we have had to take in, as the world emerged from the grip of the coronavirus to face energy and food price hikes and a worldwide rise in the cost of living.@@@The necessity for reform of the system is compelling.@@@I am a modest student of history, yet I would say it is doubtful that any generation of inhabitants of this earth has ever witnessed such a perfect storm of global economic chaos, a war with global consequences and an unwillingness or inability to find a consensus to deal with the catastrophe.@@@It is under such circumstances that we have gathered under the theme: “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@The problems we face are indeed many and vary in level of importance, depending on where one is in the global order of things.@@@Just last year, the focus was on energy transition.@@@This year, it is about energy security, as Europe goes back to burning coal to replace Russian gas.@@@Nevertheless, we do not have the luxury of being able to pick and choose which big problem to solve.@@@None of them can wait.@@@The economic turbulence requires urgent and immediate solution.@@@The turmoil and insecurity in many parts of the world require urgent attention, and so does the need to tackle the problems posed by climate change.@@@A watershed moment it is, indeed, and history will judge us harshly if we do not seize the opportunity to make the changes that will enable us to deal with the many problems we face.@@@A case in point is the destabilizing conflict in the Sahel.@@@It might look to many today as a local conflict that affects only the countries in that region.@@@We, in Ghana, know differently: we have watched in horror as the unrest has inexorably moved from the Sahel to the coastal countries of West Africa.@@@All of Ghana’s neighbours have suffered terrorist attacks, and some have lost territorial space to the invading forces.@@@Furthermore, the terrorist pressure has provided a pretext for the unhappy reappearance of military rule in 3 of the 15 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), 2 of which have borne the brunt of the terrorist outrages in the region — Mali and Burkina Faso.@@@It is a development we are determined to reverse, so that the ECOWAS space remains a democratic one.@@@All of us in the region are being forced to spend huge amounts of money on security.@@@We should be spending this money on educating our young people and giving them skills, and on building much-needed roads, bridges, hospitals and other such infrastructure.@@@Instead, we are spending this money to fight terrorists or to keep them from destabilizing our countries.@@@This is a global problem, deserving the attention of the world community, for a global solution.@@@I am contributing to this debate on a date that has special significance for us in Ghana.@@@The date of 21 September is the one on which we mark the birth of our first President, Mr. Kwame Nkrumah.@@@He would have been 113 years old today, and it is worth recalling on this day the driving force of his political career, which was to contribute to the birth of a united Africa, that is, a United States of Africa.@@@We recognize today, more than ever before, the importance of the strength in unity of Africa, and we are working to shed the image of a helpless, hapless continent.@@@There is a renewed commitment towards
inclusive and sustainable industrialization and economic integration, and the intensity of the challenges we face today is only matched, as never before, by the immensity of the opportunity before us.@@@We, the current leaders of Africa, should be determined not to waste the crisis with which we are confronted.@@@Incidentally, the year 2022 is billed as Africa’s year to take action on food and nutrition development goals.@@@We see the current geopolitical crisis as an opportunity to rely less on food imports from outside the continent and use our 60 per cent global share of arable lands better to increase food production.@@@We have seen the devastating impact of relying on Russia and Ukraine for 70 per cent of our wheat consumption.@@@We have enough land, enough water, enough gas and enough manpower to produce enough fertilizer, food and energy for ourselves and others.@@@But we also recognize that we cannot do it all by ourselves.@@@Our message to the global investor community is therefore this: Africa is ready for business.@@@Africa needs the global investor community, and that community needs Africa.@@@It needs Africa because Africa is busily building the world’s largest single market, with 1.3 billion people.@@@Soon we will have a customs union, and we will also soon have a continental payment system that will accelerate and facilitate trade among ourselves.@@@Already, goods and services are flowing more freely across our artificial borders.@@@Africa must be seen for what it is: the new frontier for manufacturing, technology and food production.@@@That is why six years ago, I launched in Ghana the successful policy of “One District, One Factory”, which is a policy that, with Government incentives, has directly seen, so far, some 125 factories being set up in various districts across the country, leveraging on each area’s competitive advantage.@@@That is why, six years ago, my Government embarked on an aggressive policy of planting for food and jobs, which has helped our farmers increase their yields many times over.@@@Indeed, we are recognizing that many of the things we import can be found or produced in Ghana or in other African countries.@@@The African Continental Free Trade Area, whose secretariat is located in Accra, Ghana’s capital, is driving intra-African trade and creating an unparalleled momentum for our continent’s economic diversity and transformation.@@@We know that industrialization is the way to go and, with the single market as the added incentive, we have taken policy measures in Ghana to add value to our natural resources.@@@For example, we are processing more of our cocoa and refining more of our gold, and we are determined to exploit the entire value chain of our huge lithium deposits.@@@We are busily building an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry and an integrated iron and steel industry.@@@We are also building new oil refineries and have, so far, attracted six of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers to set up assembling plants in Ghana, prior to producing them in the country.@@@In line with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Africa’s ambition is, anchored in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme and the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods, to transform our food systems over the next decade.@@@What we require now is support from the investor community for the rolling out of Africa’s lucrative agro-industry and for that community to see agribusiness in Africa as much more an opportunity than the perceived exaggerated risk, which has been the false but dominant narrative.@@@In conclusion, on 25 July 2016, the General Assembly adopted resolution 70/293, proclaiming 2016-2025 as the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa, with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization charged with the task of leading it in collaboration with a range of partners.@@@I believe it is time for the United Nations to take proper stock of this initiative and ask a few searching questions, recognizing what could have been achieved with greater commitment and focus.@@@Working together, we can get our world back into a better and happier place.@@@It is with humility and deep respect that I address the General Assembly today — both as the newly elected Chancellor of Germany and as a proud representative to our United Nations.@@@My country and the United Nations are indivisibly linked.@@@Today’s democratic and reunited Germany owes its role on the world stage to our international friends and partners who placed their trust in us to become and to remain a peace-loving member of the international community.@@@We know that we owe our freedom, our stability and our prosperity to an international order with the United Nations at its core.@@@Therefore, my
country’s commitment to this Organization and its noble goals — peace, development and equal rights and dignity for every human being — will never wane.@@@Unfortunately, I am expressing that commitment at a time when we are getting further away from those noble goals.@@@After decades during which we overcame walls and blocs — a time when we marked the fall of the Iron Curtain and German reunification.@@@After the technological revolution of the Internet and the digital transformation, which have made us more interconnected than ever before, we are now facing a new fragmentation of the world.@@@New wars and conflicts have emerged.@@@Major global crises are piling up before us and are combining and reinforcing one another.@@@Some have even seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules.@@@It is true that the risks to our global order are real.@@@And yet I do not hold with the image of a world without rules — for two reasons:@@@First, our world has clear rules.@@@Rules that we, the United Nations, created together.@@@The Charter of the United Nations promises all of us freedom and peaceful coexistence.@@@This Charter is our collective rejection of a world without rules.@@@Our problem is not the absence of rules.@@@Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by them and enforce them.@@@But the image of a world without rules leads us astray for a second reason.@@@If we do not defend, further develop and strengthen our global order together, then it is not chaos without rules that we face, but a world in which the rules are made by those who can dictate them to us by dint of their military, economic or political power.@@@The alternative to a rules-based world is not anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the weak.@@@The vast majority of us cannot be indifferent to whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day.@@@The key question that we as an international community face is this — should we stand helplessly by and watch as some seek to cast us back into a global order in which war is a common instrument of politics, in which independent nations have to submit to their stronger neighbours or their colonial masters, in which prosperity and human rights are a privilege of the lucky few?@@@Or will we manage to stand together and ensure that the multipolar world of the twenty-first century remains a multilateral world?@@@My answer, as a German and a European, is this: we have to manage that.@@@We will manage that if we take three fundamental principles to heart.@@@First, the international order does not happen by itself.@@@If we do nothing, then the Charter is but a piece of paper.@@@The Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.@@@We must not stand idly by when a major nuclear Power, armed to the teeth — a founding Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, no less — seeks to shift borders through the use of violence.@@@There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against Ukraine.@@@President Putin is waging that war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine.@@@Self-determination and political independence do not count for him.@@@There is only one word for that.@@@It is imperialism, plain and simple.@@@The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe; it is also a disaster for our global peaceful order, which is the antithesis of imperialism and neocolonialism.@@@That is why it was so important that, here in this Hall, 141 countries categorically condemned Russia’s war of occupation (see resolution ES-11/1).@@@But that alone is not enough.@@@If we want the war to end, we cannot be indifferent to how it ends.@@@Putin will give up his war and his imperialist ambitions only if he realizes that he cannot win.@@@In doing so, he is not just destroying Ukraine but is also ruining his own country.@@@That is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia.@@@That is why we will not accept any sham referendums.@@@That is why Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.@@@We are supporting Ukraine with all our might—financially, economically and with humanitarian assistance, as well as with weapons.@@@Together with our partners around the world, we imposed tough economic sanctions on the Russian leadership and Russia’s economy.@@@That is how we are making good on a promise that each and every of our countries made when joining the United Nations, namely, to join forces to maintain international peace and security.@@@There is one more thing that I would like to add, which is that not one sack of grain has been held back on account of those sanctions.@@@Russia alone has prevented Ukrainian grain ships from putting out to sea, bombing ports and destroying agricultural enterprises.@@@“Where hunger prevails, there can be no peace.”@@@(A/PV2128, p.3).@@@My predecessor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Willy Brandt, said that when he addressed this Assembly in 1973, as the first Federal Chancellor to do so.@@@Today we are witnessing that that sentence also works the other way around.@@@Those who want there to be no hunger must ensure that Putin’s war does not prevail — this war that even in countries far away from Russia is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and famine.@@@The fact that grain exports have been made possible once again thanks to the mediation efforts of Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye deserves great respect.@@@Germany is also supporting Ukraine with the export of food, and we will stand by Ukraine when it comes to shouldering the enormous costs of rebuilding the country.@@@At an international expert conference that I will host with the President of the European Commission in Berlin on 25 October, together with supporters of Ukraine from all around the world, we will think about how we can manage that Herculean task.@@@Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack, for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainian people and for the protection of our international order.@@@The second principle for preserving that order is as follows.@@@All of us will be judged against the obligations that we have jointly entered into.@@@Responsibility always begins at home.@@@Let us take climate change, for example, which is the biggest challenge of our generation.@@@We, the industrialized countries and major emitters of greenhouse-gases, have a very special responsibility in that regard.@@@With that in mind, we reiterated our intention at the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Germany in June to forge ahead in order to achieve the 1.5°C target, not despite the war and the energy crisis, but precisely because climate neutrality also leads to greater energy security.@@@We stand by our pledges to support emerging economies and developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, with new, fair energy transition partnerships, for example.@@@We will not abandon countries that are struggling the most in the face of loss and damage as a result of climate change.@@@By the time of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt, we therefore want to establish a global shield against climate risks.@@@Our yardstick must be the obligations that we have entered into.@@@Nowhere does that insight seem more obvious to me than in the protection of human rights, since they reflect the deepest need of each and every one of us to live our lives in freedom, unharmed and in dignity.@@@That lies at the heart of what makes us humans, who we are and what we have in common, no matter where we come from, no matter what we believe and no matter whom we love.@@@I say that with the history of my country in mind.@@@Germany, which betrayed all civilized values with the murder of 6 million Jews, an act that is without parallel, is aware of just how fragile our civilization is.@@@At the same time, we have an obligation to respect and defend human rights at all times and in all places.@@@My country is the second-largest donor to the United Nations system and the second-largest donor of humanitarian assistance.@@@In Germany in recent years, we have taken in millions of refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and, most recently, Ukraine.@@@That is something of which we are proud.@@@But we also have to pay heed and take action in places where hundreds of thousands are made to endure suffering, tyranny and torture in prison camps or jails, such as in North Korea, Syria, Iran and Belarus.@@@We must pay heed and take action when the Taliban deprive women and girls in Afghanistan of their most basic rights, and we must pay heed and take action when Russia commits war crimes in Mariupol, Bucha and Irpin.@@@We will bring the murderers to justice.@@@We are doing everything in our power to support the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Committee of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the Human Rights Council.@@@Particularly those who bear particular responsibility for our order in the world by dint of their strength and their influence should have an interest in bolstering our common institutions.@@@The former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights briefed us about the situation of the Uighurs in Xinjiang a few weeks ago.@@@China should implement the High Commissioner’s recommendations.@@@That would be a sign of sovereignty and strength and a guarantee of change for the better.@@@A third principle must be taken into consideration if we are to preserve the international order.@@@We must adapt our rules and institutions to the reality of the twenty-first century.@@@Far too often, those rules and institutions reflect the world of 30, 50 or 70 years ago.@@@That also goes for the Security Council.@@@For many years, Germany has been committed to its reform and its expansion, first and foremost to include the countries of the global South.@@@Germany is also prepared to assume greater responsibility as a permanent member and, initially, as a non-permanent member for the term from 2027 to 2028.@@@I kindly ask Member States to support our candidacy — the candidacy of a country that respects the principles of the United Nations and offers and seeks cooperation.@@@To my mind, it is entirely natural that the up-and-coming, dynamic countries and regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America must be given a stronger political voice on the world stage.@@@That is in all of our interests, as it gives rise to joint responsibility and greater acceptance of our decisions.@@@Nationalism and isolation will not solve the challenges of our age.@@@More cooperation, more partnership and more involvement are the only reasonable response, whether in the fight against climate change, global health risks, inflation and disrupted supply chains or our approach to displacement and migration.@@@I say that with profound conviction.@@@The insight that openness and cooperation safeguard peace and prosperity has made the past decades the happiest in the history of my country so far.@@@As President of the G-7 this year, it is therefore a key priority for me to promote a new form of cooperation with the countries of the global South that not only claims to take place on a level playing field, but one on which actors genuinely see eye to eye, especially since that level playing field has long existed de facto if we consider the increasing political, economic and demographic influence of Asia, Africa and Latin America.@@@From the outset, we coordinated our objectives very closely with Indonesia, as the holder of the Group of 20 presidency.@@@We have involved the countries holding the chairmanship of the African Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, as well as India and South Africa, in our G-7 discussions.@@@That gave rise to new models of global cooperation that have one thing in common, namely, the fact that they are characterized by joint responsibility and mutual solidarity.@@@We are fighting the hunger crisis with a new Alliance for Global Food Security, and I would like to invite all Member States to join the Alliance.@@@We launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in order to jointly mobilize $600 billion for public and private infrastructure investments around the world over the next five years.@@@In doing so, we are taking a big step towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@With a newly emerging climate club, we are pressing ahead with friends and partners worldwide to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change even more swiftly and efficiently.@@@Such approaches are pillars that support our international order because they deliver results from which citizens in all our countries stand to benefit and that they expect from the United Nations.@@@“We the peoples” — it is not for nothing that those are the first three words of our Charter.@@@We should note that those words are not “We the Member States” or “We the representatives”.@@@We have an obligation to our peoples.@@@We owe them a global order that allows them to live in peace, which protects their rights and which opens up opportunities for education, health and development for them.@@@Such an order does not come about by itself.@@@Defending, further developing and strengthening it is our task as the United Nations.@@@Germany extends the hand of cooperation to all Member States in that endeavour.@@@Standing before this Assembly of world nations, I wanted to speak about peace and about challenges that the world is facing today — income inequality, pandemics and climate change.@@@Unfortunately, today I have to speak about war — the war in Europe, a war that only deepens and does not resolve other issues.@@@Ever since the founding of the United Nations, the Organization’s central idea has been that of bringing countries together and ensuring peaceful coexistence.@@@After the terrible suffering of the Second World War, addressing global threats to international peace and security was the overriding concern.@@@We owe a great deal to those past leaders who struggled to recreate global order out of profound disorder.@@@The darkest hour in human history inspired the creation of the rules that remain essential to the global coexistence of nations.@@@For the first time in our history, peace finally became a global value to be protected.@@@Against all odds, the language of military aggression and conquest was condemned.@@@In the context of global challenges, we often talk about human rights, but what about countries’ right to be sovereign and defend their territorial integrity?@@@On 24 February, a permanent member of the Security Council started an unjustified, unprovoked and illegal war against a neighbouring country.@@@That gross violation of international law undermined the very essence of the United Nations.@@@For the past seven months, Russia’s war on Ukraine has taken a terrible toll on the Ukrainian people.@@@Many thousands have been tortured and killed.@@@Millions have been displaced or forced to flee their homeland.@@@However, the war has not broken the will of the brave Ukrainian people to defend their country.@@@It has not diminished their fighting spirit.@@@The massacres at Bucha and Izyum have not brought them to their knees.@@@Their inherent love of freedom, passed from one generation to another, is still there, undefeated, unspoiled.@@@Despite all the challenges, Ukrainians have proved to be remarkably strong defenders of liberty and democratic values.@@@Inspired by their heroic struggle, the international community should take an even more active role in boosting Ukrainian resilience to withstand their hardships.@@@Every State Member of the United Nations is expected to respect the rules of international order that we have created over the course of decades, and it is up to us to decide what can be tolerated and what cannot, where the red lines are and when they are crossed.@@@How can we tolerate a member of the international community in a war of conquest and annihilation, a country that is deliberately attacking the rules-based world order, a country whose actions make it more difficult for all of us to maintain peace and security across the globe?@@@Today I call on everyone here to look closely at what is happening in Ukraine.@@@Who is the aggressor and who is the victim?@@@Behind the mask of an energy superpower there is a dangerous colonial Power seeking to occupy and annex its neighbours, searching for reasons to justify the annexation, rewriting history, using economic and energy blackmail and spreading disinformation and propaganda.@@@We all know that Russia’s violations of the founding principles of the United Nations did not start seven months ago.@@@Its destructive actions have undermined international security for many years, breaching arms- control treaties, using prohibited chemical weapons
both at home and abroad, continually violating the territorial integrity not only of Ukraine, but of Georgia and Moldova as well, and interfering in the elections of other countries.@@@Those are just a few examples.@@@The ongoing suffering of the Ukrainian people has been further amplified by Russia’s proxy, the Belarusian regime.@@@It has enabled military attacks by another country from its territory.@@@It continues to provide support for offensive operations against Ukraine.@@@Unfortunately, it has surrendered Belarus’s national sovereignty to its big neighbour.@@@The past few months have also revealed the danger of a looming nuclear disaster in Europe.@@@The deployment of Russian military personnel and weaponry at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant is alarming and totally unacceptable.@@@It disregards the safety and security principles that all members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are committed to respecting.@@@A nuclear power plant should never be used as a military base.@@@Moreover, Russia’s irresponsible rhetoric on the possible use of nuclear weapons directly contradicts its role as a permanent five (P5) State and the commitment it made in the January P5 leaders’ statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races.@@@We see a huge gap between declarations and real actions that is undermining trust in a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@We must collectively condemn such actions and require Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all troops from the entire territory of Ukraine.@@@It must also stop its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour.@@@That should include withdrawing military and other personnel from the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.@@@Lithuania therefore welcomes the active personal involvement of the Secretary-General.@@@His visits to Ukraine demonstrate supreme dedication to the ideals of the United Nations.@@@We note that the efforts of the Secretary-General and Tiirkiye were instrumental in reaching the deal on resuming Ukrainian grain exports.@@@We also acknowledge the positive role played by other actors, such as the African Union leadership, in coming to that arrangement.@@@It is an achievement shared by the whole community of nations.@@@Once again, international efforts have helped us to avert a global catastrophe.@@@The grain exports via Ukrainian ports will sustain and feed millions of people.@@@We should be in no doubt that it was the war in Ukraine that threatened to trigger global hunger, and we cannot be sure that this danger will not return until the Russian armed forces are withdrawn from the whole territory of Ukraine.@@@There must be no impunity for the brutal crimes and atrocities committed during the war.@@@Guaranteeing justice and accountability is of vital importance from the standpoint of the credibility of the United Nations and the international community.@@@We should consolidate and advance our legal efforts.@@@We must ensure that all those responsible for this unprecedented assault on Ukrainian and European peace and security are held accountable.@@@Lithuania will continue to engage in accountability mechanisms to address the mass atrocities being committed in Ukraine.@@@I call on the global community to establish a special tribunal to address war crimes in Ukraine.@@@It is also crucially important to ensure effective forms of reparations for the victims of those crimes.@@@Finally, we must consider the fact that Russia’s war in Ukraine is an extension of the wider context.@@@What do we see in Russia?@@@The human rights situation there is deteriorating.@@@Independent media and non-governmental organizations are being simply banished.@@@Similar developments are taking place in Belarus.@@@Systematic and widespread attacks target civil society, human rights defenders and independent media.@@@The number of political prisoners in Belarus now exceeds 1,200, and it continues to grow.@@@That is truly alarming and requires more attention from the international community.@@@Lithuania has provided asylum to Russians and Belarusians — representatives of non-governmental organizations and independent media — who were persecuted in their home countries.@@@For Lithuania, the time for a business-as-usual approach is over.@@@We have demonstrated that by building energy independence and accelerating our green transition.@@@I invite all countries to stop financing this bloody war by refusing to buy the aggressor’s energy resources, which would significantly affect its ability to continue this brutal war.@@@Lithuania has supported Ukraine since the first days of this terrible war.@@@We have not been silent.@@@We have stepped up to help Ukraine in every way we can.@@@Our Government, as well as civil society, has been active in providing both military and humanitarian aid.@@@We have taken in more than 60,000 refugees, mostly
women and children.@@@To help them maintain a sense of belonging, we have established a Ukrainian centre in Vilnius, the first centre of its kind outside Ukraine.@@@The war must end, but not with peace at any cost.@@@Ukrainian territorial integrity must be fully restored.@@@Any other outcome would mean further atrocities and long-standing insecurity.@@@While the aggressor has already demonstrated its eagerness to endanger the global population, we should not allow ourselves to be frightened.@@@The danger is real.@@@As history shows, pushing back against the aggressor is the only viable option.@@@Today I remain a strong believer in the transformative power of collective action, based on the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.@@@Together we can ensure global peace and security.@@@Together we will make a difference.@@@Let me assure the Assembly that Lithuania is and will always be a valuable partner in fighting for the right cause — in fighting for long-lasting peace.@@@Namibia congratulates Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@He can be assured of Namibia’s full support as he provides leadership during his tenure.@@@I would also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his sterling stewardship as President of the Assembly at its seventy- sixth session.@@@Since attaining our political independence 32 years ago, we are proud of the work we have undertaken towards the second phase of our struggle for economic independence.@@@During this period we have built a strong foundation for our governance architecture with an emphasis on strengthening processes, systems and institutions.@@@Given those advances in effective governance, we are optimistic in our quest to deal with the triple challenges of inequality, unemployment and poverty.@@@Our impact plan, the Harambee Prosperity Plan II, which is accelerating the implementation of our national development plans, is fast-tracking our efforts towards our Vision 2030.@@@Since my term of office will end on 20 March 2025 and we are a nation with a Constitution that limits the Head of State to two terms, we have set in motion the process for an orderly succession to continue with our peaceful development.@@@The ruling party, the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), which I lead, is currently conducting primaries.@@@There is a real possibility that the next candidate of the SWAPO party for the national presidential elections will be a woman or a young man from the generation that was never in exile.@@@The presence of women in the line of succession is a demonstration of the strides we have made in gender equality, with women’s representation at 40 per cent in the National Assembly.@@@Moreover, 90 per cent of our banks are headed by women.@@@Namibia is a child of international solidarity, midwifed by the United Nations.@@@We therefore believe firmly in solidarity and partnership as critical enablers of our development aspirations.@@@At this juncture I would like to thank the Secretary- General for his comprehensive report on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which makes clear recommendations for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and all existing global agreements through multilateralism, with the United Nations at the centre of our efforts.@@@I commend the Secretary-General for his visionary leadership in proposing that we should meet in a summit of the future to reflect on the challenges and opportunities that await current and future generations.@@@Namibia supports the convening of that important summit at the earliest opportunity.@@@Over the past few months, it has been encouraging to see concerted efforts to train a spotlight on transforming education and advancing SDG 4.@@@Education is a sector that Namibia has consistently prioritized through its allocation of resources, both human and financial, and its consistent prioritization of policy development.@@@In the context of the recently concluded Transformation of Education Summit, Namibia commits to transformative leadership, ensuring access to inclusive digital technologies and developing a strategy for innovative financing and resource mobilization.@@@In Namibia, the education sector receives the largest share of budgetary support, equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and almost a quarter of the total national budget.@@@The Namibian Government offers free primary and secondary education, which demonstrates its commitment to prioritizing and expanding access to education for all.@@@Furthermore, we are proud of the recent landing of the Google Equiano sub-sea cable, which will figure largely in changing Namibia’s digital transformation landscape and narrowing its digital divide, in line with our commitment to leveraging the fourth industrial revolution.@@@In Namibia, we have set up a fourth industrial revolution task force, which recently made recommendations on how Namibia can strengthen domestic capabilities to derive optimal gains from the fourth industrial revolution.@@@In line with the recommendations of the task force, the Government is currently developing a consolidated national fourth industrial revolution strategy to provide overarching
direction and multisectoral planning.@@@The strategy will prioritize education reform to close the fourth industrial revolution skills gap, as well as cybersecurity and the expansion of the information and communications technology infrastructure and services.@@@Global debt is at an unprecedented level and interest rates are rising.@@@That reality limits our fiscal space.@@@As we talk about our collective aspirations, we should remain acutely aware of the vulnerabilities facing developing countries.@@@Namibia’s classification as an upper-middle-income country presents challenges with regard to mobilizing resources to finance our development goals.@@@As I said, taking our GDP and dividing it by our small population, thereby deriving a high per capita income, is without doubt a flawed formula that requires urgent consideration.@@@The formula does not take into account the vast income disparities between the wealthy whites and the poor blacks, which is a consequence of 100 years of colonialism and apartheid occupation.@@@However, I am pleased to hear that a number of developing and developed countries are in agreement on the unfairness of that classification, which denies countries such as Namibia access to soft loans and grants, which are necessary to fight inequality and lift many out of poverty.@@@The motto for the seventy-seventh session, “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”, calls on us to deal with the issues that affect us all.@@@Therefore, I am confident that the unfair classification of countries such as Namibia as upper- middle-income countries will enjoy priority attention.@@@Over the past few months, we have witnessed stark geopolitical tensions, a reminder of the fragility of our world order.@@@Threats to peace and security come at great cost to the men, women and children trapped in such situations.@@@The Russia-Ukraine conflict is now in its seventh month, with serious consequences for food and energy supply chains.@@@Namibia believes that dialogue is the condition sine qua non for the peaceful resolution of any conflict.@@@The United Nations was created for the maintenance of peace and security and should lead a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.@@@Namibia, as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council and Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, continues to demonstrate its commitment to regional and continental stability by advocating the advancement of infrastructure for peace, democracy and the protection of human rights.@@@In that regard, as the new Chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, I call for the holding of peaceful general elections in the Kingdom of Lesotho on 7 October.@@@SADC is also seized with developments in the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Republic of Mozambique.@@@In that vein, I have commenced a process of dialogue with the leaders of Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique in order to ensure the successful implementation of SADC decisions so that peace and stability may prevail in our region.@@@I always say that inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict.@@@Africa is a continent of 1.2 billion citizens, and the exclusion of Africa from the Security Council is an injustice.@@@As long as the Council fails to reflect current global realities in its stature and composition, it will not be able to adequately address global concerns.@@@We therefore reiterate our call for the reform of the Security Council, in line with the Common African Position.@@@Self-determination is a human right.@@@The continued injustices meted out against the people of Palestine are a reminder of the urgent need to start implementing the two-State solution as the only viable alternative that can end inequality and bring peace to the peoples of both Palestine and Israel and indeed the region as a whole.@@@In the same vein, the lack of progress in implementing United Nations resolutions to resolve the question of Western Sahara should be something for which we all feel collectively ashamed.@@@Namibia pledges unwavering solidarity for nations that continue to bear the heavy burden of sanctions.@@@Namibia reiterates its long-standing call for the lifting of the unjust embargo against Cuba.@@@I met a 50-year-old Cuban man who has not known anything but sanctions.@@@Since he was born, sanctions were in place.@@@How long will that be continued?@@@If we are talking about building peace in the world, how can a country be sanctioned for such a long time?@@@Children who are born there do not know any other reality except one in which sanctions are imposed.@@@Please, it is time that the sons and daughters of Cuba be given their right to a decent life, free from an embargo that denies them their right to develop their own country.@@@The sanctions should be ended now.@@@We also call for the lifting of sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe.@@@Why are sanctions in place against a country that is making progress at all levels?@@@President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and the people of Zimbabwe have made laudable progress and reforms, which should be given a chance to succeed without the weight of sanctions.@@@The health of our planet is in serious jeopardy.@@@Our home is on fire.@@@We are experiencing unprecedented impacts of climate change, including severe droughts and ravaging field fires.@@@Time is a luxury we do not have.@@@We have to act decisively to reduce carbon emissions as our contribution to the preservation of our planet and people.@@@Namibia, like many developing countries, remains vulnerable to the asymmetrical impacts of climate change.@@@Therefore, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Namibia plans to announce major developments in its ambitions to decarbonize global hard-to-abate sectors through the production of green hydrogen.@@@Furthermore, the first hydrogen-to-power project in Africa is expected to be operational by 2024 in the town of Swakopmund, Namibia.@@@That is an example of what is possible when we pull together in the same direction.@@@Our ambitions are necessary not only to mitigate the ravaging impacts of climate change but also as a critical component of our post-pandemic economic recovery.@@@Therefore, Namibia remains ready to work with the international community to ensure the most optimal utilization of its natural resources to combat climate change.@@@A just energy transition is about providing fair opportunities for developing nations to sustainably access the natural endowments at their disposal.@@@Namibia recently discovered promising deposits of hydrocarbons and is exploring significant deposits of rare Earth metals.@@@As part of our goal to ensure the sustainable utilization of our natural resources, I recently launched the Welwitschia Fund, our nation’s sovereign wealth fund.@@@The fund is a demonstration of our commitment to fiscal prudence and sustainable resource management for current and future generations.@@@In conclusion, today, on 21 September, we are convened in this Hall on the International Day of Peace to discuss the theme “End racism.@@@Build peace”.@@@Peace is a wonderful gift, but it is a fragile one if it is not handled properly.@@@Peace is more than the absence of war; it is about inclusivity and the development of all nations.@@@Our United Nations, as the premier guarantor of multilateralism, is our best bet for ensuring a peaceful and prosperous humankind.@@@Namibia will continue to place a high premium on the noble aspirations of the United Nations as a beacon of hope and equality for all nations.@@@As a beneficiary of successful multilateral efforts, we hold in high regard the convening power of the General Assembly and recommit to working with fellow Member States to change the world for the better.@@@I begin my statement by conveying the apologies of our President, Mr. Luis Abinader Corona, who, for unexpected reasons resulting from Hurricane Fiona, which has severely affected several provinces of our country, was unable to participate in this important general debate.@@@I cannot continue without first expressing our condolences to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as to the members and observers of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.@@@Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.@@@After a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease.@@@But who would have foreseen that, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe?@@@It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.@@@Those would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind.@@@That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence.@@@Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, far-reaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.@@@It is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating.@@@It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism.@@@As part of a substantive reform, the General Assembly must be given greater powers and participation in order to reduce the excessive use of the veto in the Security Council, especially when it comes to issues involving human rights violations and support for humanitarian assistance.@@@Another pressing issue is climate change and its devastating effects, which call for proactive solidarity with those that are the least able to deal with it effectively.@@@As an island, our country is ready to make concrete proposals in the context of the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Naturally, our positions, as small island developing States, demand that the countries that contribute most to global warming maintain on their agendas a vital cooperation mechanism with those that suffer the most from the effects of climate change.@@@We therefore seek a greater commitment to funding for adaptation and mitigation given the crisis.@@@Small countries, such as ours, are significantly increasing their education programmes, at the expense of other essential aspects of development.@@@For that reason, we attach particular importance to the Summit on Transforming Education and the establishment of the United Nations Youth Office and Youth Mobilization Day.@@@Our country has a population of 70 per cent young people.@@@We believe in their meaningful, full and equal participation in decision-making.@@@Today humankind needs results that promote peace and prevent new conflicts, especially those that pose a threat to the very existence of the planet.@@@The Dominican Republic therefore supports the total elimination of nuclear weapons and, as proof of that,
tomorrow we will deposit our instrument of ratification for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@As part of that commitment to multilateralism and a greater presence in the community of international organizations, our country is seeking a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period from 2024 to 2026.@@@It is our genuine desire to be part of that Council for the first time and, to that end, we hope to have the support of this community of nations.@@@The twenty-first century ushered in many positive developments to improve the living conditions of all humankind, but, unfortunately, events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have created not only distress due to the loss of human lives, but also a dangerous increase in hunger in various regions, many of which are far removed from that conflict.@@@With Russia and Ukraine being the world’s main producers of grain and fertilizers, the conflict has jeopardized the global distribution of that important food source, not to mention how Europe is being affected by shortages of fuel, of which Russia is a major supplier.@@@We welcome the Security Council’s extension of the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) until July 2023, including the establishment of a unit to deal with sexual and gender-based violence, one of the most abhorrent manifestations of that violent context.@@@The expected results of BINUH are dependent, first, on Haitians reaching a national agreement as a starting point to combat and rein in the gangs and, secondly, on ensuring the holding of elections as soon as conditions allow.@@@Unfortunately, that approach has not succeeded.@@@In that regard, the Dominican Republic believes that, as we have reiterated numerous times, stabilization efforts in Haiti must be focused on immediate peacemaking and political dialogue as the only appropriate means to deal with the violence and disorder.@@@As the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Haiti has stated, I would like to reiterate that criminal gangs have increased their suffocating grip on Port-au-Prince, and everything suggests that the Haitian National Police does not have the capacity to contain them.@@@It is the responsibility of the Haitian authorities to control and put an end to the gang activity that is resulting in crimes so heinous they may amount to crimes against humanity.@@@We must take off our blindfolds and acknowledge that the Haitian National Police alone is not able to carry out the capacity-building necessary to maintain order and subdue the gangs.@@@Security Council resolution 2645 (2022) puts us in a position to implement that necessary process and to take the decisions most needed for preventing the situation in Haiti from completely exceeding the reach of normal channels.@@@The paragraphs of the resolution are indeed binding, and I would therefore like to highlight the following.@@@First, we need to ban without delay the illicit transfer and trafficking of small arms, light weapons and ammunition to anyone who participates in or supports gang violence, criminal activities or human rights abuses in Haiti.@@@Secondly, we emphasize the importance of taking appropriate measures, including by freezing the assets or banning the travel of those involved in promoting the state of violence and terror prevailing in Haiti and affecting the entire region.@@@Thirdly, the actions to be taken by the Secretary- General with regard to enhancing security support for the Haitian National Police’s efforts to combat the high levels of violence, as stipulated in paragraph 10 of resolution 2645 (2022), must be carried out with the urgency they demand.@@@Fourthly, an urgent Haitian-led political agreement needs to be reached by all the parties concerned with a view to organizing legislative and presidential elections that include the full participation of the entire population, especially that of women, young people and civil society.@@@In that regard, we consider it important to strongly endorse what Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in his interview on French television on 18 September — that it is imperative to address the security situation in Haiti and that, in addition to capacity-building for police training, what is needed is a robust police force that is capable of restoring peace and putting an end to the violence perpetrated by armed gangs, which have permeated the political and economic power structures.@@@We have asked ourselves on many occasions whether the most catastrophic event for the Haitian people was the 2010 earthquake that devastated Port- au-Prince, causing the death of some 220,000 people, including 102 United Nations staff members, or the
current situation, which may be characterized as a low-intensity conflict.@@@The answer, I have no doubt, is that, despite the horrible suffering caused by the earthquake, the current situation is more desperate for the Haitian people.@@@In the face of the earthquake in 2010, all Haitians came together in solidarity as one people and worked to support and rescue their neighbours.@@@Similarly, concerted action was also taken at the global level to deliver relief to Haiti.@@@The Dominican people of course immediately came to the aid of our Haitian brothers and sisters.@@@In addition to the natural disasters it has faced, in 1986 Haiti’s entire population, compelled by its civic spirit, came together to end the dictatorship that had lasted there for more than two decades.@@@In other words, the Haitian people have historical experience in uniting together to face adversity.@@@Today the situation is dramatically different.@@@Faced with the inability of the authorities to establish order and ensure public security, most people are paralysed with fear and, as a result, the resilient Haitian population feels abandoned to its own fate.@@@The violence, which has created deep fragmentations in society, makes even the most basic social cohesion impossible, while Haitians are left to wait in despair for the delayed help of the international community.@@@As President Abinader Corona said last year in his address to the General Assembly, Haiti can wait no longer (see A/76/PV.9).@@@We must act responsibly, and we must act now.@@@The Dominican Republic reaffirms its belief that the only way to secure a lasting and sustainable response to the Haitian crisis is to ensure that it comes from Haitian people themselves.@@@Despite the difficulties in reaching agreements, we urge and hope for that to happen so as to enable the people of Haiti to take the path required for achieving the consensus needed in their society to overcome such a grave situation.@@@International collaboration is vital if we are to successfully bring stability and peace to the people of Haiti, its neighbours and the region.@@@That is our only objective.@@@The Dominican Republic was a signatory to the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 and continues to fulfil its obligations with the same sense of responsibility with which it has done so for 77 years.@@@We have played a role in the General Assembly’s adoption of historic decisions and resolutions.@@@The Assembly can rest assured that our country will continue to play its part in the concert of nations.@@@We stand ready to continue contributing to the strengthening of the United Nations, an instrument that continues to be fundamental to the maintenance of world peace and security.@@@It is a great honour and a real pleasure for me to speak from this rostrum to express the voice of my country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the main issues that are currently of great concern to the international community.@@@I would like to begin by congratulating the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I am convinced that he will
do his best to ensure the success of this session, and I assure him of my country’s full support.@@@The major challenges facing humankind today are security and peace for all, addressing climate change, reviving the global economy after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), combating poverty and promoting our collective well-being.@@@Those key challenges are complex and intertwined.@@@Aware of that reality, I welcome the wise choice and relevance of the central theme of this meeting, namely, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@Clearly, meeting those challenges requires greater consultation, cooperation and solidarity among States and nations.@@@The maintenance of international peace and security is the foundation and the primary objective of the creation of the United Nations.@@@Neither indifference, nor inaction, nor a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the United Nations is therefore acceptable in the face of any threat to international peace and security.@@@To date, the issue of international peace and security has crystallized around the fight against terrorism and the extinction of hotbeds of tension in Europe and Africa.@@@Indeed, terrorism has spared no continent.@@@After Asia, Western Europe and North America, it metastasized in Africa, where it has set fire to several places, and our continent is paying a heavy price.@@@In the Sahel, in the East, in the West, in the Centre and in the South of the continent, terrorists kill innocent populations in barbaric expeditions and destabilize States in the name of religious fundamentalism.@@@It is true that outstanding progress has been made in the Middle East in the fight against this scourge.@@@However, it is far from abating, let alone being eradicated from our planet.@@@That is why the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the African victims of terrorism and a member of the Global Coalition against Da’esh, calls on the United Nations to become actively involved in implementing the recommendations of the Coalition and those of the Aqaba process.@@@Declarations of intent and proclamations of faith without vigorous collective action on the ground will never be enough to eradicate terrorism.@@@In the heart of Europe, the war between Russia and Ukraine is a gaping wound whose bleeding reaches even to distant Africa and disrupts international trade because of the significant collateral damage, particularly in terms of the supply of cereals and energy products of Ukrainian and Russian origin, which are necessary for the feeding of the populations, as well as the functioning of the economies of the importing countries.@@@It is imperative that the United Nations intervene diligently and more firmly in order to extinguish this inferno, in full compliance with the rules of international law.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo supports the position of the African Union (AU) and calls on all parties to the conflict to follow the path of dialogue and law advocated by Africa, which has experience in managing security crises caused by armed groups in some of its States.@@@In that regard, the United Nations knows that my country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is the victim of an acute security crisis that has lasted more than 20 years in the east of its national territory.@@@Any honest, good-faith observer recognizes that this crisis is caused mainly by the greed triggered by its tremendous natural wealth and the power ambitions of some of its neighbours.@@@The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo recognize the role of the United Nations, the African Union, the African regional communities, the European Union and the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s bilateral external partners in curbing this recurring crisis.@@@We are grateful to them and pay tribute to the sacrifice of the valiant peacekeepers who have lost their lives on the front lines in defence of the ideals of peace and justice.@@@However, despite tireless internal efforts, the massive military presence of the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its diplomatic support for 23 years, the security problem continues to plague my country.@@@In order to definitively eradicate insecurity, restore lasting peace and ensure stability in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, several agreements have been signed with armed groups, and even with neighbouring countries, under the auspices of the international community.@@@National and international mechanisms have been created.@@@All of those prospects for a definitive resolution of the conflict lasted only a few months.@@@Soon, the architecture cracked, and the building collapsed.@@@And the same tragedies are happening all over again.@@@Since my election as Head of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I have never stopped fighting, every day, for peace and security in the provinces
of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu.@@@As part of a philosophy of reconciliation with our neighbours, I have spared no effort to reassure the Heads of State of neighbouring countries and to restore confidence among us, in particular through ongoing consultations on issues of common interest, the conclusion of security cooperation and economic partnership agreements and the implementation of development projects for our respective populations.@@@Despite my goodwill and the outstretched hand of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for peace, some of our neighbours have found no better way to thank us than through aggression and support for armed terrorist groups that are ravaging the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@That is currently the case for Rwanda, which, in defiance of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutive Act of the African Union, once again not only attacked the Democratic Republic of the Congo in March through direct incursions by its armed forces, the Rwanda Defence Force, but is also occupying localities in the province of North Kivu through an armed terrorist group, the Mouvement du 23 mars (M-23), to which it is providing massive support through materials for war and troops.@@@As if to defy the international community, the M-23, with the support of the Rwandan army, even shot down a helicopter belonging to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and killed eight peacekeepers, thereby committing a war crime.@@@In this emblematic place of international life, I fervently denounce this umpteenth aggression of which my country is victim at the hands of its neighbour, Rwanda, under the cover of a terrorist group called M-23.@@@Rwanda’s involvement and responsibility in the tragedy that my country and my compatriots are living through in the areas occupied by the Rwandan army and its M-23 allies are no longer refutable, since the groups of experts duly mandated by the United Nations and the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, as well as credible humanitarian and human rights non-governmental organizations, have established that involvement more than once in documented and objective reports that border on scientific proof.@@@Moreover, in order to enlighten the community of nations and to put an end to the endless denials of the Rwandan authorities on this subject, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterates its request to the President of the Security Council to officially distribute to the members of the Council the latest report of the United Nations experts on the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and to have it diligently examined by the Council in order to draw all the necessary consequences in terms of the law, peace and international security.@@@The image and credibility of our Organization are at stake.@@@To do otherwise would be, on the one hand, to encourage Rwanda to continue its aggression, its war crimes and its crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, on the other hand, to further fuel the legitimate suspicion of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with regard to the impartiality of the United Nations and the complicity of some of its members in these crimes.@@@It is in order to put an end to that suspicion and to dispel the ambiguity of certain positions of the Security Council on the security crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo — an ambiguity that is overwhelming the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and exacerbates the tension between it and the MONUSCO — that the Government of my country has requested a reassessment of the plan for the gradual and responsible withdrawal of the Mission.@@@This adjustment process is necessitated by the unanimous observation, even at the highest level of our Organization, of the regrettable weaknesses of MONUSCO, which undoubtedly affects the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Organization’s action in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@The reassessment of MONUSCO’s withdrawal plan cannot, therefore, in any way call into question the relations between my country and our Organization.@@@In any case, I reaffirm loud and clear at this rostrum of the highest international organ for the management of world affairs the determination of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its leaders to defend with their lives the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of their country — in full compliance, of course, with international law and of the commitments made within the international organizations of which it is a member.@@@I would like to make clear that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its civil society will never allow anyone to utilize the discourse of tribal, ethnic and racial hatred and xenophobia in our country.@@@The Constitution of the Republic and its laws prohibit such
speech and severely punish it.@@@No one can therefore use that fanciful discourse to justify criminal activities in the country, to divide the people or to weaken the national unity that all my compatriots hold dear.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo will never be genocidal.@@@Similarly, I maintain that the alleged collaboration of some officials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the Rwandan opponents of the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), which Rwandan leaders use to justify repeated aggression against the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is an alibi that is not corroborated by any proven fact on the ground.@@@The FDLR have been decapitated and reduced to nothing by the Forces armees de la Republique democratique du Congo (FARDC), in close collaboration with the Rwandan army, within the framework of joint operations carried out a few years ago.@@@Moreover, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has repatriated several FDLR elements and their families.@@@The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are therefore asking themselves — which FDLR are we talking about?@@@How many square metres of Rwandan territory are occupied by those phantom FDLR?@@@Where on Rwandan soil has a single soldier from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ever been seen?@@@Whatever the case, my country stands ready to take repressive action against any armed group that tries to disturb peace and security in a neighbouring country and in the Great Lakes region.@@@The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ask the United Nations, the African Union, the African regional communities and the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s partners to stop relying on the shameless denials of the Rwandan authorities and to contribute instead to the restoration of security, the building of lasting peace and the creation of the conditions necessary for fruitful cooperation in the Great Lakes region for the good of all.@@@For that purpose, it is necessary to, first, make effective the immediate withdrawal of the M-23 from the occupied localities, the return of the displaced people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from those localities to their homes and the unconditional cessation of the Rwandan army’s support to this terrorist group, in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Luanda road map, agreed between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, as well as successive declarations by the Security Council, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).@@@Secondly, we must bring more pressure to bear on Rwanda and the M-23, whose leaders are under United Nations sanctions, and to be firmer with them so that they respect the positions taken by the above-mentioned international organizations.@@@Thirdly, we must support the continuation of the Nairobi peace process, the Democratic Republic of the Congo-Rwanda Luanda discussions and the deployment of the East African regional force, whose statute and rules of engagement were signed on 8 September in Kinshasa by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the EAC Secretary General, on the one hand, and by the FARDC and the command of that regional force, on the other.@@@Fourthly, we must encourage the honorary President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, and the President of Angola, Joao Lourengo, mediators of the EAC and the AU in the security crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to continue their good offices.@@@Fifthly, we must remove all obstacles to efforts by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to restructure its armed forces and increase its strength in order to better fulfil its sovereign missions, notably through the pure and simple lifting of all restrictive measures on the acquisition of military equipment, whatever form they may take, as decreed by the Security Council.@@@The realization of the actions I have recommended here will undoubtedly guarantee the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo the certainty of a settlement of the crisis and will facilitate a constructive dialogue between all the parties concerned in that regard.@@@We, the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are determined this time to put a definitive end to the insecurity in the east of our country, whatever the cost.@@@The time has come to break forever the infernal cycle of violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to stabilize the Great Lakes region and take full advantage of its economic potential, as well as its rich biodiversity, to save humankind from climate change.@@@Carrying out those changes poses two fundamental problems, namely, the implementation of legal and financial instruments resulting from international
negotiations, in particular within the framework of the various Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the energy transition.@@@It is time, on the one hand, to put an end to the selective implementation of commitments made by polluters and, on the other hand, to compensate, in the name of climate justice, the efforts made by less-polluting countries, including those of Africa, in order to preserve the environment for the sake of our entire planet.@@@With regard to the energy transition, Africa has sufficient renewable energy sources and raw materials to help mobilize credible options for resolving the energy and environmental crises.@@@In that regard, it is important to note that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the primary producers of essential strategic minerals for the energy transition and the decarbonization of the transport sector.@@@These include cobalt, lithium, nickel and manganese.@@@My country has set itself the goal of ensuring the clean production of those metals.@@@With that in mind, on 29 April, the Republic of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed an agreement on the establishment of a value chain in the electric battery and clean energy sector.@@@Needless to say, given the size of the investment required to implement such a project, the involvement of partners is particularly essential, especially with regard to providing capital and the appropriate technology.@@@Furthermore, to support the green transformation agenda in economies on the African continent and meet the growing energy demand around the world, my country has opted to capitalize on its vast potential in renewable energy sources, including hydroelectricity, solar energy, geothermal energy and the exploitation of its gas deposits.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an asset as it pertains to implementing Agenda 2063 of the African Union, via the Grand Inga project, which could also be beneficial for parts of Europe and the Middle East.@@@In that regard, we are delighted to host the preparatory work for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate, which will take place in Kinshasa next month.@@@I take this opportunity to shed light on the environmental aspects of the tender issued by my country, on 28 July, for the exploration of 27 oil blocks and three gas blocks.@@@The tender has been met with unnecessary controversy in the international arena.@@@It should be recalled that no relevant international legal instrument ratified by the Democratic Republic of the Congo prohibits our country from exploiting its natural resources for the purpose of protecting the environment or due to fears about accelerating global warming.@@@The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change acknowledges that developing countries are within their right to emit carbon dioxide for their development purposes, while taking steps to protect the global climate through their nationally determined contributions.@@@The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has therefore set itself the goal of exploiting the country’s natural resources, while respecting environmental standards, and processing them locally to provide added value and boost the national economy, including by creating liquid wealth and jobs to improve the living conditions for the Congolese population.@@@The appropriate strategies and measures have been adopted and implemented to avoid negative impacts on the environment.@@@Following the example of other countries in Africa and Europe that have overcome that challenge, measures include effective Government checks and balances.@@@This will allow the Democratic Republic of the Congo to achieve its economic and social objectives, while protecting its forests and remaining the country with solutions in the fight against global warming.@@@My country remains open to cooperation with any partner wishing to help it achieve its goals.@@@On the economic front, the challenge to be met is that of helping to revive the economies of countries that have been weakened by the collateral effects of climate change and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in order to promote balanced global economic growth and halt the spread of poverty in developing countries.@@@We cannot overcome that challenge without good internal governance efforts at the national level, productive investment or sufficient and real transfers of financial resources to those who need them.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo therefore calls for the implementation of the proposal that rich countries cede a percentage of their special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund to least developed countries.@@@The proposal was made by the Paris Conference on post COVID-19 economic recovery, held in May 2021, and endorsed by a firm commitment from the Group of 20 in Rome in October 2021.@@@In any event,
any facility that provides access to additional resources for those countries sorely tested by climate change and COVID-19 would be welcome.@@@Similarly, alleviating the debt burden of low- income countries must remain an ongoing concern to be included in a global approach to international solidarity.@@@For its part, despite the difficult global economic situation following the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has made significant progress with respect to economic growth.@@@Wealth creation accelerated in 2021, thanks in particular to positive momentum in the mining sector.@@@Production in that sector increased to 10.1 per cent in 2021 from 1 per cent in 2019, due to favourable copper and cobalt prices on the international market.@@@Inflation rates and the exchange rate of the Congolese franc have remained relatively stable.@@@The Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund conducted the second review under the Extended Credit Facility arrangement.@@@The International Monetary Fund commended the prudent macroeconomic policies adopted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@We will tirelessly pursue those policies and efforts to improve the business climate so as to boost private investment and overall economic activity.
Solidarity and justice in relations among countries have always been factors in achieving mutual peace and security, as they bring people together and create interconnectedness among them.@@@Therefore, combating poverty and promoting collective well-being are powerful bulwarks against social conflict and tensions among peoples.@@@For that reason, the Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes the collective action of the international community against COVID-19 and commends the Feed the Future initiative of the United States of America to fund agriculture to combat the hunger and food insecurity in Africa caused by the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.@@@My country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of the African beneficiaries of that initiative, to mention just the most recent example.@@@My country calls for similar actions and initiatives that help not only to resolve issues related to everyday life and to create jobs for the greatest number of people, but also with income distribution and purchasing power.@@@However, in the name of international solidarity and justice, we have questions about the maintenance of sanctions against the people of Zimbabwe that date back to the time of the late President Robert Mugabe.@@@Why is our Organization so silent and indifferent to that injustice, bordering on a crime, against an innocent people?@@@As the current Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community, I urgently call on the United Nations to do everything possible to obtain the immediate lifting of the sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe and its people.@@@In this multipolar world, no country, however powerful and rich it may be, can hope to overcome alone the challenges I have just outlined, let alone resolve them in the interests of one and all.@@@The importance of the issues at stake, the complexity of the problems to be solved and the magnitude of the task require an equitable multilateral approach that takes all interests into account and pools all energies in mutual respect.@@@This is why the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to believe that it is essential to better structure and enrich multilateralism, with equal treatment for all stakeholders, in order to create the spaces for dialogue and cooperation that we need to ensure international peace and security.@@@That is the United Nations we want.@@@To that end, we must act urgently to reform of the United Nations, which appears to be stalled at the moment.@@@In that context, I must insist on the need to satisfy Africa’s legitimate and just demand to be represented on the Security Council with two additional seats in the category of non-permanent membership and two others in the category of permanent membership with the same rights, including that of veto, privileges and obligations as those of the current permanent members.@@@It is a question of justice for a continent — or rather, to an entire swath of humankind — whose role is increasing every day in the conduct of international affairs.@@@We Africans are firmly attached to that.@@@In conclusion, allow me to say a few words about gender parity.@@@In that regard, it is necessary to stress the efforts under way both at the international level and at the level of States to create spaces for gender equality and opportunities for freedom and action for women.@@@To do so, the involvement of men in gender-promotion policies is necessary because, on the one hand, men share their lives with women and, on the other hand, since time immemorial and for various reasons, men have established a pre-eminence over women that gives them a determining influence over their destiny.@@@We must put an end to that de facto situation.@@@For that reason, during my term of office at the helm of the African Union, I initiated a meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the continental organization under the theme of “Men’s Conference on Positive Masculinity”.@@@That historic meeting, held in Kinshasa in 2021, led to a declaration of the African Union containing the commitments of men, in particular that of the Heads of State and Government, to put an end to violence against women and girls and to provide appropriate responses to that issue.@@@The declaration constitutes a veritable African Union charter for women that I am working to bring to fruition in my capacity as an African Union champion for positive masculinity.@@@In that context, I have worked to further promote Congolese women, who today are increasingly at the forefront of public affairs management within the political, legal and administrative institutions of my country.@@@That proactive policy should allow in the future for radical change, not only in the perception of women and their role in society, but also in women taking charge of their own destinies.@@@Indeed, parity is not a gift to women, but a responsibility that they must assume.@@@I wish every success to the work of the seventy- seventh regular session of the General Assembly.@@@Please accept my warmest greetings and congratulations on the election of His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I commit my delegation’s full support and cooperation to him in the fulfilment of his important duties.@@@I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives, for his able guidance of the Assembly at its previous session.@@@I am extremely honoured to be speaking for the first time at this important global forum on behalf of the Government and people of Grenada.@@@Exactly three months ago today, the people of Grenada exercised their democratic right and voted for transformation.@@@In free and fair elections and through a solid mandate at the polls, the Grenadian people placed their confidence in me to lead our country for the next five years.@@@Today I bring my transformational agenda to the General Assembly because, although we are an island State, our world does not exist in isolation.@@@Successful and sustainable transformation in Grenada is inevitably tethered to the sustainable forward movement of the global community.@@@This noble institution is nearing its 80-year anniversary, a significant milestone that is worthy of distinct recognition.@@@As my own country also draws near to a noteworthy milestone, that of 50 years as an independent State, it is an appropriate time to renew our commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to international law.@@@It is also a fitting time to review the achievements of the past decades and proffer solutions to the challenges that have stymied progress.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought our world to a standstill, without prejudice for the size and economic might of nations.@@@For a time, this disease was the great equalizer and forced us all to re-evaluate our priorities and our approach to working together.@@@Grenada notes with relief news from the World Health Organization that we might finally be entering the end phase of the pandemic.@@@While we welcome the return to some semblance of normal, it is my sincere hope that the lessons learned from the pandemic will remain and that we will not return to business as usual.@@@The monumental challenges posed by the pandemic were unprecedented and seemingly insurmountable.@@@Amid this worldwide disaster, however, our global community rallied and demonstrated what is possible when we resolve to work together towards a common goal.@@@The pandemic taught us all the value of international cooperation, the timely exchange of information and the sharing of resources critical to avoiding and mitigating similar global occurrences.@@@It is imperative that the matter of climate change be escalated to this level of urgency among our community of nations.@@@The devastating effects of global warming can already be felt all over the world, with higher temperatures exacerbating many types of disasters, including storms, heat waves, floods and droughts.@@@Our planet is undoubtedly in crisis, but as the ancient Chinese proverb reminds us, “crisis is opportunity riding a dangerous wind.”@@@This window of opportunity is quickly closing, however, and we no longer have the luxury to kick these issues down the road.@@@We are now faced with the reality that tomorrow is today.@@@We have tinkered long enough and must now accept that the solutions to the problems we face may not be found in this grand Hall or in the highest echelons of global climate discussions, but rather with the people, especially our young people, who stand to lose the most from the inaction of our current leaders.@@@Approximately 60 per cent of the world’s population is under 35 years old.@@@In my own country, 50 per cent of the current population is between 18 and 35 years of age.@@@Young people are therefore critical to the success of sustainable development policies and must play a central role in the implementation of the targets set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and sustaining peace.@@@I call on all young people to take action.@@@It is not yet too late to do what is necessary to safeguard our planet for future generations, but the time for action is now.@@@The reality is that the leaders of today will not be around to feel the consequences of their decisions.@@@It is therefore up to our youth to lead the charge for the future they want to see.@@@I challenge all young people today to choose to be agents of change rather than victims of climate change.@@@It can start with small actions that cause ripple effects throughout their families and friend circles, their communities and, eventually, the wider world.@@@It was not that long ago that I, too, was a young lawyer, seeking to evoke positive change in my community through small actions.@@@I knew that I could no longer sit on the sidelines and wait for the leaders of the day to solve challenges that had plagued Grenadian society for well over a decade.@@@I had to become the change.@@@In October 2021,1 made the decision to enter political life and, shortly after, was elected as the political leader of the National Democratic Congress.@@@Only eight months later, I led the party to victory, winning nine of 15 seats.@@@My presence here today is testament that we can create the change that we would like to see, but it will materialize only if we step forward and accept the call to be the leaders of today.@@@As leaders, the onus is also on us to create spaces where young people feel empowered to propose innovative solutions to the challenges we collectively face.@@@That is a priority of my Administration and has been backed by gender-forward, pro-youth policies and purposeful action.@@@The appointment of the Honourable Kerryne James as Minister for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy, at 23 years of age, is a milestone for my country and the Caribbean region, as Ms. James is the youngest Government minister in the Caribbean.@@@Confronting the climate crisis will require a complete transformation of our mindset and behaviours but also, and importantly, the transformation of our energy sources, economic models and land stewardship.@@@This is a unique opportunity to come together, welcome innovative ideas and tackle the problems we have struggled with for generations.@@@Our goal as responsible global citizens should be to leave the planet as good as or better than we found it.@@@This plea is not without urgency.@@@As the leader of a Caribbean small island developing State, I am all too familiar with the devastating effects of climate change and the stark reality that — in the face of increasingly strengthened hurricanes and sea-level rise — we may not have a country to pass on to future generations .@@@The small island States of the Caribbean are already experiencing significant adverse effects due to climate change.@@@With every hurricane season — and we are currently in hurricane season — that now brings increased and more powerful storms, we watch and wait, with bated breath and a silent prayer, in the hope that this year it will not be our turn.@@@In 2004, it was Grenada’s turn, with Hurricane Ivan.@@@In a mere eight hours we lost 34 souls.@@@The Category 3 storm destroyed 80 per cent of our housing stock and decimated our economic and fiscal bases, with damage exceeding 200 per cent of our gross domestic product.@@@Ten months later, in 2005, it was Grenada’s turn again, with Hurricane Emily.@@@In recent years, we have watched with horror as our brothers and sisters across the Caribbean experienced their turn, most notably with Hurricane Irma in 2017, which left the island of Barbuda nearly uninhabitable and wrought significant havoc on at least 10 other Caribbean island States, including the British Virgin Islands, which lost approximately 85 per cent of its housing stock.@@@Then, only two weeks later, Hurricane Maria cruelly threatened to exacerbate the wounds freshly inflicted by Irma.@@@And the global community will surely remember the destruction Hurricane Maria visited on Dominica, leaving 31 people dead and 37 missing, as well as causing an estimated $930.9 million in damages.@@@I could continue in this vein, highlighting the devastating consequences that Caribbean islands suffer owing to the warming climate, including the harmful effects on our rich biodiversity and underwater resources.@@@We are truly on the front lines and know all too well the ease with which one hurricane can wipe out decades of progress.@@@As I stand here this morning, several Caribbean islands are reeling from the wrath of Hurricane Fiona.@@@That is the reality we face, and why it is urgent that we act.@@@Given the focus of my address here today, it is evident that climate change is inimical to Grenada’s transformational agenda.@@@We continue to insist on a clear road map at the global level for ambitious climate action in order to ensure that global average temperatures remain below the 1.5°C threshold.@@@As we seek to bolster climate resilience in our island home, I reiterate the call for us all to urgently scale up climate financing for adaptation and remove the challenges that developing nations face in accessing such financing.@@@In additional, my Government calls for increased technology development and capacity-building, especially for young people.@@@We are encouraged and indeed proud that a son of the soil has been given the responsibility to manage global climate action.@@@The appointment of Simon Stiell as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat sends a clear message about the importance of island voices in the fight against climate change.@@@We are optimistic that we will achieve the mandates of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and its protocols, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The Government of Grenada is steadfast in its commitment to creating paths towards sustainability and promoting diversity.@@@Evidence of our resolve can be found in Grenada’s first ever long-term national sustainable development plan for the period from 2020 to 2035 in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is the anchor for our country’s development agenda and priorities for the next 15-year period.@@@In that regard, the Government of Grenada is pleased to be one of the 45 countries that presented voluntary national reviews of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development during the recently held High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.@@@Our country-led review of progress towards the implementation of the 17 SDGs of the 2030 Agenda comes at a critical juncture in our collective efforts aimed at recovering from the extraordinary socioeconomic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@For Grenada, the pandemic exposed critical structural weaknesses and resource deficiencies in our health-care system.@@@Managing the high incidence of non-communicable diseases is therefore an urgent priority, and so too is addressing the mental health of our citizens.@@@In addition, the economic fallout from the worldwide closure of borders and the stagnation of tourism — a key economic driver — has exacerbated already elevated levels of unemployment and poverty.@@@My Government intends to mitigate those dire circumstances in the future by diversifying our economy and developing a robust information and communications technology-based digital economy.@@@Trends such as converging technologies and the digitalization of production are rapidly transforming work and life, and they must be factored into training and development opportunities for our young people.@@@We understand that if we are to adequately equip our young people for the future, inclusive and equitable quality education is fundamental.@@@To that end, my Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure its framework for free universal education up to the community-college level, and is committed to providing second-chance opportunities to all young people who do not complete a primary, secondary or tertiary education.@@@Additionally, we intend to actively seek out opportunities for further studies in the digital and creative fields to support our emerging creative and digital economies.@@@The answers will once again lie with our young people and their invaluable contributions to the future of the labour force.@@@My Government will foster an environment where young people have access to the support and facilities they need to thrive.@@@In particular, we intend to provide incentives to young entrepreneurs, upgrade our agriculture productions systems and bolster our export capacity.@@@Grenada will act deliberately to attract the attention and support of the international community and the favour of friendly nations as we seek to improve the standard of living of all of our citizens through the exploration of new frontiers of economic and social development.@@@As we emerge from the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and optimistically prepare to transform our economy, we cannot ignore the new crisis in the East that has emerged from current geopolitical tensions and conflicts, with devastating and disruptive consequences for energy and food security.@@@Russia’s war with Ukraine has already threatened international peace and stability and created hardships for nations unconnected with the conflict.@@@Grenada associates itself with the call of many for Russia to relent in its war making in Ukraine and for the parties to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the conflict.@@@Mindful that peace is a supreme asset and a legitimate aspiration of all peoples, Grenada renews its firm call for the Caribbean to remain a zone of peace.@@@We also advocate for the economic, social and environmental development of all Caribbean States.@@@In that regard, Grenada is satisfied that the removal of the United States-imposed economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba will facilitate economic and social change there.@@@Additionally, we call for Cuba to be removed from the United States State Department’s list of countries that are sponsors of terrorism.@@@In the same way, we lament that more has not been done for our brothers and sisters in Haiti, a country classified as one of poorest amongst us.@@@The Caribbean Community continues to pursue various initiatives to assist Haiti.@@@However, we believe that more productive engagements must be undertaken with all stakeholders to help achieve political stability, peace and economic progress in Haiti.@@@Grenada also reiterates its support for the ongoing judicial process at the International Court of Justice aimed at bringing a definitive end to the long-standing
Guyana/Venezuela border dispute, and we reaffirm our unwavering support for the territorial integrity of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.@@@We further remain resolute in our call for an end to the imposition of unilateral coercive measures against the Republic of Venezuela, contrary to the rules and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The net effect of the recent and ongoing crises continues to seriously dislodge the world economy and, in turn, the ability of countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The adverse impacts on production, employment and poverty are growing, while at the same time jeopardizing fiscal management in many countries.@@@The Government of Grenada is firm in its determination to achieve the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We call, however, for the increased inclusion of youth voices as we seek to chart the future of our planet.@@@We further note that if small island States are to eliminate poverty and attain sustainable levels of development, the vulnerability criteria now applicable to our countries must be comprehensively reviewed as a matter of urgency.@@@The consequence of upper middle-income status afforded Grenada and many other small States, without consideration of our specific vulnerabilities, continues to hinder our ability to access concessionary and grant financing.@@@We continue to call for a new multidimensional vulnerability index, which would eliminate the threat to our economic development and security, and we encourage the submission of additional proposals that seek to address similar challenges that prevent our countries from moving forward on an equal footing.@@@The United Nations system over the past 77 years has contributed immensely to humankind.@@@It is now time to consider strategic transformation if we are to achieve the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda and safeguard our planet for future generations.@@@I am honoured to represent Sri Lanka at the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, which after two years brings together world leaders post-pandemic in this Hall in person.@@@Permit me the honour of congratulating His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on being elected President of the General Assembly at its current session.@@@Sri Lanka looks forward to working closely with him and his team in the year ahead.@@@May I also convey our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives for his excellent stewardship of the seventy-sixth session.@@@As a close friend and neighbour of Maldives, we express particular appreciation for his presidency of hope, which gave us renewed optimism and vigour.@@@Building on that, we move to the vision of our new President of finding solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science.@@@Seventy-seven years ago, when the battlefields of the Second World War had fallen silent but their horrors reverberated around the globe, a new world order emerged out of the remains of the old one.@@@And that new world order was manifested by the Charter of the United Nations, developed by 50 nations at the San Francisco Conference.@@@The United Nations is a table at which every State can sit down, a forum where everyone can be heard and where everyone is equally important.@@@That is the concept of multilateralism, and it is a fundamental political principle of diplomacy.@@@It is said that multilateral diplomacy is similar to gardening — you plant, you wait, you sow the seeds, you wait, you trim and you harvest at some point.@@@In multilateralism, we talk to each other, we develop a relationship of trust and confidence and, if something were to come up, you have the base to work from.@@@The world is facing a multiplicity of complex, interlocking challenges.@@@The far-reaching effects of the pandemic have been further exacerbated by the current global crises.@@@Those vulnerabilities have been aggravated by the devastating consequences of what the Secretary-General has referred to as a “five-alarm global fire”, which has resulted, inter alia, in the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and rising pollution.@@@We are, in addition, witnessing extreme weather patterns resulting in loss of life, property and habitat, involuntary human displacement and an accompanying food and energy crisis.@@@It is not difficult to imagine that these trends can lead to deepening inequalities, both within and among States.@@@Developing countries and their economies are at extreme risk, with Governments facing debt default and financial collapse due to lack of access to adequate capital, while people face rising poverty, unemployment and hunger.@@@As a consequence, nutrition levels, especially among children, are being affected and their education and intellectual advancement disrupted.@@@Despite our best efforts, our collective ability to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or even to sustain the gains already achieved is becoming increasingly difficult.@@@It is against that challenging global backdrop that significant changes have taken place in Sri Lanka since the last session of the General Assembly.@@@The external and internal challenges we face provide an opportunity for implementing political, social and economic reforms that will lead to recovery and prosperity for our people.@@@Sri Lanka believes that this is the moment to realize our collective vision for the future — an opportunity to build a more just, sustainable and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans, and to build back better.@@@We look forward to the cooperation and support of the international community, including the United Nations, as we embark on that journey.@@@Following prolonged social unrest and protests in the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his maiden speech in Parliament last month stated: “I will implement the social and political reforms requested by the nation”.@@@Those measures include a review of the present procedures, the strengthening of the institutional framework of democratic governance and the adoption of urgent measures to restore long-term economic stability.@@@We have understood that this will be possible only if we engage in strict adherence to fiscal discipline and far-reaching economic and institutional reforms.@@@We are committed to that process.@@@It is envisaged that through the proposed legislative and constitutional amendments, democratic governance will be reinforced with independent oversight institutions and enhanced public scrutiny.@@@Legal and administrative frameworks are being strengthened to ensure transparency, integrity, accountability and inclusivity in providing access to justice.@@@A greater participation of women and youth will be ensured in this process.@@@We remain cognizant of and acutely sensitive to the events that have taken place in the recent past.@@@The Government is extremely sensitive to the socioeconomic hardships faced by our people.@@@We are pleased to have reached a staff-level understanding with the International Monetary Fund.@@@We have put in place measures to protect the vulnerable segments of society and will endeavour to ensure that these economic reforms have a minimum impact on their lives.@@@Our institutions and society have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of very difficult circumstances.@@@We unconditionally recognize the fact that one has a fundamental right to the freedom of expression, which we all treat as sacrosanct.@@@However, it must also be appreciated that this freedom must fall within the constitutional order and be exercised having regard to one’s fundamental duty to express oneself within the confines of the law.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Sri Lanka’s nationwide strategy in containing the human health impact of the coronavirus disease has
been largely successful as a result of proactive and non-discriminatory measures by the Government and the effective delivery capabilities of our strong healthcare infrastructure.@@@Our vaccination drive exceeded World Health Organization targets.@@@However, as a developing country we were highly vulnerable to the economic fallout of the pandemic.@@@The virus has opened a window to the future that we must exploit, highlighting the importance of multilateral cooperation through global health networks.@@@Permit me to briefly turn to the aspect of climate change.@@@As Sri Lanka is a climate-vulnerable country, climate change has had the potential to adversely impact our socioeconomic progress, as well as food security and livelihoods.@@@Sri Lanka has pledged to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and our updated nationally determined contributions (NDC), submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change last year with the aim of reducing emissions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.@@@We firmly believe that those commitments should not adversely impact the green economic development objectives.@@@We also appreciate that meeting the NDC targets and executing the corresponding energy transition towards renewable and sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures will require significant climate financing.@@@Members will appreciate that we cannot do that alone.@@@We believe that in tandem with our own efforts, the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases must fulfil their commitments and assist developing nations in adaptation and mitigation measures under a common but differentiated framework.@@@We need to work towards a just, sustainable, resilient and inclusive recovery from the adverse impacts of climate change and the energy transition.@@@Turning to the ocean, members will appreciate that as an island nation, we are acutely concerned about and sensitive to the impact of pollution and climate change on the oceans.@@@With rapidly growing pressure on land resources, the world is turning towards the oceans for sustenance, not only for food security but also as a source of raw materials for industries and energy.@@@We are committed to the sustainable use of the oceans and its resources in consonance with SDG 14.@@@In the General Assembly in May, we were pleased to have led a small but significant nature-based solution to mitigate the impact of climate change that led to the United Nations declaring 1 March as World Seagrass Day.@@@Seagrasses are an important carbon sink and absorb significantly more carbon than tropical rain forests.@@@There is a likelihood that the world will not reach the scheduled milestones to achieve zero hunger by 2030.@@@It is predicted that food and nutrition security will be at great risk.@@@Sri Lanka is paying serious heed to those warning signs.@@@Sri Lanka supports the sustainable transformation of agriculture to a modernized sector and encourages enhanced food production to ensure food security.@@@Sri Lanka has initiated the national food security programme with the dual objectives of ensuring that no citizen should suffer for the want of food and no child should be a victim of malnutrition.@@@Adequate nutrition is a sine qua non and vital to ensuring that children of all socioeconomic backgrounds can enjoy good health.@@@The provision of quality education and health care for all is at the core of Sri Lanka’s social protection policies and provided the foundation upon which Sri Lanka was able to mitigate the effects of the global learning crisis during the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@Rapid conversions to digital systems for the delivery of education threatened universal access, participation and survival in the education system, especially among children of low- income households.@@@Sri Lanka aims to bridge the digital divide and ensure that no child will be left behind.@@@Despite severe challenges, we will endeavour to maintain the significant progress we have made towards achieving the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.@@@Our efforts have placed us in a leading position in the Asia-Pacific region for SDG data availability, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka’s capacity for evidence-informed policymaking for the SDGs in future.@@@We recognize that investment in human capital is indispensable to the future of our country.@@@It is no surprise that Sri Lanka is ranked high in the human development category, occupying rank 73 out of 191 countries globally, and is the highest in the region.@@@Having said that, we are nonetheless concerned that current challenges have disrupted progress.@@@The Secretary-General has in, a serious warning, made reference to rescuing the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@That warning has been followed by an observation by the United Nations Development Programme, that for the first time in 32 years, the Human Development Index has declined globally for two years consecutively.@@@Let me say a word about global security.@@@Geopolitical tensions among nations have heightened,
creating insecurity and polarization among States.@@@Agreed frameworks for arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament have become fragile.@@@At the recently concluded tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which remains the centrepiece of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, we were regrettably unable to arrive once again at a consensus outcome.@@@While we address contemporary challenges, we must not forget the lingering issue of Palestine.@@@While restating Sri Lanka’s consistent and principled position that the Palestinian people have a legitimate and inalienable right to the natural resources in their territory and to statehood, we further recognize the legitimate security concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples, and an urgent resolution of the matter, on the basis of United Nations resolutions on the attainment of the two-State solution, needs to be pursued immediately.@@@The absence of a regulatory supervisory regime concerning the use of new technologies in cyberspace and in artificial intelligence needs to be addressed urgently.@@@Their ability to cause large-scale disruption, spread disinformation and undermine scientifically established findings is of real concern and a danger we all face.@@@Sri Lanka, which is implementing the nation’s first information and cybersecurity strategy, has identified the importance of establishing a partnership- based approach to protecting cyberspace in order to confront multinational cyberthreats.@@@I must make a brief reference to the scourge of terrorism.@@@Sri Lanka was a victim of terrorism for several decades.@@@Terrorists’ choice of targets, methods of financing and radicalization, as well as the use of new technologies as weapons, have been constantly evolving.@@@Legislative measures and law enforcement mechanisms must be put in place to counter radical ideologies leading to violent extremism and to curb the terrorists’ use and abuse of the internet and social media platforms.@@@At the same time, it is necessary to develop the critical thinking capacity of youth, strengthen community bonds, foster a sense of civic responsibility, and build community resilience to mitigate the effects and influences of violent extremist ideology leading to terrorism.@@@As our contribution to maintaining international peace and security, Sri Lanka looks forward to enhancing our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations with professional men and women to serve as peacekeepers.@@@I take this opportunity to honour the thousands of men and women who, for decades, have helped countries navigate the difficult path from conflict to peace under the Blue Helmet.@@@We have taken many measures to ensure that Sri Lankan peacekeepers, with a wealth of experience in counterterrorism and counter insurgency operations, are trained and equipped with theoretical and practical knowledge of all necessary functions of peacekeeping, including the promotion and protection of human rights.@@@This is indeed a watershed moment for the international community — a moment of great challenge and opportunity.@@@The complex and interconnected crises that we face cannot be resolved by nations acting on their own.@@@This is an opportunity to demonstrate global solidarity, diplomacy and collective efforts, leveraging the ideas and talents of all of our people and all segments of our society to find transformative solutions that leave no one behind.@@@Multilateralism is a tool for diplomacy that rises above such challenges.@@@Conflicts, disasters and crises will not stop at passport control.@@@Multilateralism is not without its shortcomings, but undoubtedly it provides a solid framework for resolving contemporary challenges.@@@This, I would say, is the mission of the Assembly, and perhaps the singular reason for which it was established 77 years ago.@@@And that perhaps is the reason why Sri Lanka and many others applied to be Members — to participate, to be visible, to be heard and to embellish the Organization with our own flavours, perspectives, history and knowledge, adding to this fine amalgam and growing from the common work discussions and disputes that we take issue with.@@@I wind up by citing the observations of one of our late Prime Ministers, who committed Sri Lanka to the way of a socialist democracy, to non-alignment and to an independent foreign policy based on friendship with all countries, irrespective of differing ideological and social systems, when he said:
“We have to build up a new society for ourselves; one, as I have said, which best suits the genius of our country.@@@We should like to get some ideas and principles from this side, and some from the other, until a coherent form of society is made up that suits our people, in the context of a changing
world today.@@@That is why we do not range ourselves on the side of this power bloc or that.”@@@Permit me to make the observation that the 193 nations represented here jointly share the responsibility to establish justice, maintain peace and ensure progress in a world that is in trouble as never before.@@@We have a Charter and a formidable body of international law, inclusive of our supreme law of the Constitution of the Republic and other local statutes.@@@We are acutely conscious of the fact that, notwithstanding all these sophistications, multipronged challenges remain.@@@The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to overcoming these challenges.@@@It is to that commitment that Sri Lanka pledges itself today, in the sincere hope that we will exploit the crisis that is at hand, build back better, leaving no one behind, and rise to new horizons of freedom and progress.@@@At the outset, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session and wish you every success in presiding over its work.@@@The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a delicate historic time.@@@The international arena is witnessing intertwined crises of immense complexity, requiring concerted action to invigorate multilateralism, including, first and foremost, the United Nations system.@@@As the world still suffers from the colossal consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, successive geopolitical crises have raised international tensions to unprecedented levels.@@@In the light of those delicate circumstances, Egypt would like to reflect on the current international landscape, the challenges faced by our world today and the means to confront them.@@@First, the United Nations system still faces the challenge of acting outside its working context.@@@That undermines its capacity to take an effective international stance that supports the maintenance of international security and stability and promotes the development and prosperity of peoples of the world.@@@It is unfortunate that our hopes have been dashed in terms of achieving, in the twenty-first century, a world of stability and renouncing tensions while establishing international systems based on respect for international law.@@@Instead, we are surprised by a growing tendency towards polarization and confrontation rather than achieving complementarity to realize our common interests, or even to compete on the basis of justice leading to human advancement.@@@The United Nations system is further threatened by the use of double standards in dealing with similar crises even when acting outside its working context.@@@What is an acceptable response for one crisis is considered rejected for another.@@@Therefore, the flaws we are witnessing are not a feature of the United Nations system itself, but they reflect the will of certain members in the system.@@@As we meet in September of every year in this international forum, I call on all those gathered here to respect the United Nations system, with a view to reinvigorating and reforming it.@@@That process should not remain incomplete.@@@Instead, it should be addressed
seriously, objectively and fairly so that the United Nations can better respond to the challenges we face and become more flexible in meeting the demands and needs of our peoples.@@@In that regard, Egypt reiterates its adherence to the African common position calling for reform of the Security Council, based on the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.@@@The Russian-Ukrainian crisis has further exacerbated the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The pandemic’s negative impact, coupled with successive geopolitical developments, has increased the burdens on the developing countries, especially pertaining to the sovereign debt crisis and soaring budget deficits.@@@Developed countries therefore need to respond by launching a global initiative between creditor and debtor nations, to transform the bulk of debt into joint investment projects.@@@That would create more job opportunities and contribute to economic growth.@@@The current international situation clearly indicates that the concept of international security is now closer to a system of balance of power than one of collective security.@@@The international environment has been characterized by conflicts, not cooperation.@@@We must therefore work to promote the spirit of international consensus to ensure the security of all States, without threatening or undermining each other’s security and safety.@@@The current global challenges have threatened the very notion of the nation-State, interfering in its internal affairs and disrespecting the unique features of its society.@@@They weaken the State entity and, at times, even disrupt it, which enables non-State actors such as terrorist groups and armed militias to control the fate and wealth of peoples.@@@The nation-State and its institutions must be empowered to play their role at all levels to preserve and promote international peace and security.@@@There are many complex and intertwined challenges on the international scene with multiple repercussions, most notably the food security crisis, which is the result of the international community’s failure, over many years, to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, particularly the Goal seeking to eradicate hunger and achieve food security.@@@In addition, the crisis has been exacerbated by the recent economic and geopolitical crises.@@@Regrettably, in Africa alone, one in five people are at risk of hunger and the continent remains a net food importer, at an annual cost of $43 billion.@@@We reiterate the need to confront the global food crisis by establishing an integrated strategy that addresses its root causes through developing sustainable farming and agricultural systems and meeting the urgent needs of food-importing developing countries.@@@We also must ensure that their products have unimpeded access to the global supply chain, particularly through the development and transfer of agricultural technology.@@@We also stress the importance of supporting early warning systems regarding food insecurity and promoting grain storage and exports.@@@In that context, thanks to its unique geographical location, Egypt declares its readiness to cooperate with the international community to establish an international centre for storing, supplying and trading grains in Egypt, which will contribute to maintaining global food security.@@@The current session of the General Assembly is taking place under a theme that reflects our deep understanding of the crises and challenges the world is facing today.@@@There is no doubt that the search for radical solutions to those interlocking crises is most applicable to the climate change crisis.@@@Egypt, in its capacity as President of the upcoming twenty-seventh session of the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), appeals sincerely to all members of the international community to translate our pledges and commitments into action and to support developing and least developed countries in their efforts to confront the devastating impacts of climate change.@@@They are the most deserving and in need of such support on the basis of the principles of equity and common yet differentiated responsibilities.@@@During COP 27, which Egypt will host in a few weeks’ time, we look forward to reaching outcomes that contribute to accelerating the pace of implementation at all levels, consolidating the international community’s commitment to addressing climate change, including through emissions reduction, enhancing adaptation and tackling losses and damage due to climate change and, most important, raising climate financing ambitions.@@@We must also commit to double adaptation financing and ensure $100 billion annually, as well as working towards a just transition to renewable energy.@@@The international community’s ability to move forward on implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, especially limiting the rise in global temperature, is closely linked to the achievement of tangible outcomes in Sharm El-Sheikh conference.@@@That will demonstrate to our peoples that confronting climate change remains a top priority at the global level, among all other challenges that confront today’s world.@@@In that context, Egypt reaffirms its steadfast commitment to providing all favourable conditions to that end.@@@Water security remains one of the most important challenges facing our world today, especially in the Middle East and the African continent, where some countries are located in the driest and most arid areas in the world.@@@Unfortunately, that grave human suffering is not always due to a lack of resources or declining rainfall, but often to non-compliance with international law and to certain upstream countries monopolizing water resources and depriving downstream countries of the water that flows for the common good of all peoples.@@@Those who believe that resorting to peaceful means to settle water disputes is a form of weakness are mistaken.@@@Such an approach is rooted in the strength and ability to protect and preserve the rights from loss or alienation.@@@It is also based on a keen awareness by Governments of the negative impacts of conflict on people.@@@In that context, after a decade of self-restraint, Egypt still recognizes the right of the Ethiopian people to development.@@@However, that cannot be at the expense of the Egyptian people’s right to life and survival, which has been linked to the Nile River since the dawn of time.@@@I reiterate the need to reach, without delay, a legally binding agreement regarding the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in accordance with the Agreement on Declaration of Principles concluded by Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia in March 2015 in Khartoum and the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 15 September 2021 (S/PRST/2021/18).@@@As three sovereign States, they must respect what they agreed upon and implement their agreement through deeds, not just words, in order to maintain international peace and security.@@@Egypt therefore calls on the international community, represented by the United Nations and the Security Council, as well as influential States at the international level, to implement international law in order to safeguard the rights and lives of 250 million Egyptian, Sudanese and Ethiopian citizens.@@@Reaching definitive solutions to the crises in our region remains an essential pillar of building a secure and stable international system.@@@At the forefront of that is the need to reach a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question, through negotiations on the basis of resolutions of international legitimacy and the two-State solution, in order to establish a Palestinian State along the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@Meanwhile, it is essential to refrain from any unilateral measures that would change the facts on the ground and undermine prospects for an ultimate solution.@@@Based on Egypt’s responsibility to support its brothers, we continue to support efforts to reach political solutions, in accordance with international terms of reference, in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Sudan in a manner that preserves the unity, integrity and sovereignty of those brotherly countries and puts an end to any external interference in their affairs.@@@Egypt continues to support the efforts of our brothers in Libya to establish the constitutional framework to allow for the simultaneous holding of presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as possible and ending the transitional period.@@@In that regard, Egypt commends the role of the elected Libyan Parliament and stresses the importance of the withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya, as well as the dismantling of armed militias within a specific time frame, in order to restore long-desired stability in Libya.@@@Our region has suffered for a long time, and it is high time to overcome the suffering, to prioritize peoples’ interests over personal ones that seek power and wealth and to end attempts to undermine our region’s unity and national security.@@@Before concluding, I would like to note in particular the importance of solidarity as a fundamental value of which we are in dire need, now more than ever before.@@@The designation by the United Nations of 20 December as the annual International Human Solidarity Day reflects the importance of initiatives to eradicate poverty and celebrate unity in the context of diversity.@@@It is also an indication that the United Nations believes in solidarity as an indispensable value, not only to effectively achieve the Sustainable Development Goals but also to counter emerging challenges and address economic gaps.@@@Solidarity remains a source of hope for a better tomorrow.@@@That tomorrow cannot be achieved unless we all act together, hand in hand, to build and to banish all evil for peoples who seek coexistence and cooperation under the banner of human fraternity.@@@I am addressing the General Assembly today on behalf of the more than 14 million Palestinians whose parents and ancestors lived through the tragic Nakba 74 years ago and who are still experiencing its consequences, a source of shame for humankind and especially for all who conspired, planned and executed that heinous crime.@@@More than 5 million Palestinians have been living under Israel’s military occupation for 54 years.@@@I want to tell the Assembly today, on behalf of the Palestinians to whom I proudly belong, that unfortunately our trust in the possibility of achieving peace based on justice and international law is deteriorating because of Israel’s occupation policies.@@@Does the international community want to smother whatever hope we have left?@@@It is clear that Israel, which is ignoring all the resolutions of international legitimacy, has decided not to be our partner in the peace process.@@@It has undermined the Oslo Accords, which it signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).@@@Through its current policies, which are premeditated and deliberate, it has destroyed the possibility of a two-State solution, and that is unequivocal proof that Israel does not believe in
peace.@@@It believes in imposing the status quo by brute force and aggression.@@@We therefore do not have an Israeli partner with whom we can talk.@@@Israel is ending its contractual relation with us and is making the relationship between the State of Palestine and Israel into no more than one between an occupying State and an occupied people.@@@We will therefore deal with Israel as such henceforward, and we call on the international community to do the same.@@@It was not we who made that choice but rather Israel on its own.@@@Israel is launching a frantic campaign to confiscate our lands, build colonial settlements and loot our resources, as if the land was unpopulated and had no owners, just as in 1948.@@@It is giving free rein to the army and the terrorist settlers who are killing our Palestinian people in broad daylight, looting their land and taking their water, burning and demolishing their homes and forcing them to pay for the demolition or to destroy their homes with their own hands and uproot their own trees.@@@All of that is done with official protection.@@@Can anyone imagine such a thing?@@@Israel is telling the Palestinian people, “Either you demolish your house or I will demolish it myself.@@@But it is better if you demolish your house yourself with your own hands, because if I demolish it, you will have to pay for the demolition.”@@@Can anyone conceive of that?@@@I have to demolish my house or Israel will demolish it and make me pay for it.@@@The Israeli Government has authorized the establishment of racist Jewish terrorist organizations committing acts of terror against our people.@@@It has provided them with protection while they subject Palestinians to aggression and call for them to be expelled from their homes.@@@Foremost among those terrorist organizations are Hilltop Youth, Price Tag, Lehava, the Temple Guardians and many others.@@@Those terrorist organizations are led by members of the Israeli Knesset, the Israeli authority.@@@In that context, we call on the international community to put those organizations on the international terrorist lists.@@@That is the only place they deserve to be.@@@In its frantic settlement expansion, Israel has not left us any land on which we can establish our independent State.@@@Where can our people live in freedom and dignity?@@@Where can we build our independent State to live in peace with our neighbours?@@@We want to live in peace with them, with Israel.@@@Where will we establish our independent State to live in peace with them, with Israel?@@@Unfortunately there are now nearly 750,000 settlers, or 25 per cent of the total population, in the West Bank, the remaining Palestinian land after the partition resolution.@@@Israel is killing our people with impunity, as it did with the Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.@@@Everyone here has heard about Shireen Abu Akleh.@@@She was killed with a sniper’s bullets, which means that the sniper targeted her deliberately.@@@Israel has admitted that a sniper killed her.@@@In addition to being Palestinian, she also had American nationality.@@@I dare the United States to prosecute or make accountable those who killed her, because they are Israelis.@@@Israel also commits acts of aggression against our sacred holy sites, both Christian and Islamic, especially in Jerusalem, our eternal capital and crown jewel.@@@I would like to reiterate in that regard our acknowledgement of the Hashemite Custodianship of those holy sites.@@@Israel attacks Muslim and Christian holy sites on a daily basis and without any reason.@@@Israel attacked the funeral procession of Shireen Abu Akleh and her corpse inside the church, a holy place.@@@That is what Israel is doing to the holy sites.@@@Israel is imposing falsified curriculums in our schools in the occupied Jerusalem.@@@They are inventing curriculums.@@@They take books and change what is in them under the same authors and then they impose the curriculums on our children to control what they learn.@@@We will not allow that to happen.@@@That is a violation of international law.@@@Israel is disrupting the Palestinian presidential and legislative elections by forbidding Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem to take part in those elections.@@@Israel has done that three times before — in 1996, 2005 and 2006.@@@The Israeli authorities ask us, “Why do you not organize elections?”@@@We are ready.@@@We issued the decrees to organize those elections, and we decided to hold them, but Israel prevented us from holding them.@@@Therefore, we did not cancel the elections, we only postponed them.@@@When Israel allows the elections to take place, or when some party tells Israel that it can allow us to hold elections, or when orders reach Israel to allow elections to take place, we will then organize them.@@@Israel is enacting racist laws and consecrating the apartheid regime.@@@Yes, it is apartheid.@@@Even if Israel does not like that appellation, it is apartheid.@@@Israel is an apartheid regime.@@@This is not only between Palestinians and Jews.@@@Israel is taking actions against our people before the eyes of the international community with impunity.@@@Why is Israel not being held accountable
for violating international law?@@@Who is protecting Israel from being held accountable?@@@I have no idea.@@@Do Member States know who is protecting Israel from being held accountable?@@@It is the United Nations, and foremost of which the most powerful in the United Nations.@@@Why practise double standards when it comes to Israel?@@@Israel has repeatedly violated our land, and recently it closed the headquarters of six Palestinian human rights organizations.@@@Israel tries to implement the law, but if we make a mistake, it holds us accountable and says, “You have made a mistake.”@@@Israel determined, suddenly, that those organizations were terrorist organizations, and it raided their headquarters, looted their assets, confiscated their documents and burned them and did whatever it wanted.@@@The whole world says that was wrong, except for Israel.@@@Israel is saying that it was not wrong.@@@If that is what Israel did to the offices of human rights organizations, imagine what it would have done if they were not human rights organizations.@@@Since its creation, Israel has committed brutal crimes against our people.@@@It destroyed 529 Palestinian villages and expelled their residents during and after the war of 1948.@@@It displaced 950,000 Palestinian refugees, in other words, half of the Palestinian population at the time.@@@That is a figure that some try to manipulate.@@@It is not, as Israel says, 250,000 refugees.@@@No, the figure is indeed 950,000, according to the statistics of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, that is, the United Nations.@@@And of course, now the number of displaced is in the millions.@@@Since 1948, Israel has committed more than 50 massacres, including in Tantoura and Kafr Qasim.@@@Israel admitted that it had deliberately committed those massacres and targeted farmers returning from their farmland and killed them in cold blood.@@@There have been 50 or 51 massacres, the most recent of which was against Gaza, which was targeted with missiles.@@@I will not tell the Assembly how many elderly persons it killed, but The New York Times, a United States newspaper, said 67 children were killed in Gaza, as if they had been carrying rockets, using tanks and launching missiles.@@@Sixty-seven children were killed by Israel.@@@These are their photos.@@@Who is going to assume responsibility for that?@@@Why did Israel kill them?@@@I would like to provide the Assembly with the lists of the villages that were destroyed and the massacres that were perpetrated, and I would ask Israel, from this rostrum, to acknowledge its responsibility for destroying those villages, committing those massacres and displacing the Palestinian citizens and to apologize to the Palestinian people.@@@After all that killing, Israel must apologize.@@@We call on Israel to bear the legal, political, moral and material responsibilities.@@@It should be held accountable, and the international community must hold it accountable.@@@We ask the international community right now to hold Israel accountable for the massacres it has committed.@@@Yes, we will go to the International Criminal Court, and to all the courts of the world, but first and foremost to the International Criminal Court to ask Israel to assume its legal, political, moral and material responsibilities.@@@Do the Israeli people want to remain colonizers forever?@@@They have been colonizers for nearly 75 years.@@@How much longer do they want to remain so?@@@I ask the Assembly, should we wait for a century, or maybe for two centuries?@@@Why are we the only people on this planet still living under occupation?@@@I ask the General Assembly, the Security Council and advocates of human rights, why should we remain under occupation?@@@What are we still missing?@@@What are the Israelis going to teach us?@@@What are we missing that they need to occupy us, teach us, kill us, slaughter us or confiscate our land and loot our resources?@@@They even take the rain that falls on us, and then they sell it back to us.@@@They take our rain, and they sell it back to us.@@@We do not accept remaining the only party to respect the agreements we signed with Israel in 1993.@@@Those agreements are no longer valid on the ground because of Israel’s persistence on violating them.@@@Although we have asked Israel to end its occupation, its hostile measures and policies and unilateral actions, which were explicitly prohibited in the Oslo Accords and which President Biden mentioned to me personally — he said that unilateral actions should be ended — and while the Oslo Accords state that they should be ended, Israel has been the first to violate this prohibition, taking nothing but unilateral actions, while we have not taken any.@@@We do not want to do that, and we do not want to violate agreements.@@@Until when will we be the only ones committed to these agreements?@@@It is therefore our right — or, rather, our obligation — to look for other means to recover our rights and achieve a peace built on justice, including the implementation of the resolutions that were adopted
by our respective leaders, in particular our parliaments.@@@Seven years ago, our parliament adopted decisions, and we told its members to wait awhile, since maybe things will change; we told them to be patient, since maybe the United States or Israel will change its stance.@@@But no one listened to us.@@@We have made these decisions in order to preserve our national existence on our land and to uphold our historical rights as a nation under the umbrella of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.@@@The PLO brings together all Palestinian people, wherever they are in the world, be it inside Palestine, in the refugee camps or in the diaspora.@@@All those who have Palestinian nationality or used to have the Palestinian nationality fall under the umbrella of the PLO.@@@The United Nations, with its different bodies, has adopted hundreds of resolutions on Palestine.@@@None has been implemented.@@@How is that possible?@@@Not a single resolution has been implemented.@@@I am talking about 754 General Assembly resolutions, 97 Security Council resolutions and 96 Human Rights Council resolutions — and not a single one has been implemented.@@@How come?@@@Why is that?@@@Whenever a resolution is adopted, everyone calls for its implementation in line with international legitimacy, but no one cares about any of the resolutions adopted for Palestine.@@@Not a single resolution has been implemented.@@@We ask that one single resolution be implemented, so we can know that it has been implemented.@@@We now want the implementation of a single resolution, resolution 181 (II), which was adopted by the General Assembly, and which unjustly and aggressively partitioned Palestine.@@@Yes, we want that resolution to be implemented.@@@We want the General Assembly to implement resolution 181 (II), and with it, another resolution, namely, resolution 194 (III).@@@We want those two resolutions to be implemented because they are preconditions for Israel being accepted as a member of the United Nations.@@@When those resolutions were adopted, Moshe Sharett, the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, pledged to implement them, and as a result, Israel was accepted as member of the United Nations.@@@But until now neither resolution has been implemented.@@@I want resolution 181 (II) to be implemented — one single resolution.@@@It is our right to ask for its implementation.@@@I therefore ask that the General Assembly implement resolution 181 (II) and tell us that it has done so.@@@We have submitted a request to the Secretary- General to implement that resolution.@@@Is that possible or the Assembly will ignore us once again, as always?@@@The State of Palestine will also start the process of acceding to other international organizations.@@@We were allowed to join the United Nations as an observer State.@@@We are now an observer State at the United Nations.@@@There are 15 million Palestinians, all of them educated, some of them highly educated, but we are only observer member.@@@That membership status allows us to accede to other international organizations, and starting tomorrow we will pursue our right and accede to them.@@@It is our right to do so.@@@We will join the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.@@@We are going to accede to those organizations, which is our right to do, and no one should blame us.@@@The Security Council has adopted clear resolutions, whose implementation would achieve a just and comprehensive peace.@@@The most recent of those was resolution 2334 (2016), which the United States itself submitted for adoption.@@@The resolution was adopted, and two days after taking office Mr. Trump cancelled everything, including resolution 2334 (2016), and subsequently came up with his ultimate deal, which, together with all his other projects, we have totally rejected.@@@Resolution 2334 (2016) was submitted by the United States and adopted under its sponsorship.@@@But it went away because Mr. Trump rejected it.@@@I would like to remind the Assembly that we no longer need double standards.@@@If the State of Palestine is prohibited from obtaining full membership at the United Nations and if the Palestinian people are not protected from aggression — but no one has done anything — and if practical steps are not taken to end occupation and achieve peace, then we will have to resort once again to petitioning the General Assembly, asking for legal measures and political steps to be taken to achieve those goals.@@@Then we will have hope.@@@We have the right to hope.@@@We hope to be able to hope.@@@We are living on hope.@@@We are confident that the General Assembly will fully shoulder its responsibilities.@@@I am also confident that the Assembly will understand why we are going to take all those steps now.@@@Throughout the years we have tried everything to
convince Israel to return to the negotiating table based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the signed agreements, but Israel has refused and continues to refuse to do so.@@@With all due respect to what the international community has done — or has at least tried to do, because it has not done everything — in terms of support to our people and our just question politically and materially, it has unfortunately been unable to end the Israeli occupation and the heinous and continuous Israeli aggression against our people and provide them with protection.@@@We want to be protected.@@@We ask that we be protected.@@@Protect us.@@@We will not resort to weapons.@@@We will not resort to violence.@@@That I can promise.@@@We will not resort to terrorism.@@@Working hand in hand with members of the General Assembly, we will fight terrorism, but we want to be protected from violence, terrorism and arms just like other peoples of the world.@@@The occupying State is acting as if it were a State above the law.@@@Why is Israel acting as if it were a State above the law?@@@Can anyone answer me?@@@No one will answer me.@@@Surprisingly, States like the United States of America claim that they uphold international law and human rights, while at the same time — and I will speak frankly in this context — they provide unlimited support to Israel, and protect Israel from accountability.@@@Those States assist Israel in pursuing its hostile policies, in contempt of the international community as a whole.@@@Israel would not have been able to do what it is doing without the cover or the support of those States.@@@Honestly put, even if members do not say that out of courtesy, I will say it.@@@Some of those States were partners at the very beginning, when they adopted decisions that led to the Nakba of the Palestinian people, in particular the ominous Balfour Declaration.@@@Do members of the Assembly remember the Balfour Declaration?@@@Of course they do not, because we are the only ones who are suffering its consequences.@@@And then came the mandate and the sustained injustice against the Palestinian people when those States refused to compel Israel to end its occupation and aggression and respect the resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@Those States therefore bear, along with Israel, the responsibility for the plight of the Palestinian people.@@@We therefore request Britain, the United States and Israel — and this is an official request — to acknowledge their responsibility for the major crime that was committed against our people and apologize for it.@@@We ask for remedy and redress and for compensation to be granted to the Palestinian people — compensation that would be decided under international law.@@@We will accept whatever is decided.@@@We just want the injustice to be acknowledged.@@@Sadly enough, the United States and several European States that are enthusiastic about the two-@@@State solution have recognized the State of Israel but have not so far recognized the State of Palestine.@@@Our State exists and should be recognized in order to achieve peace.@@@Those States have not so far recognized the State of Palestine, and they threaten to use the veto right if we try to ask for a full membership at the United Nations.@@@If we ask — or when we ask — for full membership, they threaten us with the use of the veto right.@@@To whom can we complain?@@@We can only complain to God.@@@For 10 years now, the Observer State of Palestine at the United Nations has proved that Palestine qualifies for full membership.@@@We have all recognized this.@@@Palestine has been working seriously and responsibly with other States of the world in different committees and specialized organs.@@@It has successfully and with great efficiency chaired the Group of 77 and China.@@@We are an observer State, and yet we have chaired that Group and succeeded in our work, and the Assembly has recognized that.@@@So why we are not allowed to be a full member?@@@What are we lacking?@@@Why is it that those States cannot recognize the State of Palestine and accept its full-fledged membership in the United Nations?@@@We therefore wish, beg and plead as we reiterate our request to attain full membership now.@@@We also ask why double standards are imposed upon us?@@@We are the exception.@@@We are the only ones in the world on whom double standards are being imposed.@@@On the other hand, we call upon the Secretary- General of the United Nations to work tirelessly to come up with an international plan to end the occupation of the land of the State of Palestine, to achieve peace, security and stability in the region, in line with the resolutions of the international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@The Arab Peace Initiative has been violated by some, but it still exists, and resolution 1515 (2003) still needs to be implemented.@@@When we hear something positive, we acknowledge it.@@@Yesterday and the day before, I listened to President of the United States Joe Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid (see A/77/PV. 6 and A/77/PV.8, respectively), and to other world leaders.@@@I heard them supporting the two-State solution, and I was pleased to hear that.@@@Undoubtedly, this is a positive development.@@@The real test for the seriousness and credibility of this stance — because we have had enough of resolutions and words — is for the Israeli Government to return to the negotiating table immediately, tomorrow, to implement the two-State solution in line with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, and to end all the unilateral measures that undermine the two-State solution.@@@Israel cannot negotiate while building settlements, killing and injuring people, and demolishing houses.@@@On the contrary, those acts must cease even temporarily to let us negotiate.@@@If the negotiations fail, then Israel can do whatever it wants.@@@But if it wants to negotiate, it has to stop these unilateral measures.@@@In reality, the State of Palestine is looking forward to peace.@@@Let us make peace so that we can live in security, stability and prosperity for the benefit of future generations of all the peoples of the region.@@@We want peace.@@@We are fighting terrorism wherever it is found.@@@The Assembly knows that we have signed agreements to fight global terrorism with 85 States around the world, at the forefront of which is the United States.@@@No one can deny it.@@@What more is required from us?@@@We are ready for that.@@@I want to tell my people and the whole world that I am proud to have spent many decades of my life struggling with my brethren, the leaders of the Palestinian people, some who have passed away and some who are still alive, to preserve the rights of our heroes and courageous people, which have been the best example of sacrifice.@@@Despite all the conspiracies and pressures that were placed on our people, we have maintained our independent national decision, which is a decision with which no one can interfere.@@@The decisions we take are our own, and no one can interfere in them.@@@We are also attached to our national constants, which are well known, and we reiterate our rejection of any order or directive from whomever in the world.@@@We are not ready to accept directives from any State, whether large or small.@@@We make our own decisions.@@@I would like to pay tribute to the Palestinian martyrs who have lit the way to freedom and independence with their blood.@@@They will remain symbols to be remembered by generations of Palestinians one after the other with gratitude and reverence, and we will live up to the responsibility they left us.@@@As for our brave prisoners, they are the living conscience of our people.@@@They are sacrificing their freedom for the freedom of their people.@@@Words cannot describe them.@@@They are living martyrs.@@@Some have received four or five life sentences, keeping them endlessly in prisons.@@@They are heroes and deep-rooted leaders.@@@We will always work for their freedom.@@@We will not fail them until they are freed.@@@We will not fail their sons and their daughters.@@@We will not fail their families and their relatives.@@@Some of our prisoners are children — of 10 years of age, 8 years of age, 7 years of age, 6 years of age — yet they are prisoners.@@@We have one child who was arrested by 30 soldiers.@@@Is it acceptable?@@@Tens of thousands of our children are in prison.@@@Who can accept that?@@@Which international law — which good conscience — can accept that a seven-year-old child is prosecuted and imprisoned?@@@Legally and practically speaking, children are not responsible for all their acts.@@@I would like to talk about the hero and prisoner Nasser Abu Hamid whose transformation since he was sentenced is shocking.@@@Look at how he was before and how he is now.@@@Now, he is just waiting for his death to come at any time.@@@His mother is asking to see him for just one minute.@@@Why are they not allowing his mother to see him for a single minute?@@@She is the mother of martyrs and prisoners.@@@The mother of Nasser Abu Hamid has numerous children, and among them are martyrs and prisoners.@@@She wants to see her son, but she is forbidden to see him.@@@No religion, no law can find this acceptable.@@@From this rostrum, I would like to pay tribute to the mother of Nasser, a mother of prisoners and martyrs.@@@Unfortunately, the occupying Power has not allowed her to see her son, the prisoner and hero, for a single minute while he is fighting death because of medical negligence.@@@He is a prisoner with cancer.@@@He committed a crime but, from a humanitarian point of view, he should be receive treatment but he is not allowed to.@@@He is not allowed to see his mother, and no one will be allowed to see him, even after he passes away.@@@We have hundreds of graves with numbers.@@@They put deceased martyrs in a digital prison to punish his mother — and
us.@@@Since 1967, martyrs are held in digital prisons and mortuaries.@@@Is this acceptable?@@@Who can accept that?@@@In conclusion, I would like to say to the General Assembly, which represents the international community and embodies international legitimacy, that the occupation will definitely end, sooner or later.@@@Let the Assembly now bear the responsibility for implementing its resolutions.@@@Let us achieve a just and comprehensive peace instead of achieving a peace with further sacrifices.@@@We have been waiting for too long.@@@We are very tired.@@@We have had to live through long bitter days.@@@Does the General Assembly have a solution?@@@I want a solution.@@@We stand at a historic watershed moment.@@@Seventy-seven years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations, yet we are still witnessing devastation in Ukraine and around the world.@@@What would the founders of the United Nations, who were determined not to repeat the scourge of the world wars, think if they saw the challenges to the international order that we are facing?@@@We have all gathered here at the General Assembly because we stand with the fundamental vision and principles of the Charter of the United Nations — to realize an international community in which Member States unite to maintain peace and security and all people can enjoy economic and social development.@@@Is that not what we are aiming for?@@@It is imperative to maintain an international order in which the rule of law is firmly established.@@@The United Nations has played a central role in the development of such an international order.@@@However, today we see its foundations being gravely shaken.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an act that tramples on the vision and principles of the Charter.@@@It is crucial for all countries to be under the rule of law, not the rule of force.@@@We absolutely cannot allow that.@@@The United Nations does not exist solely for the benefit of the great Powers.@@@It exists for the entire international community, founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member States.@@@It exists to fulfil the claims of not just the powerful and loud States but also of the voices that often go unheard but are equally legitimate.@@@And it is especially relevant at a time when the existing international order is being
tested around the world.@@@Now is the time to return to the vision and principles of the Charter and to mobilize our strength and wisdom in order to ensure an international order that is based on the rule of law.@@@To that end, we must reform the United Nations and strengthen its functions.@@@The late Secretary-General Hammarskjold, who was killed in the line of duty while attempting to mediate a ceasefire during the Congo crisis, said that “[i]t is our responsibility to remedy any flaws there may be” in the institutions of the United Nations.”@@@In order to realize the world to which the Charter aspires, we must tackle head-on the strengthening of the functions of our Organization.@@@In order to demonstrate Japan’s strong commitment to the United Nations and to multilateralism, I would hereby like to outline Japan’s commitment to realizing our Organization’s vision.@@@First, we must reform the United Nations, including the Security Council, in order to return to the vision and principles of the United Nations Charter, with the strengthening of the Organization’s functions, including with regard to disarmament and non-proliferation.@@@Secondly, we must bring about a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community.@@@Thirdly, we must promote efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era.@@@We must face the fact that the credibility of the United Nations is at stake due to the aggression against Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@We, the States Members of the United Nations, must act to restore this Organization’s credibility.@@@There are frequent discussions about the dysfunctionality of the Security Council.@@@We have debated that issue for 30 years.@@@But what is truly needed now is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but actions towards reform.@@@Even among the permanent member States of the Security Council, there are some countries that have shown a willingness to embrace reform.@@@But there can be no reform without negotiation.@@@The various positions cannot be compromised or converge without any negotiation.@@@The time has come to start text-based negotiations in order to reform the Security Council.@@@The Summit of the Future, in 2024, is an excellent opportunity to broadly review the nature of the United Nations.@@@By all means, let us gather a wide range of wisdom, including from experts, and build momentum.@@@Faced with the crisis of the international order caused by Russia’s aggression, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms with an overwhelming majority (resolution ES- 11/1).@@@At that time, the United Nations was a beacon in the dark night, clearly indicating the direction in which the international community should go.@@@The General Assembly proved to be the sole universal organ that represents all Member States, pointing us in the direction of the international community’s just cause.@@@Japan is determined not only to reform the Security Council, but also to work earnestly to further revitalize the General Assembly and to push the United Nations so it can pursue an even greater role in the maintenance of peace and security.@@@Japan will also continue to support the Secretary-General as he oversees the activities of this Organization.@@@Even threatening to use nuclear weapons, as Russia has done, not to mention actually using them, is a serious threat to the peace and security of the international community and is absolutely unacceptable.@@@As a Prime Minister from Hiroshima, I am immensely dedicated to the realization of a world without nuclear weapons, driven by the sentiments from the hibakusha, the victims of the use of nuclear weapons.@@@Last month, the sole opposition by Russia blocked the unity and concerted efforts of the international community to reach consensus on an outcome document that would maintain and strengthen the non-proliferation regime, which is the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.@@@That caused me great dismay, just as it did for the overwhelming majority of the Member States.@@@However, I refuse to relent, because we are only one country away from adopting the draft final outcome document by consensus.@@@I believe that document represents a new foundation for the international community to proceed with realistic engagements on nuclear disarmament in future.@@@As the only nation to have ever suffered atomic bombings during war, Japan has a unique historical role, and we renew our resolve to realize a world without nuclear weapons.@@@We will continue to make pragmatic efforts to achieve that goal.@@@We must ensure that Nagasaki remains the last place to suffer an atomic bombing.@@@This is the twentieth year since the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, signed by Prime Minister Koizumi and Chairman of the National
Defence Commission Kim Jong II.@@@Japan’s policy remains unchanged.@@@Japan seeks to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration, through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern, such as the abductions and the nuclear and missile issues, as well as putting the unfortunate past behind us.@@@Japan is prepared to engage in dialogue on matters of mutual concern.@@@I am determined to meet with President Kim Jong Un, without any conditions, and will seize any opportunity and give my all to take diligent action in that regard.@@@Japan has also made long-term contributions in the field of peacebuilding.@@@Japan first participated in a full-scale peacekeeping mission in Cambodia in 1992.@@@Thirty years later, many Cambodian personnel wearing blue helmets are protecting the peace and future of places such as Mali, the Central African Republic and Lebanon.@@@Then Lieutenant Colonel Teav Chanrithy was one of many deployed to Lebanon after Japan’s peacekeeping training.@@@Since then, he has been active as a peacebuilder, mentoring younger generations at the peacekeeping operations training centre for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.@@@The torch of peace created through Japan’s contributions to peacekeeping operations will be borne beyond generations and across borders.@@@Japan supports it.@@@Japan is fully committed to the realization of a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community.@@@The rule of law is not reserved for one particular State or region.@@@We need to remind ourselves that the rule of law is especially important for vulnerable nations.@@@Strengthening the rule of law based on international law will, in the long run, benefit all States and lead to the sustainable growth and sound development of the international community.@@@On the basis of that conviction, Japan has been playing an active role in various fields in cooperation with other countries, including efforts towards the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific.@@@In 1970, overcoming serious divisions among Member States at the time and with persistent dialogue, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV), entitled “The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States”, also known as the friendly relations declaration.@@@That Declaration, the fruit of our predecessors’ wisdom, serves as a foundation from which the basic principles for the promotion of the rule of law are drawn.@@@The following basic principles for States emerge from that Declaration: first, to break away from rule by force and pursue the rule of law through observing international law in good faith; secondly, to not allow any attempts to change the status quo of territories or areas by force or coercion; and thirdly, to cooperate with one another in addressing serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter.@@@We are convinced that those basic principles serve as the basis to hold an increasingly divided international community together while ensuring respect for human rights and achieving sustainable development.@@@Starting in January, Japan will serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.@@@By listening not only to the big voices but also the small voices, we intend to take action to strengthen the rule of law in the international community.@@@Japan will strengthen efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era.@@@People deserve to enjoy a high-quality life, free from anxiety and fear.@@@The concept of human security has not changed, but now we are standing at a historical watershed moment and facing a new challenge.@@@Today, in addition to global pandemics, we see the use of force and coercion against other countries, food and energy insecurity, inflation and climate change.@@@These are all interconnected and threaten the safety of people now more than ever, further exacerbating poverty and disease.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals aim for a society in which no one is left behind, and their achievement requires the realization of human security in the new area.@@@In doing so, the key is to enhance the resilience of individuals, societies and nations to cope with the changes and challenges specific to our times.@@@Adjumani district, in Uganda, is facing difficult and complicated issues, such as the increasing influx of refugees from neighbouring countries and rising costs due to the situation in Ukraine, which is just one example of the difficult and complex challenges that the world is facing today.@@@Moini Fred, an administrator from Adjumani, learned through the Japan International Cooperation Agency training how to incorporate the views of both
refugees and his compatriots in running his district.@@@Despite its own economic difficulties, Adjumani district continues to provide administrative services as well as support to refugees, and Mr. Fred is working hard to build a cohesive community free of ethnicity- or nationality-based tensions.@@@With an unsteady international order and amid growing anxiety, Japan will work with the United Nations in order to realize human security in the new era, including on initiatives through the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security.@@@In addition, Japan will also continue to invest generously in people.@@@At the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in August, I announced the investment of $30 billion in Africa as the sum of public and private financial contributions over the next three years, with an emphasis on investment in people.@@@Japan will also focus on human-resource development and capacity-building in other parts of the world.@@@Based on my conviction that education is the foundation of peace, I will serve as an education champion and promote cooperation through human- resource development based on the outcome of the United Nations Transforming Education Summit.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has also illustrated the importance of human health and efforts to protect people from disease.@@@Japan has provided a total of approximately $5 billion to support the COVID-19 response, including vaccine-related assistance through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility and other programmes.@@@Japan has also decided to contribute $1.08 billion to the Global Fund over the next three years.@@@Japan will continue to take a leading role in strengthening the global health architecture and achieving universal health coverage in the post-COVID-19 era as we approach next year’s@@@Group of Seven summit, which I will preside over.@@@Japan is also contributing steadily to the creation of a world where people can enjoy a high-quality life in a safe environment.@@@Our emergency assistance and support to strengthen the resilience of food systems in order to ensure food security, as well as our role in the development of international standards and norms in the field of information and telecommunications through the efforts at the International Telecommunication Union and other organizations, are just a few examples.@@@In order to promote those efforts, Japan will also revise its Development Cooperation Charter, which articulates the basic policy of our development-cooperation policies.@@@I support the Secretary-General’s leadership in presenting Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a response to the current and future challenges facing the international community.@@@As history experiences this dramatic change, Japan will continue to support suffering people around the world under the concept of human security in the new era.@@@Japan will work together with the United Nations and Member States towards the maintenance of peace and stability underpinned by an international order based on the rule of law.@@@It is precisely because we stand at a watershed moment in history that Japan continues to have strong expectations for the United Nations.@@@Times change, but one thing remains the same: the vision and the principles of the United Nations.@@@With that conviction, I am determined to work with everyone in order to strengthen the United Nations.@@@First of all, I would like to endorse what my colleague Mr. Charles Michel just said on behalf of the European Union, since I come from a generation that has never seen war.@@@We thought that war belonged only in history books.@@@However, our continent is now experiencing war on its soil.@@@I think that our strength is precisely our solidarity, our unison and, above all, our unity.@@@I am proud that, with its partners, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is contributing to the European Union’s determined action to promote common values — human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.@@@As Europeans, we are wholeheartedly committed to defending such values, which are the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and to strengthening multilateralism — doing things together, with the United Nations at its heart.@@@For his presidency, the President has framed the general debate under the theme “A watershed moment”, and he stressed the need to find “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@I want to say that we are currently at a watershed moment for the entire world and for the United Nations.@@@For almost seven months, the Russian Federation, which, I do not need to recall, is a permanent member of the Security Council, has been waging a full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine, a sovereign neighbour, with the involvement of Belarus.@@@For many people, and perhaps in many other countries, on the European continent anyway, that unprovoked and unjustified war has revived the fear of a war.@@@As I said a moment ago, now more than ever, it is again becoming a matter of wondering if it is possible.@@@The recent threats and measures announced by Moscow only exacerbate the situation.@@@I want to say that we strongly condemn them.@@@We face a situation with the Russian veto and the Security Council deadlocked.@@@That is difficult.@@@The Secretary-General condemned Russia’s clear violation of the United Nations Charter.@@@I do not need to remind Member States that, on 16 March, the International Court of Justice indicated provisional measures requiring the Russian Federation to immediately suspend the military operations.@@@This Assembly also met in an emergency special session and adopted three resolutions in that context (resolutions ES-11/1, ES-11/2 and ES-11/3).@@@We also see that a large majority of the members of this Assembly condemned Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and demanded a ceasefire.@@@At the request of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, I, as Prime Minister, also wanted to do something.@@@I held talks with the Russian President.@@@As there are representatives of the Russian Federation in this Hall, I must say that I do not regret having tried.@@@I am disappointed with the outcome when, for example, I heard President Erdogan say last week that there would perhaps be peace, and, the same day, President Putin announced the organization of referendums.@@@When we ourselves organize a referendum, we know how long it takes.@@@Organizing a referendum in time of war and, if I understood correctly, going knocking on doors and asking people to vote at the ballot box, I do not know how that would be arranged.@@@One cannot organize a referendum in the current circumstances.@@@The population is being driven abroad.@@@I even fear that the referendums will be an excuse to justify further actions, to say that it is a Russian territory, and that Donbas must therefore be protected by Russia, and to support the use of even more brutal means than those already being used.@@@I regret that.@@@I appreciated the discussions that I had with President Putin — the exchanges and the frankness.@@@But I must say that today I note that it is easy to begin a war, but the greatness of a political figure is rather to know when to end it and to want to get out of it.@@@I do not know how President Putin is now going to explain.@@@In recent days, there has also been the mobilization, where young people are requested to join the Russian troops.@@@How is he going to explain to mothers that they are going to lose their sons, to wives that they will lose their husbands and to children that they will lose their fathers to a meaningless war?@@@I have now been Prime Minister of my country for nine years and, as a politician, I have always tried to find answers to the questions that I ask myself.@@@I say to the Russian representatives that this is the first time that I was not able to find answers.@@@I cannot understand.@@@I therefore once again appeal to their President that there be a ceasefire and diplomacy.@@@I made those calls but, after Bucha, I could not go on.@@@I say it frankly.@@@I could not understand.@@@In particular, finding out that soldiers who had committed crimes were being decorated is intolerable to me — and that word is not strong enough.@@@It is unacceptable to me.@@@The war continues.@@@It has already claimed more than 14,000 victims among the civilian population in Ukraine, including more than 1,000 children.@@@When we see the mass graves that are being found, with people who have been beaten up, which is what I also saw in Bucha — summary executions — every day that it continues is one day too many.@@@I would also like to say that the Russian aggression also poses threats to Ukrainian nuclear facilities.@@@In many countries, people are frightened.@@@It is an unacceptable risk for Ukraine, but also the other European countries.@@@As I said, about three months ago, I travelled to Ukraine.@@@I visited the towns of Borodyanka, Bucha and Irpin, where I met — forgive me, but I am talking about a personal experience — a woman who had lost everything, but she remained hopeful and retained the will to believe in peace.@@@She was there with her grandson, who had become deaf from the bombings next to him.@@@I say to the Russian representatives that one cannot condemn a country and a generation.@@@One cannot kill innocent people.@@@I cannot find the words.@@@When I saw the impact of the atrocities committed by the Russian military forces, I could only bow to the memory of the children — the innocent — who pay with their lives, shattered by the war.@@@I say it here, and I also said it in Kyiv: Ukraine can continue to count on us to help it to defend its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and the right to legitimate defence, as enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter.@@@It is our responsibility to help Ukraine.@@@We cannot accept a larger neighbour.@@@Those here can see that I am not from one of the larger countries in terms of its size or its army, but I cannot imagine living in a country where I would have to worry about the extent of action of my neighbours.@@@I think that the greatest project that my continent has seen is the European Union.@@@If I have lived in peace since 1957, it is precisely because we try to build things together.@@@It is true that my country is between France and Germany, which were enemies at the time of the Second World War.@@@Today we are partners, and we are building something together.@@@I would not be here today, and I would not be living in a democracy, if countries that were not my neighbours, but other countries, had not helped us.@@@In Luxembourg, we too opened our doors to people fleeing war.@@@Those people are not seeking a better life; they simply want to live.@@@We welcomed more than 1,000 students from Ukraine to our schools.@@@Whether it is in Kyiv or in our country, there is the courage of those students, families, children and men in Ukraine who have also begun to rebuild their country and revive their cities, liberated after the barbarity that took place there.@@@We must constantly honour that courage and support the investigations carried out by national and international actors — I am thinking in particular of the International Criminal Court — so that those responsible for war crimes and other crimes committed in Ukraine are identified, prosecuted and punished.@@@There can be no impunity, not for war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide or the crime of aggression.@@@Let me take this opportunity to also commend the courage in Russia, because President Putin has now called for a mobilization, and we see young Russians leaving their country.@@@As Mr. Michel said earlier, we cannot talk about war by just condemning it.@@@It is already too late, for what has taken place is inexcusable.@@@A ceasefire and an end to the killing of innocent people are things that are close to my heart.@@@I will say why I am so sensitive to this subject.@@@I had a grandmother who was Russian and a grandfather who was Polish.@@@I have a grandfather from Luxembourg and a French grandmother.@@@My grandmother was Orthodox, my grandfather Jewish, the other grandfather an atheist and the other grandmother a Catholic.@@@Even in my country, having Jewish blood, being liberal and one’s husband being a man, I would have been condemned to death in my own country.@@@Let us accept differences.@@@Let us accept the wealth of diversity.@@@If we are to live in peace, let us not make the same mistakes.@@@I appeal to President Putin.@@@I said earlier that starting a war was not the most difficult, but knowing how to get out of it is where one recognizes greatness, particularly as this war started at a time when most of us sighed with relief that we were leaving the coronavirus disease behind.@@@We thought that we were going to be able to leave it behind.@@@Now there is food insecurity, particularly in countries with vulnerable populations in Africa and the Middle East.@@@I reiterate to African colleagues, for I know that the narrative that it is European sanctions that create problems for the food crisis is false.@@@It is the war, the aggression in Ukraine that is responsible for the problems that they are experiencing.@@@I must also thank President Erdogan, who sat at the table to try and find a way out of the Black Sea for Ukrainian grain exports.@@@It is a crucial agreement for millions of people.@@@We are also seeing a rise in energy prices and very harsh consequences for many Europeans as well.@@@It is easy to say that we should abandon the sanctions.@@@What I would like is that we give up the war — not us, but them, our Russian colleagues.@@@I would also like to welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to identify short-, medium- and long-term solutions.@@@I thank Antonio Guterres and his teams for their tremendous efforts, as I said earlier, regarding the agreement with Tiirkiye.@@@We must also express our support for the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development in strengthening food resilience.@@@Today we see that the Sahel region is suffering from food insecurity, amplified by climate change and the effects of the war.@@@Not long ago — and I would like to thank the leadership of President Bazoum — I was in the Niger, a partner country of Luxembourg’s cooperation.@@@We want to work towards more stability in the region.@@@I also remember when I met Mr. Roch Kabore and Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.@@@The leaders have now changed.@@@I think that stability in Africa is a tragic element, together with other existing crises.@@@I am proud to be Prime Minister of a country where 1 per cent of its gross national income is allocated to official development assistance (ODA).@@@As most Member States can imagine, every time we talk about official development assistance, there is someone who will say: why are they helping others; there are still problems at home?@@@But I am proud of the 1 per cent assistance.@@@When we see some problems that we have at home, they are tiny compared to others.@@@We also want to contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the partnership with Africa is crucial.@@@We intend to strengthen it at the continental level, between the European Union and the African Union, and at the bilateral level.@@@That partnership goes beyond traditional cooperation, focusing on social sectors, such as health care and education.@@@It extends to cooperation on renewable energy and the fight against climate change, as we are also doing with our partners in Cabo Verde.@@@It also extends to cooperation in technology and information and communications.@@@I was recently in Kigali, in Rwanda, where we continue such collaboration.@@@If we want to be credible partners, we must particularly not just hold donor meetings, because they tend to do only that, but also deliver on our commitments.@@@It is pointless to meet to make promises, but then not keep them.@@@For my part, for example in terms of climate financing, my country decided to apply the principle of additionality.@@@Our financing is therefore in addition to our ODA.@@@At the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Glasgow, I announced that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was going to increase its climate financing to €220 million for the period from 2021 to 2025.@@@Half of that funding will go to adaptation to climate change in the most vulnerable countries.@@@We also intend to invest an increasing share in innovative instruments to mobilize private financing.@@@We are a European leader in sustainable financing.@@@We play a major role in mobilizing the private capital needed to finance the transition to carbon neutrality, including with the European Investment Bank in the area of sustainable financing.@@@Given the climate emergency, I must say that, as politicians, we are at times a little timid.@@@We ask ourselves if we should or should not act.@@@We wonder what the consequences will be if the temperature increases by 1°C or 2°C.@@@But some countries wonder how long they will even exist.@@@They risk being erased from the map of the world because of the temperature rise.@@@Are we as aware of that?@@@In Luxembourg, I launched the Citizens’ Climate Council, where we asked 100 people to meet and make proposals.@@@We realize that our citizens’ proposals are often bolder than how we, as politicians, think.@@@It is quite an interesting experience, and we need to listen to them.@@@Many of us will meet in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@We must mobilize to stay on course for the 1.5°C target that we signed up to in Paris.@@@Only by making joint efforts can we manage to mitigate the impact of climate change.@@@Allow me to also think about our friends in Pakistan and what is happening there.@@@Climate change also has an impact on human rights, in particular the rights of children.@@@That is among Luxembourg’s priorities at the Human Rights Council, where we are also committed to promoting gender equality, fighting against discrimination, strengthening the rule of law and civic space and combating impunity.@@@Allow me to have a thought for Mahsa Amini in Iran and what happened with the morality police, who decided a woman’s fate.@@@As I said before the Assembly last year (see A/76/PV.13), is it normal that, depending on my place of birth, my rights differ, and that, depending on my place of birth, if I am a member of a certain religion, I do not have rights?@@@Is it normal that, if I have a different political view, I do not have rights and, if I am of a different sexual orientation, I do not have rights?@@@In some countries, I would even be condemned to death.@@@And if I am a woman, I have less rights than a man.@@@That is a reality today in 2022.@@@It is therefore very important that we continue to have the independent international commission to investigate violations of human rights.@@@Unfortunately, that has an increasingly heavy workload at the international level.@@@We are committed to living up to the responsibility of Luxembourg having been elected to the Human Rights Council for the 2022-2024 term.@@@This is the first time that we have had the honour of a seat on the Council.@@@I would like to take this opportunity today to thank Member States very warmly, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government and country, for having placed their trust in us.@@@The President emphasized the fact that we are at a decisive turning point and that we all should meet the various challenges facing us, be it war or climate change.@@@We must find common responses.@@@We must also act together.@@@To those who say that the United Nations is powerless, I say that the United Nations is what we make it.@@@It all depends on our ambition and what we manage to do with that.@@@It is up to us to mobilize to find solutions and forge partnerships and compromises that allow us to strengthen multilateral cooperation.@@@This spring, for example, Luxembourg had the honour of facilitating, together with Bangladesh, the negotiations that led to the adoption by consensus of the first declaration on the progress made in the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 76/266).@@@We were also involved in the efforts that led to the adoption by consensus of the Liechtenstein veto initiative (resolution 76/262).@@@It establishes a permanent mandate for this Assembly to debate the use of the veto in the Security Council.@@@We have a system.@@@It is what it is.@@@Let us make the best of it.@@@We also need Security Council reform.@@@The United Nations cannot be a dog that barks but does not bite — a dog without teeth.@@@It is important that we achieve a United Nations that works.@@@We manage to explain what this body is.@@@Let us recall why we are here.@@@It was after the Second World War that we wanted to sit around a table to find solutions and work together.@@@Today the United Nations should not be a place where, by means of a veto, I can obstruct the will to build something together.@@@We therefore welcome the work that has been launched to follow up on the proposals made by the
Secretary-General.@@@A few days ago, the Transforming Education Summit was held.@@@The decision was taken to establish the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth.@@@The involvement of young people is crucial because they will be paying for the mistakes that we are making today.@@@We must have the courage to recognize that politics, of course, involves achieving short-term objectives but most importantly, it is about the legacy we leave to future generations.@@@I therefore want to assure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue to place itself at the service of the United Nations in order to champion our common values — the values of humanity.@@@That is why the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is also submitting its candidature for a seat on the Security Council for the 2031 to 2032 term.@@@It is why we continue to be committed to peace and security in Ukraine, Mali and the Middle East.@@@It is why we are committed to rights for all human beings and supporting humanitarian action for the people of the Sahel and Syria.@@@And it is why we will always be at the ready to defend the Charter of the United Nations.@@@I hope that by the time we meet here next year the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine will have been relegated to history.@@@We live in difficult times.@@@Our predecessors, who adopted the Charter of the United Nations, were “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.@@@Almost eight decades later, peace is still under threat, this time from worrying new challenges — the most severe since the end of the Second World War.@@@Since 24 February we have been witnessing the tragic consequences of the unprovoked and illegal war started by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, against Ukraine.@@@We have also witnessed exceptional solidarity from numerous countries united in their support for Ukraine, a sovereign member of the General Assembly and a victim of months of aggression against its civilians, basic infrastructure and economy.@@@The consequences of the war are global and are not limited to our security.@@@They refer to blatant violations of norms and principles of international law, including international humanitarian law, fundamental human rights and sustainable development worldwide.@@@Those should be of major concern for all of us, irrespective of how far we are from the conflict.@@@There is no justification for a military aggression against a sovereign State.@@@There is no justification for bloodshed, destruction or human suffering.@@@It is our joint responsibility to come together and uphold our common values as Members of the United Nations.@@@Democracy and universal human rights are legitimate aspirations for all humankind.@@@We therefore need to act now and support all who fight for freedom and democracy.@@@We should guarantee respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of all States.@@@Romania supported and will continue to support Ukraine, as its people are also fighting for our values and democracy.@@@Romania has opened its frontiers and its heart to all those seeking refuge from the war in Ukraine.@@@Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 2.3 million Ukrainians have crossed our borders.@@@Romania has offered not only emergency assistance, but also medium- and long-term support for those who have decided to stay in our country, with free access to education, health services and the labour market.@@@In addition, we have offered direct humanitarian assistance and put in place a logistics hub for coordinating international humanitarian assistance from the entire world.@@@Our support will not stop there.@@@We know that our response, especially to this war, will shape our common future.@@@Our support for peace should be voiced now louder than ever.@@@In defending our universal values, it is essential to stay united and bring everyone on board, including those who are still hesitating.@@@Engagement and dialogue are crucial to overcoming divisions and, at the same time, to countering the spread of falsehoods and propaganda.@@@The challenges we face today —such as the impact of climate change and the loss of biodiversity, energy insecurity, the lack of access to food and education, and social inequities — are becoming more and more severe.@@@They need responses and solutions, as our citizens are rightfully asking for them.@@@For all those issues, common action is the only way forward.@@@Energy security is a global concern, requiring joint solutions and responsible action.@@@We must avoid the use of energy as a tool of blackmail.@@@Energy security requires strategic investments in renewables, in nuclear power — with new future-oriented projects, such as small modular reactors — or in hydrogen.@@@It also requires energy prices that are accessible to our citizens.@@@Ensuring energy security goes hand in hand with the green transition for resilient and climate-neutral economies.@@@The nexus between climate change and peace and security should be more prominent in our discussions, including in the Security Council.@@@Despite our efforts, we have not moved past the triple crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.@@@All our efforts in the European Union and in coordination with international partners are meant to identify and implement the best solutions to those serious difficulties.@@@In two months’ time, we shall meet in Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and additional commitments towards climate neutrality are necessary, along with the implementation of the decisions already made.@@@The clock is ticking, and the planet cannot wait any longer.@@@Raising awareness, educating future generations on environmental protection and fighting climate change is of utmost importance and a topic very close to my heart.@@@Education is a top priority for Romania and a strategic investment in our future.@@@Therefore, we also look forward to the Summit of the Future, to be held in 2024.@@@Weaponizing access to food and restricting it around the world is unacceptable.@@@In order to support the Ukrainian economy and help manage the global food crisis, Romania has acted in a responsible way by facilitating the export of more than 4 million tons of Ukrainian grain, which represents 60 per cent of the grain exported by Ukraine, through our ports on the Danube and the Black Sea since the beginning of the crisis.@@@We also commend the role of the Secretary-General in reaching the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is, as he symbolically put it, a beacon of hope in a world that truly needs it.@@@Romania has long argued for keeping the so-called protracted or frozen conflicts high on our agenda and for focusing on how to solve them.@@@The war against Ukraine has taught us that, in such contexts, the absence of war does not mean peace.@@@Protracted conflicts, such as those in the Black Sea region, need to be addressed without delay.@@@United Nations peacekeeping has always been an instrument of paramount importance in safeguarding peace and security.@@@Romania’s solid contribution to various operations around the globe stands as proof of our commitment.@@@We need to ensure that, in line with the Action for Peacekeeping agenda, United Nations peacekeeping missions become more effective and contribute to political solutions to conflicts, placing human rights at the core of their action.@@@We also need steadfast action by the international community to protect and promote human rights.@@@We must strengthen the United Nations human rights system and ensure the sustainable and adequate funding of all its activities.@@@We recognize the essential role played by civil society actors and human rights defenders in the promotion and protection of human rights.@@@Ensuring the proper functioning of democratic institutions, upholding respect for the rule of law and guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms remains fundamental.@@@It is with these firm convictions that Romania has presented its candidacy for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025.@@@I would like to conclude by stressing that we need to restore public trust in effective multilateralism.@@@Only together will we be able to identify and implement sustainable solutions in order to achieve world peace, prosperity, the fulfillment of human rights and a healthy environment for future generations.@@@Costa Rica congratulates the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on his election.@@@We are confident that his extensive political experience will be crucial to the success of the work ahead.@@@A maelstrom of challenges is shaking the foundations of our Organization.@@@The pandemic has been raging for three years now, and 30.3 per cent of humankind have yet to receive a single vaccine.@@@The climate crisis and biodiversity loss are hitting us mercilessly and without discrimination.@@@We are currently experiencing that at first hand in Pakistan, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.@@@Yet as the most vulnerable countries we are the ones stepping up our efforts, creating large protection and conservation areas and increasing our adaptation and mitigation efforts, while the biggest carbon emitters and those responsible for the climate catastrophe continue to ignore their obligations.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine not only violated the principles of the Charter of the United Nations but also provoked a humanitarian, fuel and financial crisis that will drive millions of people into food insecurity and poverty.@@@Moreover, the invasion has also threatened our collective security system and provoked renewed division and polarization into geopolitical and economic blocs that pit East against West and North against South.@@@All that is happening at the very moment when we needed to build more bridges and fewer walls, when we should not lose sight of the situations in Yemen and Mali, in Myanmar and Syria, in Libya and Haiti, in Tigray and the Sahel and between Israel and Palestine.@@@The attacks on democracy and human rights, especially those of women and girls, also know no borders.@@@The decline of democracy is evident in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific and my own region, where the situation in Nicaragua demands the urgent attention of the international community to ensure the release of hundreds of political prisoners, the restoration of freedom of expression and the press, civil
society’s right of association and a return to democracy.@@@In terms of rights, the cruellest example can be found in Afghanistan, where for the past year girls above the sixth grade have been forbidden to go to school, leaving them even more exposed to violence, poverty and exploitation.@@@We have come to the General Assembly to identify comprehensive solutions to the multiple crises we face, because it is impossible to end poverty without empowering women and girls, ensure respect for human rights without addressing climate change, and address the reform of the international financial system without new parameters for the allocation of assistance.@@@First, for Costa Rica, the response to the multiple crises we face must be based on a rights and obligations approach.@@@Human rights and unequivocal respect for human dignity and value are not just words.@@@They are obligations undertaken by States, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all our human rights treaties and instruments.@@@They are also the expression of the legitimate and universal aspirations of every person, of all peoples, who after all are the ones who enable us to be in this solemn Hall and to speak on their behalf.@@@Costa Rica too faces challenges and gaps with regard to the full enjoyment of human rights, the building of a culture of peace and non-discrimination and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We are aware that human rights are essential to combating poverty, inequality and exclusion.@@@They are not a stumbling block, and nor should they be.@@@They are nothing less than the only way forward.@@@Costa Rica has never closed its doors to migrants who see in our country a route of passage or a destination to integrate into our society.@@@In 2021, we were fourth in the world in terms of receiving new refugee applications per capita.@@@And we welcome the largest number of Nicaraguan citizens of any country in the world.@@@However, our economic situation and tight finances, together with massive migratory flows, limit our ability to take action and jeopardize the shelter that we always provided to the hundreds of thousands of people who have sought refuge on our soil in the past.@@@It is with a real sense of urgency that we call on the support of the international community to address that challenge, which has been aggravated not only by conflict and poverty but also by the impact of climate change.@@@In a context of multiple and accumulated crises, human rights must forge new paths.@@@Costa Rica welcomed the General Assembly’s recognition on 28 July of the universal right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (resolution 76/300).@@@For my country that is a beacon of hope comparable to the proclamation of the right to water, to development or to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and it is the right response to our triple planetary crisis of pollution, climate change and the loss of biodiversity.@@@The resolution is a point of departure rather than of arrival.@@@Costa Rica will continue to work with Member States, the United Nations and all stakeholders to break down the silo mentality and provide effective solutions to human problems, especially for those who suffer the most — the most vulnerable, marginalized and excluded.@@@True to our commitment to the rights agenda, Costa Rica has decided to submit its candidacy for election to the Human Rights Council for the period from 2023 to 2025.@@@Costa Rica respectfully requests the support of the members of the General Assembly for its candidacy.@@@Our country is an ambitious actor willing to watch over the rights of all people everywhere in the world, as well as a country that will readily commit to dialogue, mutual understanding, cooperation and solidarity in support of humankind.@@@Secondly, human security is key to global security.@@@We find it inconceivable that while millions of people are waiting for life-saving vaccines, medicines or food, the richest countries continue to prioritize spending on arms at the expense of people’s welfare, climate health and equitable recovery.@@@In 2021, global military spending continued to increase for the seventh consecutive year to reach the highest figure ever recorded in history.@@@Today Costa Rica reiterates its call for a gradual and sustained reduction in military spending, because the more weapons we produce, the more weapons will escape even our best efforts to manage and control them.@@@It is about prioritizing the lives and well-being of people and the planet over the profits to be made from weapons and war.@@@It is about investing in and actively building alternative approaches to security, approaches that facilitate cooperation and care rather than competition and violence.@@@We also believe that it is possible to achieve peace and security without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons.@@@Since the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only guarantee against their use or threat of use, Costa Rica urges more States to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as
well as to adhere to the Vienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety and its action plan.@@@We also urge the Russian Federation to cease its attacks on Ukraine and its civilians and critical infrastructure, to demilitarize the Zaporizhzhya plant and not to resort to nuclear coercion, which we condemn in the strongest terms.@@@Costa Rica calls on both parties to ensure respect, at all times and in all circumstances, for international human rights law and international humanitarian law.@@@The third transformative solution must be financial.@@@We middle-income countries face significant inequalities and challenges, such as increased fiscal tightening, which limit our capacity for action and investment and threaten our social fabric.@@@And even though we are home to the highest percentage of poor people and migrants in the world, our categorization does not allow us to access official development assistance or obtain concessional financing on favourable and fair terms.@@@It is therefore vital to go beyond measurements such as gross domestic product per capita with new parameters for the allocation of aid, investment and international cooperation that take into account other aspects, such as structural deficiencies, climate risks, market fluctuations and fiscal stability.@@@The fourth action requires a higher level of ambition and urgency to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.@@@Safeguarding marine resources and the health of the ocean is critical to this end.@@@In the front line against the natural disasters that hit our countries, droughts and heat waves, forest fires and unprecedented floods are people.@@@With them in mind, Costa Rica, together with France and the United Kingdom, is leading the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, which seeks global conservation of 30 per cent of the Earth and 30 per cent of the ocean by 2030.@@@Costa Rica, which has achieved the conservation of 30 per cent of the waters under its national jurisdiction nine years ahead of schedule, invites other States to meet this shared goal.@@@In addition, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, we announced our interest in co-hosting, in 2025, the third United Nations Ocean Conference and in holding a meeting in mid-2024 in Costa Rica that will bring together the scientific community and civil society to formulate innovative solutions for improving ocean governance.@@@The ocean is an immeasurable and critical resource for the continuity of life on Earth.@@@Therefore, on this International Day of Peace, Costa Rica fervently calls for the adoption of a declaration of peace for the ocean.@@@We cannot survive as a species without our ocean.@@@We will not be able to fulfil our various obligations vis-a-vis the Sustainable Development Goals without a healthy ocean.@@@Let us support the Secretary-General’s initiative for a New Agenda for Peace, which strengthens our collective capacity to prevent conflicts and resolve existing ones with sustainable, locally driven solutions.@@@Let us renew the social contract between our Governments and our peoples, anchoring governance arrangements in human rights, trust, inclusion, protection and participation.@@@Let us ensure gender parity and empower women — and in particular girls — in all spheres of life.@@@Let us seek new methods to measure development that adequately reflect such essential aspects as environmental sustainability, inequalities and structural gaps, the quality of institutions and the prevalence of the rule of law.@@@Let us build a more resilient, transparent and inclusive multilateral system and a United Nations that better embraces the needs and perspectives of all, especially within the Security Council.@@@Let us do more to pave the way for the United Nations to fully rise to the occasion, to do all that it has the capacity and determination to do, to help it and our own countries change the course of our common destiny while there is still a destiny to change.@@@Let us act with conviction and courage, with determination and with a real sense of urgency.@@@The time is now.@@@I stand before this global forum at a historic moment for my country, not only because I am the first woman to have the honour of leading our Central American nation, but also because I represent its first democratically elected Government after 13 years of dictatorship; a 2009 coup d’etat fraught with cruel assassinations and death squads; two rounds of electoral fraud; a pandemic and two hurricanes.@@@It is impossible to understand the Honduran people and our huge caravans of migrants without acknowledging the cruel suffering that we have had to endure.@@@But electoral democracy will not be enough to achieve full material and spiritual well-being for our people, after 13 years of dictatorship under the tutelage of the international community multiplied our country’s public debt sixfold and pushed our poverty rate to 74 per cent, the highest in the history of Honduras.@@@Five out of 10 of my compatriots live in extreme poverty.@@@However, it is clear to me that none of those figures will shock anyone in today’s world, where we live under a monetary dictatorship, where the poorest are subjected to draconian fiscal discipline measures that increase the neglected majorities’ suffering and where speculative capital knows no limits.@@@It is clear that for our country to survive today, we must reject the presumed austerity that rewards those who concentrate wealth in the hands of a few as inequality increases exponentially.@@@Since we took office, at the end of January, we have been relentless in seeking consensus and always firmly determined to reach agreements on our compromises without denying them in any way.@@@But attempts to undermine the will of the people are coming at us from every direction, with conspiracies being fomented between the same sectors that plundered the country and their allies in the coup, emboldened by a blatant anti-democratic attitude often disguised as diplomacy.@@@The public policies endorsed by the international financial community’s rentier model over the past 13 years dragged us into a world of violence and poverty characterized by failed and abandoned projects, corruption, looting and drug trafficking.@@@The international witnesses to the electoral fraud that took place in 2013 and 2017 were well aware of what they were condemning our people to, and yet they were complacent about the worst scourge ever to plague our country.@@@The arrogance of capital and narrow self- interest led many to opt for deceit, while organized crime drove the country into darkness.@@@The poor nations of the world will no longer tolerate coups d’etat, the use of so-called lawfare or colour revolutions, which are usually aimed at plundering our wealth of natural resources.@@@The industrialized nations of the world are responsible for the serious deterioration of the environment, yet we are the ones they are forcing to pay for their expensive lifestyles.@@@They stop at nothing to drag us into their schemes and plunge us into an endless crisis, pretending that their hands are tied.@@@The Honduras that I lead is being built based on a vision of a humanist refoundation imbued with dignity and sovereignty.@@@We will take the necessary legal steps to help our environment to recover and share the common good with our entire population.@@@That is why we find the current arbitrary world order to be unacceptable.@@@It perpetuates the existence of third- and fourth-class countries, while those who believe themselves to be civilized never tire of invasions, wars and financial speculation, crucifying us with their inflation time and again.@@@I am here on this rostrum to demand that they respect us.@@@We want to live in peace.@@@Do not keep trying to destabilize Honduras, dictate measures to us or decide with whom we should or should not have relations.@@@The people are sovereign.@@@They showed that on 28 November with their support for my victory, the biggest in the history of my country.@@@On 15 September, our day of independence, the resistance that fought against the dictatorship imposed during the past 13 years supported me en masse in the streets, fighting off public threats and refusing to allow our national assets to continue being handed over to the highest bidder as if we were a no man’s land.@@@Never again will we be branded with the stereotype of banana republic.@@@We will end the monopolies and oligopolies that only impoverish our economy.@@@As a generous people who have shed their blood in defence of our forests and rivers, we will not forget that during the dictatorship hundreds of young people were murdered, including our comrade Berta Caceres.@@@Nor
will we forget the forced disappearances of Hondurans for their attitudes and beliefs, including our five Garifuna comrades who have now been missing for two years.@@@Every inch of the homeland that was usurped in the name of the sacrosanct free market, the Zones for Economic Development and Employment and other privileged regimes was watered with the blood of our indigenous peoples.@@@My social and democratic Government will restore a State of justice and the rule of law so that all of that will never happen again.@@@We are working hard to prioritize incentives and eliminate tax abuses.@@@We have already begun to promote laws on energy as a public good, ensuring workers’ rights and supporting our internal market by investing in agriculture for food security and subsidizing our country’s poorest, who will no longer pay for electric power.@@@We have proposed the renegotiation of free trade agreements.@@@We have taken a sovereign decision to invest in our own development by replacing imports while competing in international markets without subsidizing the excesses of developed nations.@@@We will recognize the importance of women, who have been denied inclusion in development for centuries, as an integral part of the backbone of society.@@@We will provide them, as well as our children and young people, with health care, quality education, security and food sovereignty.@@@For Honduras, each wave of migrants that fled the dictatorship that was in place for more than a decade represented a painful loss for their families and for our country as a whole.@@@The numbers tell us that the exodus provoked by neoliberal injustices only generates more unemployment and shackles us to a deplorable dependency.@@@Paradoxically, those who emigrate from our country generate more foreign- currency income than many of our traditional exports.@@@We express our solidarity with and support for those known as tepesianos.@@@In Honduras, we cannot continue to sustain the hypocrisy of a system that judges crimes linked to drug trafficking, a crime that it has nevertheless supported and facilitated for more than a decade, including through two rounds of electoral fraud and crimes against the nation and millions of Hondurans.@@@For all of those reasons, we will establish an international commission to combat corruption and impunity with the support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.@@@Honduras will have a future only if it takes firm steps to dismantle the neoliberal economic dictatorship.@@@That is why we have already initiated the refoundation of our country and education system with the ideals and values of our national hero, Jose Francisco Morazan Quezada.@@@My Government has begun a process of refoundation and profound change based on four fundamental pillars — first, a revolutionary transformation of education, raising the human spirit and ending colonialism; secondly, building an alternative and profoundly sovereign economic model; thirdly, building a system with the promotion of humanism, solidarity, integration with our brother peoples, peace and respect for human rights at its core; and fourthly, the progressive nationalization of public services such as health care, drinking water, electricity and the Internet.@@@Today, as war is once again punishing the world’s poorest and our countries are invaded, we call for a return to respect for the self-determination of peoples and a rejection of the abominable and brutal blockade of the people of our sister republic of Cuba.@@@It is time to seriously discuss the multipolarity of the world.@@@President Barack Obama took the first steps towards ending that infamy.@@@And as the President of Colombia, Mr. Gustavo Petro, has already stated, the aggression against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela must end.@@@As our comrade Berta Caceres said, the people of the world must wake up.@@@We still have time.@@@As high representatives of our world’s nations gather at this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, our peoples would have been right to expect greater achievement of global peace and prosperous development.@@@Unfortunately, that has not happened.@@@Seventy-seven years have passed since the leaders of the world’s big Powers promised the international community that they would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.@@@The five victorious nations of the Second World War assigned to themselves permanent membership of the Security Council.@@@They assumed the responsibility to implement the promises of the Charter, not only in their own interests, but also on behalf of the many nations that did not choose them and that had no option but to trust them.@@@The state of today’s world does not readily inspire such trust.@@@Instead, it arouses an overwhelming sense of disappointment.@@@It is a disappointment concerning which small countries such as mine would be less than candid, less than honest, if we did not convey our sentiment to the permanent members of the Security Council.@@@We are obliged to ask what happened to the commitments that were chiselled into the Charter of the United Nations as binding obligations on all, but particularly those in the Security Council that took upon themselves the task of guardianship of peace and development.@@@Lest we have forgotten, let my small nation remind all here gathered of those commitments, for they are commitments we took seriously and expected to be fulfilled.@@@The commitments were to practising tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbours; to uniting our strength to maintain international peace and security; to ensuring, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in a common interest; and to employing international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.@@@Our world is now gripped in a fearful atmosphere of economic and financial instability and the worry of expanded warfare.@@@Every nation without exception is confronting escalating inflation, food shortages, high prices and increasing debt.@@@But the worse effects are being suffered by the poor and powerless, the small and exposed.@@@There should be no doubt in the Assembly that trust in the Security Council has been diminished by the actions taken within its membership.@@@Many small and defenceless nations now feel gravely unprotected by the weakening of the international legal order, which was our first, last and only defence against aggression.@@@Even worse, our development prospects and our hard work to rise up from poverty are being retarded by the high prices and severe disruptions that began with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and that are being exacerbated by the war on Ukraine.@@@Therefore, we call on the permanent members of the Security Council to recommit themselves to the role that they assumed and pledged to safeguard.@@@Peace must be restored for the world’s sake and should be restored soon.@@@It is the permanent members of the Security Council — all of them — that have that primary obligation.@@@To abandon that obligation in the pursuit of selfish desires legitimizes the call for reform and an expansion of the Security Council.@@@Concerted action by the Security Council is necessary to prevent major human rights violations, stop ongoing breaches and address global conflicts.@@@If that fails to happen with the urgency that is required, it may call for the General Assembly to initiate its own global actions and to authorize their implementation.@@@I do not anticipate that this call for action by the General Assembly would be welcomed by the permanent members of the Security Council, and that is fine.@@@However, each of them must understand the deep concern of other nations when the Council is dysfunctional on issues whose effects are global.@@@Peace in the world is not a commodity to be traded; it is a right to be protected in the interest of all.@@@That observation is also strongly pertinent to the issue of climate change, which poses an existential threat to small island States and countries with low- lying coastlines.@@@We will all recall that, last December, due to a veto by one of the five permanent members, the Security Council had to reject a draft resolution (S/2021/990) framing the problem of climate change
as a threat to international peace and security (see S/PV.8926).@@@That was extremely unfortunate.@@@That draft resolution was sponsored by 113 Member States, representing the second highest number of countries to support a draft resolution in the history of the Security Council, yet it was vetoed.@@@Is it fair that the evidence-based draft resolution, which emanated from the concerns and anxieties of so large a host of nations, should be vetoed by a single country?@@@Climate change remains the single greatest common threat to all humankind, and more so for small island developing States (SIDS), which lack the financial resources to adapt to the mortal shocks and to rebuild in their aftermath.@@@SIDS have a legitimate and urgent concern, for although collectively we contribute the least to carbon dioxide emissions — a mere 0.2 per cent — we are the greatest victims, not only because of unattended loss and damage to our lives and livelihoods, but also because the very existence of our countries is fatally endangered.@@@The effects of global warming are universal.@@@They reach every country, but it is vital that we all understand that, inasmuch as global warming is universal, its damaging effects are not the same.@@@The burden falls mostly on the poor in small developing nations, such as mine.@@@And that is why, as the representative of the people of Antigua and Barbuda, I must stand up for their rights, including their right to livelihoods and to life.@@@My voice cannot be stilled while danger gathers in the skies above my small and vulnerable country.@@@I have no choice but to fight unrelentingly for climate justice, and that is precisely what I shall do.@@@Many are beginning to lose faith in the Security Council.@@@We must not be forced to lose faith also in the collective authority of the General Assembly.@@@That is why my Government urges the Assembly to act on behalf of the smallest and most powerless among us, and in the interest of global justice.@@@An opportunity for action looms.@@@It is the draft resolution being sought by Vanuatu from the Assembly in the coming months to request the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion that will clarify the legal obligations of States to protect human rights and environments from climate change.@@@If our nations are indeed gravely concerned about the ravages of climate change, which has spared no country, they will support Vanuatu’s request.@@@Not to support the Vanuatu draft resolution would be a vote to circumvent a decision on the legal obligations of each nation.@@@Not to support the Vanuatu draft resolution would be a vote to prolong this period of abuse, thereby imperilling human civilization.@@@I also draw attention to an initiative taken by my own country, Antigua and Barbuda, in solidarity with Tuvalu and Palau.@@@We are three small island States that have been buffeted and battered by the effects of climate change.@@@On the eve of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP), held in Glasgow last year, we launched the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law.@@@The Commission’s purpose is to develop and implement fair and just global environmental norms and practices.@@@In that connection, it will seek an opinion from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea regarding the binding obligations of its member States to mitigate the effects of their greenhouse gas emissions or to pay for the loss and damage they cause.@@@The polluter must pay.@@@That effort is separate from, but complementary to, the Vanuatu initiative.@@@Our small countries have talked ourselves hoarse since the 1980s, pointing to the parlous circumstances into which our people and our countries are being plunged, but to little avail.@@@Billions have been pledged in climate finance and not delivered.@@@Promises have been repeated year after year, each with a zealousness that, on the evidence, has been meant to placate and divert, but clearly not to perform or to deliver commensurate with the loss suffered and the damage caused.@@@The stage now seems set for this year’s COP27 to fail, despite the genuine efforts of some industrialized nations to address the grave concerns of the majority of the world’s people to turn climate change into climate action.@@@The Group of 20, meeting on 31 August, failed to produce a joint statement on climate change, sending an ominous signal that, yet again, the meeting of the COP in November will be long on words but very short on deeds.@@@At COP26 in Glasgow last year, world leaders acknowledged that their pledges to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions have not met the previously agreed goal of pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.@@@They vowed to do better.@@@It appears now that they will not.@@@And that is despite the fact that, as Secretary-General Guterres has observed, we are in a climate emergency that is literally setting our planet on fire.@@@In other words, they are burning down the planet.@@@Therefore, small States, individually and collectively, under the Antigua and Barbuda chairmanship of the Alliance of Small Island States, will attend COP27 in
Egypt and argue strenuously to establish a new loss- and-damage response fund.@@@But we recognize that reliance on the conscience of others will not be enough and may not produce the results we and the world urgently need.@@@We have been patient.@@@We have urged.@@@We have pleaded.@@@We have begged.@@@And yet, year after year, small island States bear the overwhelming burden of climate change’s catastrophic effects, including persistent destruction, the repeated costs of rebuilding and huge debts to finance resilience.@@@That injustice must end, and it must end now.@@@We insist that those States most responsible for this dire situation respect their obligations to stop global warming and to provide compensation to its victims.@@@We will engage fully and constructively at COP27.@@@We will also use all means necessary to pursue the objectives of the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law and we invite all countries whose peoples, lives and livelihoods are at great risk, to join us.@@@While I have focused my statement so far on the damaging effects of climate change on SIDS, let it not be believed that the industrialized nations, the rich and the powerful, are immune.@@@The projections of our common future are deeply distressing.@@@In this year alone, temperatures rose above 40°C in Britain, Spain, France and Portugal.@@@China recorded the most severe heatwave anywhere on Earth.@@@Floods hit Pakistan with nearly 800 per cent more rainfall than normal, affecting tens of millions of people and leaving a third of the country under water.@@@These are the realities that we have to deal with.@@@Winter temperatures in the southern hemisphere rose above 45°C in South America, while temperatures in some parts of Antarctica were almost 40°C higher than average.@@@Last year, natural disasters in the United States inflicted an estimated $145 billion in damage and killed nearly 700 people.@@@And this year was no better.@@@So the question is: What else needs to happen in order to force urgent action?@@@Even if some of the Governments of the industrialized nations remain reluctant to curb greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of the most vulnerable globally, they should be motivated by the perils for their own people.@@@At the end of the day, we are all in this this thing together, and while SIDS will suffer more swiftly and greater, no nation will escape.@@@A global, all-of-society response is required to effectively combat climate change.@@@There is no other viable option.@@@I therefore plead with all Governments to act on the evidence and to do all in their power to curb greenhouse gas emissions to stop climate change.@@@I turn now to other international conditions that have unfairly delayed the economic development and social progress of SIDS.@@@I will start with the Cuban embargo imposed by the United States that is hampering the Cuban people in their collective efforts to achieve economic and social development.@@@That unjust embargo is seriously undermining Cuba’s efforts to eliminate poverty and improve the living standards of its people.@@@The Government of Antigua and Barbuda urges the United States to immediately lift the 60-year economic embargo against Cuba and allow the 11 million Cubans an opportunity to be prosperous and a fair chance at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to the normalization of relations between the United States and Venezuela in the interest of hemispheric peace and prosperity.@@@The incongruous criterion applied by international financial and development institutions and the Governments that control their policies to classify some SIDS, such as mine, in the same category as the United States, Japan and Germany because of the skewed measurement of high per capita income is one such condition that is undermining our development.@@@For decades, my small country has been denied access to concessional financing because of that single criterion.@@@The criterion of high per capita income also fails to take into account the structural limitations to include limited natural resources and the reality that we are compelled to import a large percentage of our goods for consumption.@@@For our people to survive and to pay for the high cost of even basic imports, their earning capacity must align with the costs they confront.@@@In that connection, my Government is thankful to the former President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, for establishing the High-level Panel of Experts to, inter alia, provide recommendations on the potential development, finalization and use of the multidimensional vulnerability index for small island developing States.@@@We also thank Secretary-General Guterres for the proactive stance that he has taken on the index in finding lasting solutions to the barriers that prevent access to concessional financing to SIDS.@@@I was honoured, on behalf of the people of Antigua and Barbuda, to be appointed as a co-Chair of the High- level Panel, along with the former Prime Minister of Norway, Her Excellency Ms. Erna Solberg.@@@It is our intention that the report and recommendations of the panel will be factual and evidence-based and will open the way for indicators that better reflect the vulnerabilities and challenges faced by small island developing States.@@@For too long, the persistent use of per capita income as the primary criterion for determining access to concessional or grant resources has denied small and vulnerable countries, such as mine, access to concessional financing and tailored debt relief measures.@@@I call on the General Assembly and all its participants to seize the opportunity to correct a wrong that has persisted far too long and that has punished middle- and high-income SIDS that have performed well economically and politically despite the odds that are stacked against them.@@@It is time to stop penalizing SIDS for good performance.@@@It is time to reward and incentivize them so that they can improve their accomplishments, achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen their ability to respond to endogenous and exogenous shocks.@@@A consequence of the disasters spawned by climate change and the locked door to concessional financing for many SIDS is high, unsustainable debt.@@@Many of our countries have been forced to resort to the commercial lending market to borrow in order to rebuild after disasters.@@@We were also forced to do so after the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The international financial institutions and the Governments that control them are well aware that our debt burden is unsustainable, and yet the Paris Club will not reschedule debt or engage about ways to ease the burden.@@@Our options are to acquire more debt and more onerous interest rates from the commercial lending market, or to surrender, literally, by imposing burdensome taxing conditions on our people.@@@It is no choice at all.@@@One is as difficult as the other and each consigns our small nations to struggle.@@@Many of us have done so and will continue to do so to survive and not to submit to demands to make the lives of our people harder.@@@The international community bears responsibility for these blights upon our small countries, which we did not create.@@@The time is upon us to change the direction in how the international community responds to SIDS.@@@In 2024, Antigua and Barbuda will host the fourth International Conference on SIDS, a conference that must deliver for all small island developing States — a conference unlike any other.@@@We cannot do this alone; we need each and every Member State, starting now, to begin the process of recommitting to SIDS and offer lasting solutions to our needs.@@@We did not start wars.@@@We created no pandemic.@@@We did not cause climate change.@@@Is it not right for the rich nations of the world to contribute to alleviating the problems that have been thrust upon small developing States?@@@The theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@The Assembly is indeed meeting at a watershed moment.@@@The world is dominated now by a conflict that is not in the developing world but very much in the developed world, and an expression of the underlying suspicions that have continued to exist between the nations of the East and the West.@@@The effects of the conflict, exposed by the war on Ukraine, have reached every nation.@@@Therefore, we have a legitimate interest in it and a right to call on all the parties, Russia on the one hand and the NATO and European Union countries on the other, to employ their diplomatic resources and skills to end this globally debilitating war.@@@Interlocked with the severe challenges of the conflict are climate change, the lingering economic effects of COVID-19, growing economic inequality between nations, high debt burdens without relief and persistent poverty.@@@These interconnected challenges demand meaningful international cooperation — not just words, but deeds.@@@At this watershed moment, I plead with the Assembly, please let us turn words into collective action.@@@The Organization has a clear purpose, as spelled out in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations, and to achieve international cooperation.@@@Today, most Member States would probably agree that we are still far from achieving that goal.@@@But that does not mean we should not try.@@@Each and every Member of the United Nations has a responsibility to protect peace.@@@In this, the permanent members of the Security Council have a special duty.@@@Instead, today we see one of the five permanent members openly denying the right of another United Nations Member, Ukraine, to exist as an independent State.@@@Those who break the rules themselves have no authority to set rules for others through the power of veto.@@@The wrongs of Russia’s aggression could not be clearer.@@@One hundred forty-one countries deplored Moscow’s war against Ukraine in General Assembly resolution ES-11/1.@@@No veto in the Security Council can change the fundamental truth that today, rather than protecting global peace, Russia is doing everything to undo it.@@@Moscow’s aggression has inflicted harm on the entire world.@@@Thousands of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed.@@@Millions have had to leave their homes, triggering one of the largest refugee crises in Europe’s history.@@@Fifty million people are on the brink of starvation in Africa and Asia.@@@Russia’s blockage of Ukraine’s ports and confiscation of its harvest have made the already grave global food crisis even worse.@@@We welcome the deal mediated by Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye and we call on Russia to fully unblock all Ukraine’s ports.@@@Otherwise, the world will continue to suffer.@@@The democratic world and all of us must be a voice for Ukraine — the voice that will not be silent and that will continue to testify about Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.@@@We must be the voice that will remember and that will act so that no one is ever allowed to commit such atrocities again.@@@Vladimir Putin hoped to conquer Ukraine and scare the rest of us.@@@In that goal he has failed, as Ukraine’s recent successes on the battlefield demonstrate.@@@We will rebuild peace.@@@To do so, we must learn from our past mistakes.@@@This is not the first time we have seen aggression in Europe.@@@Russia has occupied parts of
Georgia since 2008 and parts of Ukraine since 2014.@@@Our response to those actions was incomplete.@@@Concerns about our own comfort weakened our resolve.@@@The tepid sanctions we imposed failed to discourage Russia from trying again.@@@Our weakness encouraged more aggression.@@@We must not repeat the same mistake again.@@@The flouting of rules is poisoning global security, and it must not be allowed to stand.@@@More than 50 countries, including all members of the European Union, have already imposed tough sanctions on Russia.@@@Slovakia is Ukraine’s direct neighbour.@@@Our own security is impacted by this war.@@@We are neither the biggest nor the richest country in the world.@@@We have long been dependent on Russia’s energy supplies.@@@But we chose the protection of our fundamental rights.@@@We have imposed sanctions on Russia and are supporting Ukraine, including through military aid, because Ukraine’s fight is just and defensive, and in line with international law.@@@I invite all Member States to join.@@@We should all help Ukraine politically, militarily and financially because that is the only way we can restore peace.@@@The war in Ukraine is not the only crisis exposing the gap between the rules and commitments we have agreed on and their practical realization.@@@In November, we will hold the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Egypt.@@@But our actions lag dangerously behind our words.@@@Our greenhouse gas emissions are not falling fast enough.@@@How much more scorched Earth, how many millions more climate refugees, how many flood victims will it take to convince us that ignoring our commitments is no longer an option?@@@We are desperately behind in cutting our emissions.@@@Worse, we hear voices arguing that the climate crisis must wait because of increasing energy prices.@@@That would be a grave mistake.@@@Yes, the price increases are painful, and we must help those who risk losing access to energy, but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture.@@@We are talking about the rising prices of commodities that we must phase out anyway to stop the planet’s warming.@@@Rather than bring back subsidies for coal or gas, we must transition away from them.@@@Renewable energy is less dependent on those who are trying to use gas or oil as an energy weapon.@@@And it is cheaper.@@@Despite the current energy crisis, Slovakia will stop using coal as a source of energy next year.@@@We are investing in renewables and launching a retrofitting programme for buildings to boost energy efficiency because the cheapest energy is the one you do not use.@@@We can only do this together, globally and in solidarity with each other.@@@We need all big economies to join and help those who need it.@@@At this year’s COP27, we will need a significant increase of funds for lower- and middle-income countries.@@@Many of them contribute very little to our planet’s heating but suffer the most from its consequences.@@@As the world community, we have put short-term comfort over lasting solutions when it comes to two crises: that of international peace and order, and that of our climate.@@@But there is a third crisis of relativization of values, facts and expertise, as well as a decrease of trust in democratic institutions.@@@We are facing an epidemic of lies, propaganda and disinformation.@@@It is hardly new, but thanks to the rise of social media, it is more powerful.@@@If algorithms favour hatred over truth or nonsense over science, and if they appeal to our instincts rather than the greater good, what hope is there for global understanding or for the sort of cooperation that the United Nations was created to advance?@@@Democracies are tolerant by default, but they die if they start tolerating intolerance.@@@Along with the rest of the European Union, Slovakia leads the way for an effective and democratic regulation of major social platforms and online media.@@@Online space should be guided by the same democratic rules that apply offline.@@@We welcome United Nations initiatives for rules for State behaviour in cyberspace.@@@The efforts towards a so-called Digital Geneva Convention are justified and needed.@@@The crises I mention have a disproportionate impact on women and girls.@@@That plays out in higher rates of gender-based and domestic violence, greater economic insecurity and poverty or worse access to education and health care.@@@However, I am not here to portray women as victims.@@@I am here to call on all of them to step up their engagement in public affairs.@@@Women are agents of change.@@@The world has a collective responsibility to support them because we are already seeing the consequences of a world that is run without taking their unique and diverse experience into proper account.@@@Time has not been very favourable to the ideas that built and sustain the Organization.@@@The peace we should safeguard is fraying.@@@The international cooperation we should foster has not prevented a climate catastrophe.@@@And the spirit of shared global commons that the United
Nations embodies is under attack from extremists, their voice multiplied by new technologies.@@@Half measures are not enough to cope with those challenges.@@@We have tried that before.@@@It is time for action and for clarity.@@@We, the Members of the United Nations, need to clearly side with victim over aggressor.@@@We must choose the international rules-based order over the power of the gun.@@@We must urgently deliver on our climate goals and find working rules for social media platforms to protect the fabric of our societies and the international order.@@@Sure, we can delay and compromise.@@@But again, history teaches us that passivity and ignorance never solve crises; they only delay the moment of reckoning.@@@And since obeying even the smallest of rules matters, let me finish here to respect the agreed time limit.@@@Let me say how pleased I am to be here now after more than two years since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@This unprecedented health crisis exposed our shortcomings in multilateral coordination and cooperation.@@@It forced us to take extraordinary economic and social measures — both to protect our populations and to mobilize the international monetary system.@@@Our frantic pace of daily life makes us forget that each year in the northern hemisphere the overshoot day, which arrives earlier and earlier, alerts us to our imposition on the planet, whose resources we are inexorably exhausting.@@@The theme the President has chosen for this general debate is therefore a reminder that we are at a decisive turning point that requires transformative solutions in order to face the interdependent challenges before us.@@@Allow me to express my sincere congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and to thank his predecessor for demonstrating the leadership of a small island developing State.@@@We share his belief in the need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which we collectively defined in 2015, and thus preserve our environment and ensure the survival of humankind.@@@This seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly marks a decisive year for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace.@@@I pledge the full support of the Principality of Monaco in the preparation of the important deadlines to come.@@@I am thinking, in particular, of the United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action, the SDG Summit and the Summit of the Future in 2024.@@@Exactly 100 years ago, Prince Albert I, my great- great-grandfather, passed away.@@@This humanist and visionary monarch was a tireless advocate of the fundamental role of science in advancing our societies, especially in the context of political decision-making.@@@A century later, we commemorate his legacy, which continues to inspire my action and the policy of my Government.@@@Monaco assumes its full share in the collective effort to preserve our planet at a time when the world is going through a pivotal period that is disrupting our way of life and international relations.@@@The globalization we are experiencing has accentuated our interdependence but also the relationship between man and nature.@@@Ecosystems are now unable to regenerate themselves because of our production methods, which are based mainly on the use of natural resources, and because our frantic pace of consumption.@@@The fact that the year 2020 marked the only pause in the degradation of ecosystems at the global level speaks volumes about what we are collectively capable of accomplishing, for better or for worse, in a well- thought-out manner or in an emergency.@@@Indeed, during this emergency, research and innovation enabled the rapid production of vaccines, which we welcome.@@@Public health issues and preparedness for future pandemics remain a priority, as does equitable access to prevention and care.@@@I attach particular importance to the fact that my country is mobilizing within the framework of its international cooperation policy, alongside its partners, first and foremost the World Health Organization, in order to strengthen the global health architecture.@@@We will therefore carefully examine any new crisis management mechanism that could facilitate a coordinated response based on proven scientific facts in order to avoid repeating the difficulties encountered at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@For more than three decades, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been warning us about the disastrous and often irreversible effects of climate change.@@@In June 2022, at the Stockholm and Lisbon Conferences, we once again saw the intrinsic link between the well-being of human civilization and respect for the planet, of which the ocean is one of the fundamental components.@@@The protection of our seas and oceans is part of a family tradition, a cause to which Prince Albert
I dedicated his life.@@@His commitment set an example for me — an example that continues to live on in my country’s commitments and which I myself have chosen to follow since my accession to the throne in 2005.@@@Beyond our rhetoric, it is time for action, which is nothing less than seizing the last opportunity we have to build a future for humankind.@@@As extreme climate events multiply, affecting all nations indiscriminately but particularly penalizing the most vulnerable, strengthening adaptation measures must be at the heart of our priorities.@@@My heart goes out to the people of Pakistan who are suffering the consequences of terrible floods.@@@These urgent and necessary efforts must be carried out in concert with policies to drastically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.@@@Each country, according to its own circumstances and needs, must transform its economy in depth to decarbonize it and contain the rise in temperatures.@@@Monaco remains resolutely committed to environmental protection and sustainable development.@@@In this respect, the Principality is pursuing its energy transition to achieve a 55 per cent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.@@@In this respect, the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is very clear: the tools and solutions to build a sustainable and fairer future for future generations already exist.@@@We are the actors.@@@We have a duty of solidarity to succeed collectively in this energy transition.@@@The upcoming deadlines in 2022, both within the Climate Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity, must allow us to truly lay the foundations for a sustainable society.@@@Faced with such challenges, our common failure would simply be unacceptable.@@@Prince Albert I was, in my eyes, an example of openness to others, a man eager to learn and listen to the most avant-garde minds.@@@By giving the Principality a constitution, he made it a State governed by the rule of law.@@@As the First World War approached, he tried to convince the future belligerents to find a peaceful solution to their differences.@@@Today, while many conflicts continue to spread terror, misery and helplessness in the world without our being able to put an end to them, war has unfortunately returned to the European continent.@@@The military aggression against Ukraine blatantly disregards international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter, undermining the security and stability of Europe and the world.@@@It is also inflicting untold suffering on the Ukrainian people, taking us back to the darkest hours of our history.@@@I therefore welcome the conclusion of an agreement, under the auspices of the United Nations, that allows the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and I urge all stakeholders to respect the terms of the agreement.@@@Global food security, already precarious, depends on it.@@@Nor should we forget that women and children remain the first victims of food shortages, exacerbating the vicious and intergenerational circle of poverty.@@@Monaco has made this issue one of its cooperation priorities and devotes nearly one third of its official development assistance to it.@@@We are resolutely committed in the long term to fighting against malnutrition, supporting small local producers and school canteens and developing sustainable agricultural sectors.@@@The extreme tensions that continue to grow — and we all know the quite appalling number of conflicts and civil wars taking place around the world — force us to overhaul our agenda for peace.@@@In his address, President Macron also mentioned the very high number of these civil wars (see A/77/PV.4).@@@The profound change marked by globalization is now followed by the digitalization of our societies.@@@If there is one area in which the private sector has the lead, it is that of information and communication technologies.@@@In this respect, we must reconcile the development of these technologies with the protection of human rights and personal data.@@@The summit that brought us together at the beginning of the week demonstrated that new technologies are the basis for the transformation of education.@@@We must make good use of them to adapt education systems to the world of today and tomorrow.@@@I thank the Secretary- General for this initiative, which saw the participation of many young people.@@@Cyberspace must not become a place of confrontation but rather an additional opportunity for cooperation.@@@The proliferation of hate speech and disinformation is simply intolerable.@@@Artificial intelligence must serve humans and not manipulate their behaviour and thoughts.@@@It is high time that we manage to set common rules so that cyberspace does not get out of hand, destroy our democracies and further separate us from each other.@@@By the end of the general debate of this seventy- seventh session, more than two thirds of the members of the General Assembly will have been represented by their Head of State or Government.@@@I wish to see this as an affirmation of the indispensable role of the United Nations, the Charter and multilateral diplomacy.@@@We must redouble our efforts and restore confidence so that, as the Preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims:
“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world...”.@@@A strengthened and effective multilateralism, in which youth and women play a prominent role, is the most effective way to address global crises.@@@For women are essential agents of change: gender equality and women’s economic autonomy are the foundation of a more sustainable world.@@@What are we waiting for to promote their place in global leadership?@@@Monaco intends to pursue its commitment within UN-Women and through its development-cooperation policy.@@@My delegation intends to contribute fully to the work of our United Nations, to build together a more efficient and inclusive multilateralism, working for the well-being of humankind and the planet.@@@The United Nations and its principles, which we established after the Second World War, are in grave danger.@@@One of the presumed gatekeepers of the Charter of the United Nations — one of the permanent members of the Security Council, Russia — is attacking a sovereign neighbouring democracy and wreaking havoc in Eastern Europe and the entire world.@@@If we continue to allow a new colonial war, then why are we here?@@@Why do we keep the United Nations alive?@@@Do we care or are we indifferent?@@@The Czech Government’s foreign policy is guided by the legacy of our former President Vaclav Havel — a globally respected human rights defender and renowned politician, who once said,
“Our indifference towards others can, after all, result in only one thing — the indifference of others towards us”.@@@The fact that representatives of all States Members of the United Nations meet here to address major global challenges demonstrates that we are not indifferent to the suffering of others.@@@It shows that we care.@@@The circumstances have changed dramatically since the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly.@@@The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally shaken the international order.@@@On 24 February, not only Europe but also the whole world entered a new era.@@@Russia tried to dismantle the security architecture of the European continent by launching a colonial war of conquest.@@@Ironically, President Putin is declaring partial mobilization and threatening the world with the use of nuclear weapons today — the International Day of Peace.@@@What more proof do we need?@@@That is our terrifying new reality.@@@Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine not only blatantly violates the United Nations Charter but also badly damages the global economy and the food security of many countries represented in the General Assembly Hall.@@@It seriously threatens the rules-based international order and harms all States Members of the United Nations.@@@I am shocked to the core, listening to Russian State-controlled television channels, preaching the strategy of hunger and cold towards Ukraine and the world and approving the torture and mass killing of civilians, with the argument that the world must fear Russia.@@@Russia must immediately cease its military actions and withdraw all its troops from the entire territory of Ukraine.@@@Russia’s complete disregard for the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly is appalling.@@@Czechia resolutely supports Ukraine’s right to defend its territorial integrity and population, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.@@@Czechia fully supports the sovereignty, unity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@We will never recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea.@@@We condemn in the strongest possible terms the upcoming sham referendums to be held in parts of the territory of Ukraine.@@@We resolutely reject attempts to create spheres of influence instead of equal partnerships.@@@The time of establishing colonies and acquiring territory by the sheer force of arms is over.@@@Today it is Ukraine; tomorrow it could be any of us.@@@We refuse a world of Russian colonial appetite.@@@We are horrified by the atrocities committed by the Russian invader.@@@We condemn the existence of filtration camps run by Russia and the horrors in Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin, Izyum and many other places in Ukraine, as well as the apocalyptic shelling of civilian infrastructure.@@@Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens have been deported to Russia, including children.@@@Children were forcibly taken from their parents.@@@It reminds us of the worst practices of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.@@@All those reports on Russian military conduct must be independently investigated.@@@Russia must respect its obligations under international humanitarian law.@@@Russia has an international responsibility for the aggression, but there is also an individual criminal responsibility for the crimes committed on such a large scale by Russian troops.@@@We will hold all war criminals accountable.@@@Czechia supported the referral to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation of the situation on the ground in Ukraine.@@@We also strongly support Ukraine’s application instituting
proceedings against the Russian Federation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide before the International Court of Justice.@@@And we call for the establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression committed by Putin’s Russia.@@@Apart from that, we support Ukraine comprehensively.@@@Czechia hosts the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita — more than 400,000 in a country of 10 million.@@@We provide large amounts of humanitarian aid.@@@We support the stabilization, recovery and reconstruction efforts of the Ukrainian Government — not only with words but with action.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has only strengthened my country’s resolve to continue supporting independent media, civil society and human rights defenders.@@@Unfortunately, inside Russia the human rights situation of freedom-loving citizens has worsened enormously.@@@We successfully ran for the Human Rights Council seat vacated by Russia in May.@@@I would like to express thanks for the broad support that we received from many of Member States.@@@We warmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Volker Turk as the new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.@@@I wish to thank former High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet for her dedicated work during her term in office.@@@The most recent report on China prepared by her Office shed light on the alarming human rights violations against Muslim groups, including Uyghurs.@@@Unfortunately, the human rights situations in countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iran, Myanmar and Venezuela also continue to worsen.@@@We wish Myanmar would work towards a peaceful resolution of the current crisis.@@@We follow with horror the atrocious manner in which the Iranian authorities handle the rightful protests of women.@@@In Belarus, the regime uses brutal violence against its opponents.@@@In the past two years, tens of thousands of Belarussians have been detained and all independent media and civil society organizations have been destroyed.@@@We are concerned that anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial are on the rise.@@@This year marks 80 years since the infamous Wannsee Conference and the formulation of the so-called “final solution to the Jewish question”, which resulted in the murder of nearly 6 million Jews.@@@Czechia reiterates Israel’s right to protect its citizens against any terrorist activities that deliberately target Israeli civilians, including rocket attacks.@@@Czechia currently holds the presidency of the European Union (EU).@@@Our priorities, such as defending Ukraine, ensuring energy security and promoting democracy and human rights, are not only regional but also global in nature.@@@Russian aggression has only multiplied the already existing global challenges.@@@Progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has slowed down.@@@The prices of agriculture commodities are growing globally.@@@For us, working with young people and listening to their concerns is the driving force to get progress on the SDGs back on track.@@@Climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss are major global challenges.@@@We need a comprehensive humanitarian, development-oriented and peace-based response to crises, including pandemics, as well as solutions that foster sustainable food systems and climate resilience.@@@It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the World Health Organization can work effectively and independently of any political influence.@@@No one should be left behind.@@@We firmly support the global efforts for equal access to vaccines and treatment.@@@The stakes are high for the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt.@@@It has been said many times before, but I will reiterate it once again: if we do not act now, it may soon be too late,
The development of relations between the European Union and Africa is among the priorities of the Czech EU presidency.@@@Africa faces food shortages, the negative impacts of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The Russian aggression against Ukraine has blocked the exports of agricultural products.@@@I cannot but express my outrage at how Russian disinformation propaganda seeks to use the food crisis in Africa to spread false narratives that the EU sanctions
against Russia caused the shortage.@@@Obviously, if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, we would not have had to deal with that issue at all.@@@Turning to other security issues, we are concerned about the increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait caused by unilateral threatening actions.@@@We expect cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, while the status quo is maintained.@@@The digital space carries many opportunities, but there are risks too: cyberattacks and cybercrime, the misuse of technology and in particular disinformation.@@@Let me say this loud and clear — a lie is not an opinion.@@@For far too long, we have overlooked the spread of disinformation directed against our common values.@@@Let us not forget the COVID-related disinformation.@@@We had to learn the hard way when disinformation began to cost human lives.@@@That is why we need to make sure that our citizens and societies are resilient and that independent media operate freely.@@@We will continue to reach out and help countries exposed to lies and propaganda.@@@Czechia promotes the concept of digital humanism, which keeps human interests and needs at the centre of emerging technologies.@@@Instances of Internet shutdowns are growing.@@@We must maintain a free, open, safe, secure and stable cyberspace, in which human rights apply online as they do offline.@@@The number of cyberattacks, including State-sponsored cyberattacks, continues to rise, as does their severity.@@@The new potential of terrorist threat has appeared with the escalation of Russia’s aggressive policies.@@@Terrorism maliciously feeds on weak governance, economic hardship and social injustice, with the Sahel region being the most-affected region.@@@Czechia reiterates its commitment to countering terrorism and supporting countries that suffer from terrorist violence or threats.@@@I would like to use this opportunity to remind Russia that Czechia still awaits its official response concerning the explosion that occurred in an ammunition depot in my country in 2014.@@@That completely appalling act was planned and executed by agents of GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, and claimed the lives of two innocent Czech citizens, in addition to the material damage caused.@@@Such conduct is a clear violation of international law.@@@The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is also negatively impacted by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.@@@Russia does not hesitate to use dangerous nuclear rhetoric, which has become a new standard for terrorizing peaceful populations.@@@Czechia strongly denounces Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.@@@Any armed attack on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).@@@We regret that, despite lengthy negotiations, it was not possible to achieve consensus on a final outcome document at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) because Russia opposed it.@@@And we call on Iran to act urgently to fulfil its legal obligations under its NPT Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and to clarify all outstanding issues.@@@We commend the IAEA and its Director General for their professional work in verifying Iran’s safeguards obligations.@@@The United Nations, this universal Organization, has a duty to help us better react to existing and emerging global challenges.@@@But in these dark and stormy times, it has the duty to firmly defend the principles it was founded on — the Charter of the United Nations, human rights and the rules-based international order.@@@I am speaking here for the first time as Canada’s Foreign Minister as we gather in the Assembly Hall on the traditional territory of the Lenape people.@@@The Secretary-General has said that we are in rough seas; that a winter of global discontent is on the horizon; that we have a duty to act.@@@I agree with him.@@@From Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and the impacts around the world, to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, to climate change, to severe the conflicts and hardships that now affect billions of people, the challenges we are facing are immense.@@@These crises and the way we choose to respond to them are testing our shared commitment to the United Nations.@@@That is why our decisions matter more than ever.@@@We have a choice — either we respect and defend the rules that we, collectively, have developed for generations and that have given us the longest period of peace in modern history, or we accept that rules can be broken by the powerful, bringing us back to darker times of constant tensions and conflicts, with massive displacements, suffering and losses of human lives.@@@For Canada, the choice is clear.@@@We are convinced that we need more multilateralism, not less.@@@We need more of the United Nations, not less.@@@We need a United Nations that is effective, efficient, relevant and accountable.@@@Throughout its history, Canada has strived to act as an honest broker, ready to build bridges between nations and differing points of view.@@@We have worked tirelessly over the years to conceive, develop and strengthen the international system that we now know.@@@We will continue to do so, and we will do it with all United Nations Members.@@@Last week, the Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, met with leaders and civil society members from around the world.@@@Canada has been listening, and we hear them.@@@Many described and condemned Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine as brutal, illegal and unjustified — as a violation of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We agree with them.@@@Many described the uneven recovery from the global
COVID-19 pandemic not only as incompatible with simple fairness, but also as a danger to public health.@@@Again, we agree with them.@@@They shared profound concern that the that achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals is at risk.@@@And we agree we must address that head on.@@@People from all corners of the globe clearly said that climate change is no longer on the horizon.@@@It is here, and it is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.@@@That is undeniable.@@@The hearts of all Canadians go out to those affected by the devastating floods in Pakistan, as well as to our fellow citizens who found themselves in the destructive path of Hurricane Fiona.@@@Many conversations this week have focused on the harsh fact that more people are displaced by conflict and violence today than at any point in human history.@@@I heard unmistakable appeals for accountability, including for the victims of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 .@@@Women and girls described their need to have control over their own futures and their own bodies, which is their right.@@@Brave individuals shared deeply personal testimonies of their painful experiences of sexual violence in conflict.@@@We believe them.@@@Such violence is unacceptable, and it must change.@@@We must empower survivors in leading the path to their recovery and support them in the pursuit of meaningful justice, freedom of speech, disinformation and misinformation, the protection of minorities, the rule of law, and respect for science, facts and evidence.@@@Powerful statements have been made on those issues this week.@@@They speak to an erosion of civic space and democratic dialogue.@@@Canada hears them.@@@We do not come to these discussions with easy fixes.@@@We have come to listen, to engage and to share our commitment to responding to this moment in a positive way, with purpose and in a spirit of global solidarity.@@@The world has heard horrible stories of Ukrainians losing loved ones to this outrageous, senseless war.@@@The Assembly has spoken clearly and with conviction that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine violates the United Nations Charter.@@@It strikes at the heart of the commitments we all made in building the Organization from the ashes of the Second World War.@@@Rather than abide by the Assembly’s decisions and a legally binding order from the International Court of Justice, Russia has doubled down, including with a desperate effort to justify the unjustifiable.@@@While the world gathered here in New York to pursue solutions for the greatest challenges of our time, President Putin informed us that he will conscript more young people into his war of choice.@@@He threatened our collective security with reckless and dangerous nuclear rhetoric.@@@For Putin, this is a war to the death.@@@For Ukraine, this is a war for life.@@@Russia’s war machine has caused enormous civilian suffering and destruction in Ukraine.@@@The mass graves discovered in Izyum are the latest demonstration of Putin’s utter disregard for human life.@@@The impacts of this illegal war are profoundly felt around the world.@@@We must address the global food security crisis and other consequences of the illegal invasion with imagination and determination.@@@And those who break the law must be met with the force of the law.@@@A permanent seat on the Security Council is not a license to kill or to silence anyone, and it should never guarantee impunity.@@@We are facing major crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, conflict.@@@Crises that were once the exception are now the rule.@@@These crises are putting a strain on our ability to meet the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We need a strong push to change the course of things.@@@An urgent, global rescue effort is needed.@@@We must rally and work together for the common good.@@@The only possible path for Canada and the world is through the implementation of our Sustainable Development Goals.@@@From an economic point of view, we still have a lot to do to achieve true equality between Member States.@@@We have listened carefully to what our partners and friends in the countries of the South have told us.@@@We hear their message very clearly — the international financial institutions must be reformed.@@@They must be able to adapt to today’s crises.@@@Canada has stepped up to the challenge.@@@No country should be left behind.@@@We will work hard with our partners for a fair and equitable reform of the international financial system.@@@Equity is at stake, but so are peace and world stability.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of nearly 6.5 million people around the world.@@@Canada is committed to ending the pandemic and preventing others.@@@Together, we will continue the fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.@@@Last week, Prime Minister Trudeau pledged $1.2 billion to support these efforts.@@@Let us now talk about climate change.@@@We must act with the same sense of urgency demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Science tells us that we need to do more, faster.@@@Hurricane Fiona, which hit several islands in the West Indies and eastern Canada, is just the latest example.@@@From the Arctic to small island States, climate change poses an existential threat, and we experience its effects every day.@@@Canada is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030, and then to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.@@@We have a credible plan for get there.@@@Canada will be participating in the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, and we look forward to welcoming the world to my home in Montreal for the fifteenth Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, under the chairmanship of China.@@@Our priority is to ensure the success of the Conference, where we will work together to reverse the alarming loss of animal and plant species.@@@Our own survival is at stake.@@@There are no simple solutions to the challenges we face, but it is obvious that to isolate oneself, to disregard the rule of law and to silence people is the opposite of progress.@@@And yet some countries restrict civil liberties, violate human rights and massively monitor their populations.@@@That tendency towards authoritarianism is most worrying.@@@That phenomenon is particularly visible in the region of the Xinjiang, China.@@@To that end, the publication of the United Nations report on human rights is an essential step.@@@Its findings reflect credible accounts of abuses constituting crimes against humanity.@@@Canada is concerned about the repression of human rights that we have witnessed in several countries.@@@The universality of human rights is well known.@@@These human rights are universal in nature.@@@We cannot therefore hide behind pretexts of national sovereignty in order to violate them.@@@There are limits to defending the indefensible.@@@We believe that democracy, although imperfect, remains the best system for protecting human rights and advancing sustainable development.@@@All of our democracies face challenges.@@@At home as elsewhere, we have to deal with apathy, anxiety and distrust of our institutions.@@@Canada is also committed to combating systemic racism and we continue to take concrete steps to pursue the path of reconciliation with indigenous peoples.@@@In 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau gave a speech to the Assembly and spoke of our own legacy of colonialism in Canada (see A/72/PV.12).@@@We are working tirelessly to remedy that dark chapter in our history, and we know that the full participation of indigenous peoples is fundamental to building a more just world.@@@The equality of women and girls in all their diversity is critical to peace, justice and prosperity.@@@Like many countries, Canada is proud to have a feminist foreign policy.@@@Together, we are building a global coalition in support of equality.@@@That is how we will repel the growing attacks on women’s rights and freedoms.@@@In Afghanistan, the Taliban prevents women and girls from going to school.@@@In Myanmar, courageous women who loudly demand the return of the democratic system are imprisoned by the military junta, tortured and subjected to horrific acts of sexual violence.@@@In Iran, women protesting the death of Mahsa Amini are met with arrest and bullets.@@@We salute their courage and join them in sending a strong message that women’s rights are human rights.@@@Today our Prime Minister announced that we will sanction those responsible, including Iran’s so-called morality police and its leadership.@@@From the Sudan to Haiti to Canada, women peacebuilders, human rights defenders and activists are being targeted.@@@We must continue to speak up for the rights of women and girls and to support, protect, recognize and include women peacebuilders.@@@We must also relentlessly pursue accountability for sexual violence.@@@We will continue to push for justice for Rohingya women.@@@And we will not rest until those responsible for sexual violence committed in Ukraine are held to account.@@@The Charter of the United Nations enshrines “faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women”.@@@Yet we are seeing increasing violence, the widening crackdown on rights and freedoms, and the exclusion of women and girls from the negotiating table, the boardroom and the classroom.@@@The sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls are being rolled back or denied into too many countries.@@@None of that by accident.@@@These are deliberate choices.@@@To all the women in this Hall and around the world, I say: We hear you and Canada will always stand up for your right to choose.@@@We will fight your full, equal, and meaningful participation in all walks of life.@@@We will speak up for your rights and dignity.@@@No Government, no politician, no judge and no one can take that away from you.@@@I have said that more than ever, the world needs more multilateralism; more of the United Nations, not less.@@@To that end, we must restore trust among Member States.@@@The crises we are facing have shown both the strengths and weaknesses of the structures we built nearly 80 years ago.@@@We have been able to respond to the most serious hardships with compassion and effectiveness, but we can do better.@@@Political paralysis and the abuse of the veto are undermining the Security Council.@@@We encourage efforts to reduce the power of the veto, to expand membership and to ensure that the voices of all are heard and responded to across the whole United Nations system.@@@United Nations peace operations also demand our efforts.@@@Today peacekeeping faces immense challenges.@@@Canada has long contributed to United Nations efforts to reduce conflict, and we will continue to do so.@@@Engagement with the United Nations is a core commitment of Canadians.@@@We were there at the United Nations creation, and today we are more engaged than ever.@@@We will always engage with candour and directness, because we do not equate diplomacy with deception or global politics with global platitudes.@@@The United Nations Charter begins with the words, “We the peoples of the world”.@@@We must remember that the fate of billions of people alive today and of those yet to be born is at stake in the work we do.@@@We owe them our best efforts of heart, mind and soul.@@@We can meet the test that time and circumstance have placed before us with hope, with courage and with a commitment to acting for our citizens today and for future generations to follow.@@@It is my honour to be here today, although I wish that the circumstances surrounding my first address were different.@@@A year ago, the Secretary- General presented his inspiring report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which outlines his vision for the next 25 years of global cooperation, and initiated discussions on how to reinvigorate multilateralism and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@I support the goals of the report, and yet it is a Herculean task because the world is torn apart.@@@We are witnessing the constant brutal violation of the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations on every continent.@@@The United Nations itself has become a battlefield, where some States try to convince the world that the common values to which we all are obliged to adhere do not exist.@@@The only standard that we must follow is the United Nations Charter — our unique common promise of peace for all nations, large and small, and a promise to advance fundamental human rights and the equal rights of men and women.@@@It is not a choice; it is a collective responsibility to ensure that peace, justice and human rights prevail.@@@On 24 February, the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, attacked democratic and peaceful sovereign Ukraine.@@@Russia started a war of aggression with the goal of ending the sovereignty of its neighbour, overthrowing its legitimate Government, exterminating the Ukrainian nation and implementing its abusive order, steeped in imperialism, self-interest and dominance.@@@The Russian invasion, including the illegal occupation of Crimea and Russia's prior land grabs in Georgia and Moldova, demonstrate Russia's total disrespect for international law and the rules-based international order and are an assault on the United Nations Charter and every value and principle for which the United Nations stands.@@@That brutal and unjustified aggression is the most serious threat to global peace and security since the end of the Second World War and challenges the very foundation of the United Nations system, undermining the security of all members of the international community.@@@Some colleagues are hesitant to take sides regarding the Russian aggression.@@@Some argue that the war is between Russia and Ukraine.@@@I see the aggressor and the victim.@@@Legally, as well as morally, there is only one right side to take.@@@Standing in a grey zone encourages the aggressor, undermines this Organization and fuels human suffering.@@@In recent years, we have witnessed devastating human suffering in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Yemen, Syria, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, to name just a few places.@@@Russia’s war of aggression makes finding solutions to those conflicts only more difficult, as it has increased food insecurity, adds pressure on the global humanitarian relief system and exacerbates the economic crisis.@@@I visited Ukraine two months after the invasion began.@@@The site was horrific.@@@I lack words to describe the brutality of that scene.@@@The face of war is the same everywhere.@@@Its cruelty will never leave the people who must live through it.@@@Wars and conflicts bring only horror and misery to humankind.@@@As of 22 August, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded over 13,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, with approximately 6,000 people killed and nearly 8,000 injured.@@@The actual numbers are significantly higher.@@@Each murder is further proof of the grave violations of international law by the aggressor.@@@We condemn in the strongest terms the war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.@@@The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights reported to the Security Council regarding credible allegations of forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian- occupied territory or to the Russian Federation (see S/PV.9126).@@@We saw mass graves of tortured civilians.@@@I wonder if we are living in the twenty-first century.@@@I want to pay tribute to the immeasurable resilience of the people of Ukraine.@@@We grieve for the victims of Russia’s aggression, and we stand with Ukraine in ensuring a future for its people and nation.@@@That brave nation is fighting for values set out in the United Nations Charter — the noble cause of freedom, democracy and human rights.@@@In accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, helping Ukraine to protect its right to exist is our collective obligation.@@@At the same time, it is disturbing that the Security Council, the organ that bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, has been paralysed and utterly unable to play its role.@@@Russia has abused its veto power to block the Security Council from adopting any resolutions regarding the grave violation of the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.@@@The Security Council lies at the heart of the United Nations.@@@It is shameful that, since 24 February, it has adopted only a presidential statement (S/PRST/2022/3) on Ukraine.@@@How many devastating wars will it take to move forward the long- overdue Security Council reform?@@@I am grateful that, while the Security Council remains paralysed on the issue of Russia’s aggression, the soul and the conscience of the United Nations, the General Assembly, has been active and decisive.@@@I recall the overwhelming support for resolution ES-11/1, adopted on 2 March, which condemns Russia’s aggression and urges Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its troops from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@We deplore the Russian Federation’s failure to implement that resolution, as well as its failure to comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice of 16 March, requiring Russia to immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine.@@@Estonia has always been a strong proponent of curbing the absolute veto power, and even more so when it was used to cover up war crimes and crimes against humanity.@@@I am glad that the General Assembly adopted by consensus the landmark resolution 76/262, the so- called veto initiative, which provides the General Assembly an opportunity to step in when the Security Council is unable to act.@@@The question remains: how can we accept that the aggressor has a veto power in the Security Council?
Conflicts and war bring about an enormous humanitarian crisis.@@@Russia’s aggression has led to an immense need for resources and aid.@@@Nearly 18 million Ukrainians — 40 per cent of the country’s population — are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.@@@The international support for Ukraine has been heart-warming.@@@The United Nations is busy helping Ukrainians who did not need our help before that aggression.@@@To date, Estonia has sent more than €20 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine.@@@We have seen unprecedented, massive support for Ukraine from the Estonian private sector, civil society and citizens.@@@We continue to assist, and work on, the reconstruction of Ukraine; it needs to begin now.@@@We call on others to join us in that.@@@Conflicts created the immense refugee crisis.@@@According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the total number of people worldwide who were forced to flee their homes due to conflicts and human rights violations was 89.3 million in 2021.@@@The displacements were driven, for example, by the brutality of the Bashar Al-Assad regime, conflicts in the Tigray region and the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul.@@@In 2022, that number has already exceeded the milestone of 100 million.@@@The increase is caused by Russia's war of aggression.@@@There are more than 7 million recorded Ukrainian refugees across Europe; another 7 million people were internally displaced.@@@Estonia received nearly 55,000 refugees, which is 4 per cent of our country’s population.@@@We ensure social services and basic
education for refugees fleeing from war.@@@Estonia created 1,000 additional places in various education programmes for Ukrainian refugee children by opening a new school — the Freedom School.@@@One day, its students will be the leaders and rebuilders of Ukraine.@@@Estonian education technology companies are donating their solutions to support Ukrainian schools and pupils whose education has been disrupted by war.@@@Why am I saying all this?@@@I am saying it because our future depends on young people sitting in classrooms and on their education.@@@We are made by history; we cannot let a lack of knowledge define our future.@@@To avoid such brutality repeating itself we must raise awareness of the history of our nations.@@@We need to evade confusion caused by active brainwashing and disinformation.@@@We see how ignorance makes it easy for any aggressor to put forward its false narratives.@@@War, conflict and a lack of openness bring about extreme violations of human rights.@@@It must be clear that basic human rights are universal, are the same for all United Nations Members and cannot be ignored by any Government.@@@Special attention should be devoted to ensuring gender equality and the right to education.@@@The opportunity to study should not be a wish or a dream in the twenty-first century.@@@Let me use this rostrum to praise the courageous women who are now at the forefront of the protest against the Taliban in Afghanistan to fight for their right to choose their own path and role in society.@@@It is our profound duty to support their struggle.@@@I call on the de facto leaders of Afghanistan to immediately stop harassing the Afghan female staff of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.@@@Respecting universal human rights is not a choice.@@@Neither culture nor religion can be invoked to justify human rights violations.@@@In the same vein, we welcome the release of the assessment report on the human rights situation in Xinjiang by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.@@@The report underscores the serious human rights violations occurring in Xinjiang, which may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.@@@That is extremely alarming, and it requires urgent attention by the international community.@@@There remains little dispute over the existential crisis posed by climate change.@@@We witnessed devastating flooding in Pakistan caused by erratic monsoon rains.@@@In solidarity with the people of Pakistan, Estonia is providing help to those who are severely affected.@@@Russia’s aggression also brings further pain to those already suffering from the impacts of the pandemic, conflicts, famine and climate change.@@@Let me be very clear: that aggression has brought about high inflation and global food and energy crises.@@@The head of the World Food Programme has warned that Russia’s aggression will lead to the worst food crisis since the Second World War.@@@In physics and in life, the cause triggers a reaction.@@@Russia’s aggression triggered the global food and inflation crisis.@@@We have witnessed Russia’s occupying forces stealing Ukraine’s grain supplies, burning down warehouses and destroying grain fields.@@@Market disruptions are not caused by sanctions.@@@The global food and economic crises are being caused by the war that Russia started, and Russia can end all that by ending the war.@@@Yet Russia has no intention of ending the war.@@@Instead, the Russian regime decided to escalate it.@@@We find its cynical nuclear threat totally unacceptable; it is a threat to the global community.@@@To alleviate the crisis, the European Union (EU) launched the EU-Ukraine solidarity lanes initiative, which has helped to export more than 6 million tonnes of predominantly agricultural goods from Ukraine.@@@Estonia also welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which, brokered by the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye, was signed in Istanbul on 22 July.@@@We must keep up the international pressure on Russia to monitor Russia’s adherence to the deal and its extension.@@@We are following with deep concern the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, one of the world’s largest such plants.@@@Russia has occupied the plant and turned it into a combat zone.@@@The risk of a nuclear disaster is very real.@@@The power plant should be demilitarized without delay and full control of the plant returned to Ukraine.@@@Moreover, it is essential to grant international experts ongoing and unfettered access to the facilities of the power plant.@@@I regret that last month Russia also shamelessly blocked the consensus on the outcome document of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Estonia has been vocal in addressing the issues of cybersecurity at the United Nations.@@@We continue such efforts to elevate cybersecurity as an essential component of the United Nations international peace and security agenda.@@@Russia has demonstrated how State-provided malicious cybertools are used alongside conventional weapons.@@@Russia’s cyberattack against Ukraine’s satellite communications on 23 February served to prepare and facilitate Russia’s invasion on the ground.@@@It is our duty to ensure accountability and justice at all levels.@@@Impunity breeds impunity and leads to new crimes being committed.@@@It is of the utmost importance that there be independent and effective investigations into the atrocity crimes and crimes of aggression committed against Ukraine, as well as in Syria, Ethiopia and elsewhere.@@@We must provide justice to victims and bring those responsible for atrocities and genocide to trial.@@@Estonia fully supports the investigation led by the International Criminal Court.@@@We give the most serious consideration to the establishment of an independent special court for crimes of aggression and a compensation mechanism for the damage caused by the aggression.@@@We support all initiatives that seek to ensure accountability.@@@In conclusion, the war in Ukraine affects us all.@@@It is our common duty to push back the ugly manifestations of imperialism, colonialism and racism by Russia.@@@Russia must understand that the path that it has taken is disastrous and that the war that it started cannot be won.@@@If we stop caring and if we get tired and fall into indifference, the aggressors and criminals will only be empowered.@@@That is not the world where we want to live nor the world that we want to leave to future generations.@@@The United Nations is, and remains, the cornerstone of our multilateral rules-based world order.@@@Its relevance is being put to the test; we cannot fail.@@@The United Nations must emerge from this watershed moment stronger, more united and more relevant than ever before.@@@At the outset, I wish to extend my warm congratulations and wishes for success to Mr. Csaba Korosi on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I welcome the leadership and commitment of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to peace and development, climate action, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response, as well as his sustained efforts to find solutions to the various sources of tension throughout the world.@@@In this Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, the climate emergency is creating humanitarian needs and exacerbating existing development challenges.@@@Alarming evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that we may have already reached or gone beyond major tipping points and irreversible setbacks.@@@Climate change exposes the African continent to worsening food insecurity, population displacement, recurrent droughts and pressure on water resources.@@@Faced with the urgency of this situation, I welcome the fact that, during the special high-level dialogue on the theme “The Africa We Want”, organized on 20 July 2022 under the auspices of the United Nations, the international community recognized that the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP), to be held in November in Egypt, is a unique opportunity to adjust this imbalance.@@@In that regard, I would like to express the Niger’s commitment to the proposal of the African negotiators for a new objective of $1.3 trillion in financing by 2025 to better address climate challenges.@@@In the Sahel, a geographical area to which my country, the Niger, belongs, climate change, which negatively influences agricultural and pastoral activities and water resources, is also the cause of extreme droughts, torrential rains and temperature increases above the world average.@@@That is why the Niger is paying special attention to the African Great Green Wall initiative, which is part of the African Union Agenda 2063.@@@In terms of security, the situation in the Sahel and in my country has deteriorated considerably in recent years due to a particularly negative subregional environment.@@@It all started, let us recall, with the fall in 2011 of the regime in Libya, which to this day has been unable to restore a stable power that could exercise real authority over the whole country.@@@Consequently, the vast territory of southern Libya has become a platform for transnational organized crime where the trafficking of arms, drugs, fuel and migrants prosper, perpetuating structural insecurity in all neighbouring Sahelian countries.@@@Mali, which in 2011 succumbed to the violence that originated in Libya, has never really recovered.@@@It has in turn become an incubation centre for a form of terrorism that is characteristic of a Sahel that is deeply affected by the effects of climate change preventing the practice of pastoral farming.@@@That ecosystem of violence has had a deadweight effect on the young shepherds of the communities most affected by climate change, among whom a number of terrorist vocations have arisen.@@@This scourge has spread from northern Mali to the Niger and Burkina Faso and is now attempting to spread to the countries of the Gulf of Guinea.@@@The violence has such potential to destabilize State institutions that it resulted in the downfall of the democratically elected regimes of Mali and Burkina Faso in 2020 and 2022, respectively.@@@The Niger, my country, in addition to the terrorist hotbed known as the three-borders region — Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso — is also facing another terrorist hotbed in the Lake Chad basin, where the various groups that claim to be part of the shadowy Boko Haram operate.@@@Despite the strong pressures related to the circumstances I have just described, my country is showing great resilience centred on very wise governance, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and community cohesion, as well as the rules of democracy and the rule of law.@@@It was that resolute choice of rights and freedoms that made it possible to organize transparent elections that sanctioned the first change of Head of the State by virtue of which a democratically elected President passed the baton to another democratically elected President in April 2021.@@@Need it be said that our experience proves that the surest way to ward off the effects of terrorist violence is to strengthen the democratic regime and nothing else?@@@The war against terrorism now requires us to devote significant resources to increasing the numbers of our forces, acquiring adequate equipment and building the capacities of our soldiers.@@@Allow me to take this opportunity to thank the various partners engaged with us in the fight against terrorism.@@@I would particularly like to thank France, whose action through Operation Barkhane is a major asset in the struggle against our
enemies.@@@I also thank the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany and all the other countries committed alongside us in various ways, all equally valuable.@@@That being said, I find it crucial to point out that the international community’s commitment to the fight against terrorism in the Sahel has shortcomings that need to be identified and addressed.@@@Indeed, this terrorism derives a large part of its financial resources from trans-Saharan drug trafficking towards Europe and Asia, via Libya.@@@Most of the weapons flooding the Sahel terrorist violence market also come from Libya.@@@I believe that we are faced with a problem that is not particularly complicated.@@@Why then has it not yet been possible to set up an adequate system with the necessary means to combat this phenomenon properly?@@@It is indeed time for collective reflection.@@@It is time for the great Powers present in that region and the international community as a whole to join the countries of our region in a far more relevant reflection to define an effective course of action in the fight against drug and arms trafficking in the Sahel.@@@Despite the major challenges we face, as described earlier, the Niger intends to remain a solid and stable State, backed by democratic institutions, and resolutely committed to the fight against poverty and for development.@@@Our deep conviction in that regard is that the most effective means of combating poverty consists in promoting education.@@@The development challenges for the Niger are summarized by the following simple statistics: an annual population growth rate of 3.9 per cent; an average synthetic fertility index of seven children per woman; a first birth for nearly 50 per cent of girls before the age of 15; and 50 per cent of the population aged 15 on average.@@@Those statistics say much about the state of the education system in our country, and that is why we are committed to act with determination to improve things in this area.@@@As such, the agenda based on which the people of the Niger elected us aims to take action on two fronts: improving access to and the quality of education.@@@With regard to quality, we have decided to place particular emphasis on the quality of teacher training and the professionalization of teaching.@@@With regard to improving access, our policy emphasizes the building of school infrastructure.@@@The other particularly important aspect of our educational programme that I wish to emphasize is aimed at achieving gender equity and building residential facilities for girls in rural schools.@@@Indeed, because of the precarious living conditions of children in rural schools, far from their parents, the latter tend to prevent their daughters from continuing their studies.@@@These adolescents are given in marriage as soon as they are out of the education system, which explains some of the previously mentioned statistics.@@@In offering girls the tranquility and security desired by their parents, residential facilities also offer girls conditions in which to continue their studies with the possibility of staying in school and acquiring the necessary academic and professional skills.@@@The large-scale expansion of residential facilities for girls in rural schools contributes to improved education-system performance and a reduction in the rate of population growth.@@@My reason for highlighting our ambitions in the field of education for a country like the Niger, after having spoken about climate change, terrorism and insecurity in the Sahel, is that we are aware that these three issues — demography, climate change and insecurity — are closely related.@@@Indeed, the terrorism currently at work in the Sahel is connected to the living conditions of certain communities whose environment has been considerably disrupted by climate change.@@@The Sahel is also an area that has experienced particularly high population growth in recent decades.@@@The combination of these two phenomena — demography and climate degradation — has created, as a result of the regional disorder following the fall of Colonel Al-Qaddafi’s regime in 2011, the situation of chaos that the countries of the Sahel are experiencing today.@@@That is why it is not enough for the United Nations and the international community to be moved by or to discuss terrorist violence at length.@@@We must act by investing the necessary resources in education to combat the violence of today and prevent the violence of tomorrow.@@@As the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is my honour to address this organ.@@@I congratulate Mr. Shahid on successfully presiding over the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@Despite the difficult working conditions caused by the pandemic, he worked with dedication with the Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, so that this organ of the United Nations could carry out its duties.@@@I also congratulate Mr. Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@He can count on the support and cooperation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in ensuring the productive work of this organ.@@@At the recent sessions of the General Assembly and other international forums, we regularly assessed that the global order was experiencing tectonic changes.@@@Today, however, we can conclude that the world has irreversibly changed.@@@The international relations on which the security architecture of Europe used to rest, as well as the wider international framework, now do not exist.@@@At a time when towns and villages in Ukraine are facing the terrifying reality of war, the least that we can do is not to be silent about it.@@@We must not be silent, particularly in this building, the home of the United Nations, established in order to prevent and stop what is currently happening in Ukraine.@@@We must not be silent in Bosnia and Herzegovina either.@@@We owe that to our vivid memories of the horrors of war and aggression.@@@The United Nations system was unable to prevent or stop the war in my country in the period between 1992 and 1995.@@@Unfortunately, that happened again in the case of Ukraine.@@@I am primarily referring to the Security Council, the organ responsible for safeguarding international peace and security, in the light of the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Due to internal relations and barriers, the Security Council is clearly unable to fulfil its obligations.@@@However, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on aggression against Ukraine (resolution ES-11/1) by an overwhelming majority.@@@That resolution affirmed the undisputed principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other acts of international law, which prohibit the use of armed force.@@@It orders States to resolve disagreements by peaceful means.@@@The resolution expresses support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.@@@It unequivocally refers to the actions of the Russian Federation as aggression.@@@It calls for the aggression to stop.@@@Finally, it rejects the secessionist moves of certain regions within Ukraine directed against its territorial integrity.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina supported that resolution and stood on the right side of history, along with 140 other countries.@@@That is in line with the obligations arising from the United Nations Charter, our previously held positions and our obligation, in accordance with the Stabilization and Association Agreement, to follow the foreign policy of the European Union.@@@Although the resolution does not have the power to stop the war, it has the power to stop the lies.@@@The clear and unambiguous language of this highest international forum drastically reduces the space for those who try to relativize the truth.@@@The first step towards any solution is to tell and respect the truth.@@@I hope that there will be peace as soon as possible so that people in Ukraine can live normal lives and the displaced can return to their homes
The war in Ukraine, as well as the consequences of the pandemic, led to drastic changes in all spheres of life.@@@That is currently clearly visible in the serious energy crisis, inflation, a general recession and the threat to supplies, especially in the food sector.@@@We are all facing a very difficult and challenging winter.@@@Global markets and international free trade enabled enormous progress in all corners of the world.@@@The eradication of hunger, the availability of consumer goods and the continuous economic growth in all parts of the world are all unquestionable benefits of
global economic liberalization.@@@Globalization tightly connected the various parts of the world and made us interdependent.@@@Strong economic, security and political interrelations produced an increasingly integrated global framework.@@@Within that framework, everyone relies on each another in various areas, from the economy to security.@@@At the same time, the interdependence of the different parts of the world is the source of the vulnerability of our global community.@@@That became obvious during the pandemic, when transportation and supply channels were blocked.@@@It is also obvious in the light of the current crisis related to the war in Ukraine.@@@Due to the blockade of wheat exports from Ukrainian ports, developing countries in Africa and Asia are facing hunger.@@@A large part of the European continent is facing an energy crisis due to dependence on Russian gas.@@@As a result of difficulties caused by the process of political and economic integration, in recent years we have often witnessed strong advocacy for political sovereignty and economic protectionism.@@@The consequences of the transformation of developed countries from industrial to post-industrial nations, migration and, most recently, the pandemic led many to call for the construction of economic barriers, and even actual walls and wire fences.@@@That is the wrong path to take.@@@The answer to the above problems is not to close up, but to open up.@@@The solution is not less, but more, cooperation.@@@The answer to the energy crisis in Europe, caused by dependence on a single source, is relying not only on one’s own forces.@@@The answer lies in diversification and in finding new, multiple channels of gas supply and other energy sources.@@@No one in the modern world has enough resources to be self-sustainable.@@@Past crises show that dependence on individual external sources is not sufficient either.@@@We can overcome such difficulties only by increasing our international cooperation.@@@We live in unstable times, unprecedented in recent history.@@@As we face an extremely difficult winter, we are aware of the destabilizing potential of the current economic and energy crisis.@@@The twentieth century provided extremely valuable lessons about the correlation between an economic crisis and right-wing populism.@@@The Nazi movement came to power on the wave of a great economic depression.@@@That led to the greatest cataclysm in the history of humankind.@@@Following that, the United Nations was established and the United Nations Charter, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and other United Nations acts, were adopted.@@@The fundamental idea of the United Nations is that of the equality of all people, regardless of their origin, skin colour, religion and national or other affiliation.@@@All the acts of international law I mentioned are based on that idea.@@@Modern civilization was built on that idea.@@@Today, almost eight decades later, we can hear voices openly or implicitly denying those basic tenets.@@@Right-wing populists increasingly say that all people and nations do not have equal rights and that some are more valuable than others.@@@It is becoming increasingly frequent that they openly advocate the ideas of ethnic and racial supremacy and claim that domination and brute force are the only principles on which interpersonal and international relations can, and should, be structured.@@@It takes only one step from those ideas to violence.@@@From this rostrum, from the United Nations building, I call for caution and action.@@@We will face enormous challenges in the coming period.@@@We must fulfil our duty and fight for the ideas of civilization.@@@We must defend those ideas at all costs.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina has been home to many peoples, cultures and religions for centuries.@@@Our long tradition of multiculturalism is something in which we take pride.@@@We are proud of our Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Roma and other communities, as well as the culture of living together and mutual respect that we have developed over the centuries.@@@All those communities, individually and collectively, make up the structure of the mosaic of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@That is the way things are, and that is how things will remain.@@@At the same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a meeting place of cultures, was a thorn in the side of policies based on the idea of the impossibility of living together and the necessity of confrontation.@@@Such policies led to the terrifying war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995.@@@That war culminated in the genocide in Srebrenica.@@@The resolutions from that period adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as
the reports of the Secretary-General and the judgments of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, recognize the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an international armed conflict, in which neighbouring countries participated.@@@The judgments handed down by the International Tribunal in the The Hague conclude that joint criminal enterprises took place.@@@The goal of those enterprises was the elimination of certain ethnic groups from parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina so that those territories would ultimately be annexed to neighbouring countries.@@@That was the most serious violation of international general and humanitarian law.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina has undergone an arduous peacebuilding process since the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement.@@@However, we still face numerous challenges.@@@Some of the major challenges are certain policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbourhood that have never abandoned the war-time goals of dividing our country.@@@There are parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina that are part of the broad wave of right-wing populism in Europe.@@@They openly claim that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not sustainable because, according to them, it is not possible for Muslims and Christians to live together.@@@Muslims and Christians live, and can live, together.@@@Such a way of living has a perspective.@@@What certainly has no perspective are retrograde policies that oppose that way of living
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a centuries-old history and is a living example and proof of the civilizational idea that people of different religions, nations and cultures can live together.@@@The fact is that Bosnia and Herzegovina, even despite the war aimed at its destruction, managed to survive.@@@That shows the exceptional resilience of my country.@@@The majority of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in peace with their differences.@@@There is sufficient strength for such a Bosnia and Herzegovina to persevere.@@@I am convinced that that will be the case.@@@The experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that the rule of law is a crucial factor in peacebuilding.@@@The International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, formed by the United Nations, granted the victims the minimum of justice.@@@It sent a message to criminals that their actions would not go unpunished, and that they would be brought to justice and face the consequences for their actions.@@@Moreover, there were other international community bodies that made a huge contribution to the building and safeguarding of peace, primarily the Office of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Peace Implementation Council.@@@Both those bodies were established on the basis of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, which mandates the intervention of the international community in order to maintain peace.@@@The establishment of those bodies was also upheld by the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@Consequently, the closure of those bodies is possible only following a new decision of the Security Council.@@@It is not yet time for that.@@@Allow me to remind Member States of the international supervision that was present in some significantly developed countries, such as Germany, with even greater executive powers than the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@That supervision was ended after 45 years of existence, only once the necessary prerequisites for that had been created.@@@The Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council have been helping domestic political actors to implement reforms for the past 27 years.@@@Through joint efforts, we managed to unite the three once-warring armies into a single armed force.@@@We also united the three intelligence services, tax systems, judiciaries, et cetera.@@@Thanks to those reforms and the existence of the armed forces and other State institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, even after the gradual withdrawal of 60,000 international troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peace remained intact.@@@The past year brought attacks against the 27 years of implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.@@@In particular, there was an attempt to disband State institutions established on the basis of the clear provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement.@@@Thanks to the action of the Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council, Member States, led by the United States of America, the attack on State institutions was stopped and peace was once again preserved.@@@That demonstrated
the expediency and efficiency of the international community institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@There were requests for the closure of the Office of the High Representative in the past.@@@More recently, there have been frequent requests that the High Representative take steps that would weaken the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and introduce additional ethnic divisions.@@@In accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the United Nations Charter, it is the obligation of the High Representative to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and not to contribute to its disintegration.@@@In addition to the civilian international presence in the country, there is also an international military presence in the country, specifically the European Union Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea) and the NATO headquarters, with a total of 1,100 troops.@@@In that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not special.@@@Many more developed sovereign States need the presence of international military forces in much larger numbers than is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@The international military presence was established by the Dayton Peace Agreement.@@@The Security Council reaffirms the mandate of the EUFOR-Althea mission on an annual basis.@@@The Security Council will vote on the EUFOR-Althea mandate again in less than a month.@@@It is very important for the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region that the draft resolution be adopted.@@@However, it is important to emphasize that in any case, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement, NATO has the right and obligation to deploy its forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Also, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina took decisions in the past that gave consent for the presence of EUFOR-Althea and NATO forces without any time limits.@@@Those decisions are a sufficient legal basis for the presence of an international military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes a different position.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina’s foreign policy goals are membership of the European Union (EU) and NATO.@@@The June 2022 session of the European Council opened up the space for granting Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of a candidate for membership of the European Union if certain conditions are met.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently made specific progress in terms of fulfilling the 14 priorities defined in the opinion of the European Commission on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for EU membership.@@@We have fulfilled some of the said priorities in full and some partially, including, I am pleased to say, over the past few weeks.@@@I expect that we will continue making even more progress after the general elections scheduled to be held next month on 2 October.@@@I also expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to be granted EU membership candidate status as soon as possible.@@@Regarding our relations with NATO, Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of the membership action plan.@@@In order to undertake the reforms that NATO expects from us as a potential candidate country, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted its reform programme, which is our annual obligation.@@@Regional cooperation is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s foreign policy goals.@@@We want good relations with our neighbours, based on mutual appreciation and respect under the principle of reciprocity.@@@That is the only way to build relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Everyone in our region must understand that the geostrategic and geopolitical configuration of the region is complete.@@@The path to security and prosperity is the path of mutual cooperation and solving current issues, in accordance with the principles of international law.@@@We are all equal in the region.@@@No one can dominate anyone else.@@@We all need peace and stability.@@@The whole world needs peace and stability.@@@All ongoing disputes in the world should be resolved in accordance with the principles of international law, with the involvement of the international judicial institutions.@@@That is why it is very important to strengthen multilateral mechanisms and institutions.@@@I therefore believe that the strength and authority of the United Nations as a key multilateral mechanism must be enhanced.@@@At the outset, it is my pleasure on behalf of my country’s delegation and myself to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish him every success.@@@I also express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts and invaluable work during his presidency of the General Assembly at its previous session.@@@I further commend the continuing efforts of Mr. Antonio Guterres, who leads the United Nations with wisdom and balance in times that are difficult all over the world.@@@My country, Libya, which I am honoured to serve and represent, has endured a decade of suffering and hope while building its institutions and establishing the principle of democracy.@@@The Libyan people have demonstrated to the world that they are one fabric, knit together with the same cohesion as their land and shared future.@@@In spite of all their challenges, the Libyan people have continued to work to build a united country thanks to their thoughtfulness, tolerance and patriotism.@@@They give us the determination and hope we need to continue working to realize their aspirations to build our State and pave the way for peace, stability and prosperity.@@@Current events constantly remind us of the past.@@@The Libyan Liberation Army, which was established even before the creation of the Libyan State, fought alongside the armies of the free world.@@@After the fall of Nazism and fascism, Libya earned its full independence, born of our national struggle and a regional and international agreement that paved the way for our founding fathers to build our State, unite our homeland and embark on a path to development and prosperity that made Libya an example of development in record time.@@@International policies on Libya today are still far from the reality we need.@@@The individual interests of the countries involved in Libyan affairs, combined with proxy wars and disagreements on how to resolve Libya’s situation, have not given us an opportunity to establish our own national choice.@@@Negative international interventions have led to contradictory solutions that push my country towards armed confrontations that do not spare innocent people and have resulted in intransigent political positions that do not allow for a middle ground where gaps can be bridged and national partnerships realized.@@@The Libyan Presidency Council remains committed to its role, pursuant to the Libyan Political Agreement.@@@As the supreme political authority, the Presidency Council represents the country’s unity, locally and internationally, while assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the Libyan army.@@@It is also responsible for the noble task of leading inclusive
national reconciliation efforts in order to pave the way for a democratic and peaceful transition of power through simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to thank the African Union for cooperating with us in launching the National Reconciliation Project, which is the most important pillar supporting all paths to the stability and peace we desire.@@@Those responsibilities compel us to contribute to impartial and balanced national efforts, despite attempts by certain political parties to push us towards confrontation, which we are making every effort to avoid.@@@We are trying to resolve political disputes, not participate in them.@@@In that regard, the Presidency Council has also been closely following the rounds of dialogue between Parliament and the High State Council.@@@That dialogue has yet to result in an agreement on the constitutional rules for holding the parliamentary and presidential elections.@@@The Presidency Council continues to stress that such dialogue should not continue indefinitely and is ready to intervene to break the political deadlock, if necessary.@@@With regard to the economy, the Libyan Presidency Council supports all the efforts that have made it possible to restore gas and oil production in every region of Libya.@@@That is certainly in line with national interests and helps to maintain stability in international markets, which have been under severe pressure, especially in countries that are major energy consumers.@@@Furthermore, based on its balanced national position, the Libyan Presidency Council is committed to the transparent and fair management of oil revenues, which are a wealth that belongs to all Libyans.@@@The goal is to ensure that public funds are not a cause for political conflict and are used to benefit all Libyans throughout the country without discrimination on political or geographic grounds.@@@If we manage to achieve that goal, it will reduce the current conflict for power and create a more stable environment conducive to the democratic transition we desire.@@@My country takes a positive view of the role of the United Nations in Libya in spite of the recent slow pace of intervention, and we continue to expect it to play an active role through the new leadership of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya.@@@We call on the United Nations to embark on serious efforts in support of inclusive national solutions that can help break the political deadlock.@@@The current impasse has paved the way for individual ventures and initiatives that risk undermining all the political gains that have been made thanks to the Libyan dialogue held under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@I also call for restoring momentum to our economic process.@@@It is one of the three tracks of the Berlin Conference on Libya, which neglected issues related to transparency and justice in the management of oil resources, public expenditure and addressing corruption.@@@While we may have thought that the errors of the past would never be repeated, today’s world is on the threshold of a new international order that brings reminders of the suffering that humankind endured in the early twentieth century.@@@It is high time for human conscience to speak out in favour of peace and for the entire world to support the international principles adopted by the United Nations in order to uphold the principles of maintaining the sovereignty of States, resolving conflict by peaceful means, respecting good-neighbourly relations and refraining from destabilizing the security of nations.@@@I also call for respect for the right of people to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in line with the criteria defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency.@@@Furthermore, my country is on the front lines in the fight against terrorism.@@@I call for renewed unity in combating terrorism, as it remains a threat to every country and spares no race, religion or civilization.@@@My country has taken on all of its responsibilities at the international level to stop the financing and spreading of terrorism.@@@I reiterate from this rostrum my country’s permanent commitment to supporting the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own State, ending Israel’s settlement-building and acts of aggression and upholding the international resolutions on the issue.@@@This month the Libyan people observed a minute of silence to mark Martyrs’ Day.@@@It is also a tribute to the martyrdom of our national hero, Omar Al-Mukhtar, who resisted the colonizers.@@@The Libyan people are inspired by the combat of its ancestors to learn patience and to be more determined in defending their rights.@@@The Libyan people draw inspiration from their founding fathers to become more tolerant.@@@The current period will be enshrined in the national memory.@@@Future generations will recognize those who supported us and those who undermined our security and plundered our wealth.@@@Owing to its position in Africa with Arab neighbours, Libya is a link between civilizations and an economic hub where the interests of the world are concentrated.@@@The damage that we have experienced has affected not only the Libyan people, but also the region and our international relations.@@@At the outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi and his friendly country Hungary on presiding over the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, and offer him Tunisia’s support for the guidelines he has outlined.@@@“Solidarity, sustainability and science” are indeed basic components of the solutions we are looking for.@@@I also extend deep appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his capable management of the work of the previous session of the General Assembly, against the backdrop of grave challenges whose repercussions are still being felt and unfortunately foretell further difficulties.@@@Thanks are due to Mr. Antonio Guterres for his ongoing efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization and to ensure an effective response to our challenges and to contain their impacts, especially through the implementation of Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@That Agenda, with all its contents, provides a ray of hope for the international community at a time of concerns about our capacity to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic at the health, economic and humanitarian levels.@@@We have found in the Agenda and in other United Nations references that we have supported and engaged in — such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — a path towards common solutions within a framework of solidarity and parity so that no one is left behind.@@@Unfortunately, however, many peoples today are threatened to be left behind as a result of international financial structural imbalances and limited international solidarity amid exacerbated risks and threats of disputes, conflicts, political crises and unprecedented natural disasters due to climate change, in addition to the terrible flows of irregular migration and the increase in the number of refugees, not to mention the millions of people threatened by famine, malnutrition and extreme poverty.@@@At a time when we were trying to overcome the repercussions of COVID-19 and its devastating effects, which will be felt for many years to come, the Russian- Ukrainian crisis has returned us to a state of uncertainty.@@@Indeed, the world today is facing a severe food and energy crisis as a result of the disruption of production and supply chains, shortages of basic materials, unprecedented high food prices, the deterioration of purchasing power, and high rates of inflation, debt and debt servicing.@@@Today we are indeed facing a defining moment in our history and common destiny that calls on all of us to find radical and transformative solutions that will allow our peoples to overcome the current circumstances, enhance our resilience and build the sustainability we hope for.@@@Our peoples are watching us at this session and wondering whether the international community is truly capable of implementing transformative solutions and whether we have the political will to address the global crises that are escalating and accumulating.@@@At each session, new issues are added to the old ones, so are we simply postponing today’s solutions until they become tomorrow’s problems?@@@Are we assuming our responsibility for the future of coming generations?@@@Today’s solutions must protect us from tomorrow’s crises, and those solutions cannot be formulated within traditional policies and approaches.@@@In this context, Tunisia stresses once again that circumstantial solutions to certain issues do not fundamentally resolve them, but are merely palliatives.@@@Over the decades, such remedies have proven unable to provide radical and effective solutions to various crises.@@@We need new policies based on solidarity and justice, such as those contained in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda.@@@The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of the situation in Ukraine have revealed the need to review those approaches so that we can save the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals before it is too late, as indicated by the Secretary-General.@@@In that context, I would like to emphasize the following.@@@First, solutions cannot be formulated outside the framework of multilateral action and human solidarity, and in cooperation and coordination with the United Nations, while preserving the other frameworks and mechanisms as tributaries for that cooperation.@@@They complement and complete such coordination, without competing with it or weakening its ability to provide solutions.@@@That is what Tunisia emphasized recently on the occasion of our country’s hosting, on 27 and 28 August, the eighth Tokyo International Symposium on Development in Africa, where we discussed many items on our agenda, including how to achieve sustainable development through approaches in which economic, security and humanitarian dimensions are integrated.@@@Secondly, we need to adopt an economic approach that focuses on the quality of economic growth and not its speed, especially by investing more in knowledge, science, innovation and modern technologies.@@@In Tunisia, we look forward to the Francophonie Summit, which will be hosted on the island of Djerba on 19 and 20 November, under the theme “Connectivity in diversity: Digital as a vector of development and solidarity in the Francophonie space”.@@@The recommendations of the Summit should promote ways to achieve our common goals in the digital, technological and development fields.@@@Thirdly, we must take a qualitative leap in debt management through new development approaches and in how the global financial system can provide financial support without unfair conditions or dicta that do not take into account the specificities and circumstances of developing and least developed countries, especially in the African region, where the global financial system has not offered the support they expected in their efforts to overcome the existing challenges and in their quest for recovery and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@That was confirmed by the Secretary-General recently when he spoke of a disruptive global financial system that disappoints developing countries.@@@In that context, Tunisia calls for a restructuring of debt into investment projects to generate wealth.@@@It also stresses the importance of enabling peoples to recover their looted funds that were smuggled abroad.@@@Fourthly, the international community must today renew its commitment to the African continent on the basis of solidarity, equality and equal partnership, while listening to its development and security concerns.@@@Fifthly, the challenges facing the world today cannot be addressed without consolidating the elements of international peace and security, based on the rule of international law and international legitimacy.@@@In that context, it is necessary to work on settling conflicts peacefully without selectivity, putting an end to absurd conflicts, refraining from fabricating crises and finding solutions to just causes, foremost of which is the Palestinian question, which requires an end of the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital.@@@Sixthly, we must realize that every country, without exception, has its own challenges, problems and peculiarities.@@@There is no one-size-fits-all mode or model.@@@Let us agree that there are principles, values and common denominators that unite us and that we are all obligated to respect, but the details of choices and directions remain within the sovereign purviews of States.@@@There is no democracy, but there are democracies.@@@Democracy in Tunisia represents an unshakable national option, which we are working to strengthen and preserve through a corrective path whose phases will be completed by the legislative elections of 17 December.@@@Tunisia’s democratic choice arises from the will of the Tunisian people, who are determined to make their democratic experience a success and complete their political path under the auspices of a State that preserves their constitutional rights, freedoms, security and dignity, in which the law is supreme and the people are sovereign.@@@Tunisia has demonstrated in various regional and international forums its adherence to human rights and freedoms with further support and development.@@@It has contributed to enriching the United Nations system in that regard with several initiatives and contributions that are recognized for their credibility and sustained, firm alignment with common universal principles.@@@The stakes before us today can be addressed only with a true common resolve to go beyond the diagnosis stage to the action and response stage through the optimal utilization of our capabilities and capabilities and by activating multilateral action.@@@Our peoples are tired of unfulfilled promises, so let us all rise to that defining moment and rebuild trust in our national and international institutions so as to move towards achieving our common goals of building a better world for us and for future generations, a world that is worthy of human beings wherever they are, while preserving their security and dignity and realizing their well-being and sustainability.@@@I take this rostrum with a heavy heart, more pessimistic than I was last year and more cynical and disappointed.@@@We have come to depend on the multilateral system that has the Charter of the United Nations at its centre.@@@Where is the collective will to adequately address the challenges of our time?@@@Where is our shared conviction to work together for the betterment of humankind?@@@Where is the hope?@@@Today there are conflicts on several continents; geopolitical tensions are heightened.@@@The unjustified, unprovoked and illegal attack on Ukraine by the Russian Federation has shaken the foundations of the multilateral system.@@@That is wrong.@@@The consequential crises that we face are not confined to the battlefield in Europe; they are global and affect us all.@@@Democratic norms and human rights, even where thought to be firmly rooted, are being rolled back.@@@Poverty is on the increase.@@@The planet is being destroyed by climate change.@@@International cooperation and solidarity have been supplanted by nationalism and unilateralism.@@@Global market prices for food and petroleum remain volatile, having reached historic highs earlier this year.@@@The lingering impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and persistent supply-chain disruptions have contributed to skyrocketing inflation.@@@Those economic realities exacerbate an already acute social situation in Belize.@@@Poverty is estimated to have risen by 10 per cent between 2018 and 2021.@@@A total of 45.5 per cent of Belizeans are estimated to be moderately to severely food insecure.@@@Homicides are again on the rise.@@@The post-pandemic recovery that we anticipated is delayed, and the chorus of promises and commitments to pivoting towards building back better and to getting the recovery right have yielded little.@@@Instead, global action and inaction have resulted only in deepening the many crises that we are facing.@@@Global temperatures have already increased by 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels.@@@Greenhouse gas emissions reached record highs in 2021 and continue to rise this year.@@@Fossil fuels are still dominant, while renewables account for an abysmal 15 per cent of global energy sources.@@@The current energy crisis in Europe has led to people using more fossil fuels as a panacea rather than doubling down on the energy transition.@@@Biodiversity is declining at a faster rate than ever before, with profound and unknown consequences for our environment, health, productivity and well-being.@@@Those realities heighten climate risk, especially for vulnerable States.@@@Belize ranks eighth of 183 on the Global Climate Risk Index.@@@We are but one hurricane away from catastrophe, yet financing needed for climate adaptation remains woefully inadequate; only about a quarter of all climate finance goes to adaptation.@@@Global debt is at crisis levels.@@@The Secretary- General’s latest report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) paints a dismal and disturbing picture of the state of play of the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The SDGs are at real risk of not being achieved.@@@Our current systems and institutions, conceived for Second World War recovery, are straining under the weight of today’s crises.@@@In truth, they are broken and stand impotent in the face of the three Cs: COVID-19, climate and conflict.@@@And, yes, our people and our planet are paying the price.@@@How do we fix that?@@@We need a full-scale, bold reimagining of the global financial architecture, and no more tinkering at the edges to conceive additional programmes that are based on the same false logic — it simply does not work.@@@Public-sector expenditure on climate-caused loss and damage cannot continue to be classified according to fiscal orthodoxy.@@@The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely devoid of ways to quantify consequential climate impacts on public debt and countries’ capacity
to pay.@@@The obstinate focus of international financial institutions on primary balances and debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios ignores the empirical evidence that nature is in revolt.@@@Incredibly, a recent analysis revealed that of the 80 IMF-funded country programmes around the world, climate was central to the country assessment in only a single case — that of Samoa.@@@We need a new global financial architecture that has the willingness and capacity to identify systemic threats, such as debt and climate risk, and devise tools that are commensurate to the challenges.@@@We urgently need a new global financial architecture dedicated to achieving the SDGs and net-zero emissions and to building resilience.@@@We need a new global financial architecture that incorporates an effective global financial safety net with the capacity to respond to today’s multiple, simultaneous and escalating crises.@@@We need a global financial architecture for today’s challenges that is responsive to the current needs of States, especially the vulnerable countries, many of which were not Member States in the 1940s.@@@Belize has, within its limited fiscal space, tried to stimulate an economic recovery while staying true to its social values.@@@The Belizean economy grew by 5.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, the highest level of production for any first quarter on record.@@@Through an innovative debt-for-nature swap, Belize reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio from 133 per cent to 108 per cent last year, resulting in more than $250 million in debt- service savings.@@@My Government has instituted an amnesty programme to enable up to 40,000 qualifying persons to be regularized.@@@We anticipate that by the end of the amnesty we will have regularized more migrants per capita than any other country.@@@But forces at the global level are determined to diminish our aspiration to an economic rebound and underwrite our social and human development and resilience.@@@Three critical issues must be addressed by a new global financial architecture in order to achieve transformative and systemic solutions.@@@The financing needs of developing countries have increased significantly since we adopted the 2030 Agenda.@@@The international financial institutions and multilateral development banks have failed to meet the needs of developing countries.@@@The figures do not lie.@@@The truth is that the financing needs of developing countries amount to $4.3 trillion — more than quadruple the lending capacity of the IMF and well above the lending trends of the World Bank, which loaned only $99 billion last year.@@@The availability of affordable, long-term and dependable sources of financing is indispensable to the achievement of the SDGs and climate resilience.@@@We need international financial institutions that will urgently align their policies and practices with the achievement of the SDGs and climate goals and redistribute liquidity to developing countries.@@@We need a long-overdue expansion in quota allocations to expand the resources of the IMF.@@@We need the multilateral development banks and regional banks to provide considerably more longer-term financing, de-risk investment, support the development of capital markets and integrate sustainability objectives to enable the use of innovative instruments.@@@Financing must be accessible and affordable to vulnerable countries.@@@Amazingly, in the past seven years financial flows to small island developing States (SIDS) have declined.@@@Net official development assistance declined from $6.2 billion in 2016 to $4.1 billion in 2018.@@@The paradox is that the countries most vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, and with the least fiscal capacity to adapt and recover, do not qualify for grant and concessionary financing.@@@And the fact that since 2008 the Group of 20 (G-20) nations have printed $25 trillion in stimulus money magnifies that paradox.@@@We therefore call on international financial institutions, multilateral development banks and development partners to use the multidimensional vulnerability index after its finalization later this year.@@@That will unlock financing for vulnerable countries, supporting their efforts to achieve the SDGs, adapt to climate change and build resilience.@@@Public debt is at unprecedented levels globally.@@@It has surpassed the 2008 financial crisis levels.@@@Commercial banks and private investors hold about $54 trillion in the global sovereign debts of emerging markets.@@@That debt deluge is attributable to the inaccessibility of concessional financing, the impact of the pandemic, the costs of climate change and disaster recovery, other external shocks and, for SIDS, structural features related to their small size.@@@The current tentative, reactionary and piecemeal approach to addressing the debt problem has proven hopelessly ineffective.@@@We must break the pernicious cycle between debt and climate and disaster risk.@@@The international financial institutions must incorporate climate risk into debt sustainability tools.@@@We need a two-pronged response.@@@First, debt relief is needed for all vulnerable countries.@@@Secondly, we need to rapidly mainstream innovative policies that tackle debt repayment capacity and avoid excessive indebtedness.@@@In the current circumstances, there is a compelling need for urgency to advance a multilateral sovereign debt restructuring mechanism.@@@History — a cruel history — is repeating itself.@@@For centuries, colonialism transported trillions in plundered wealth to the oppressors.@@@Reparations are overdue.@@@I now ask how much longer the new climate colonialism will continue punishing the victims and sparing the victimizers?@@@Speaking of injustices, it is shameful that a unilateral, illegal and immoral commercial and financial embargo continues to be imposed on Cuba, in defiance of the international community and United Nations resolutions.@@@The cruel sanctions visited on the Cuban people were not eased as they suffered the wrath of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Even now, as the effects of the fires in Matanzas cause hardship, there appears to be no possibility of an easing.@@@Belize repeats its call for the immediate lifting of the embargo and salutes the resilience and fortitude of the Cuban people.@@@We stand with them.@@@Belize continues to be gravely concerned about the spiralling deterioration of the situation in Haiti.@@@We call on the international community to advance a robust and comprehensive programme of support for the Haitian people.@@@Taiwan, an exemplary nation in many respects, continues to be excluded from the international community, unable to participate and contribute to functional multilateral cooperation.@@@The challenges confronting humankind today require the full participation of all countries and peoples in the struggle for development and prosperity.@@@The outdated policy imposed on Taiwan to promote its exclusion must yield to the greater good.@@@Belize calls for Taiwan to take its rightful place among the international community of nations.@@@I also reiterate Belize’s full support for the realization of an independent Palestinian State, within its 1967 borders, with all attendant rights, including the recognition of East Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return.@@@The people of Palestine continue to suffer the indignities of illegal occupation and apartheid.@@@It is a disturbing prospect that the world’s sacred promise to deliver a two-State solution is slipping from their grasp.@@@Justice is the cornerstone of peace.@@@In that spirit, Belize and Guatemala have been pursuing the peaceful, just and final resolution of Guatemala’s claim to Belizean territory before the International Court of Justice.@@@We continue to count on the support of the international community as the judicial process proceeds and, when it concludes, for the demarcation exercise to be carried out.@@@In the meantime, we must redouble our efforts to manage the daily challenges that arise along the border areas, in accordance with the 2005 confidence-building measures.@@@Additionally, now more than ever we need to conclude a Sarstoon protocol, a cooperation mechanism that would help to prevent unnecessary incidents in that area.@@@We had great expectations for the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow.@@@COP26 was considered a make-or- break moment for the world’s leaders to make more ambitious pledges to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C within reach.@@@We were wrong.@@@Rather than getting global commitments to keep the 1.5°C goal alive, we left Glasgow with commitments that will see the global temperature increase by 2.7°C by 2100.@@@That is utterly unacceptable and morally unjust.@@@Our people will continue to suffer for something that we did not cause.@@@Rather than meeting the commitments to delivering $100 billion annually, we left Glasgow with a finance road map — yet another paper promise.@@@Rather than delivering a loss and damage facility to help our countries deal with the losses and damages caused by climate change, we left with mas palabras.@@@In the meantime, Belize continues to suffer from climate-related damages equivalent to 4 per cent of its GDP annually — among the highest in the world.@@@Let us try this again.@@@We need less talk and more decisions at the next two climate-related conferences.@@@The fifteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to be held in Montreal, must agree an ambitious and effective post- 2020 global biodiversity framework to take into account
the economic costs of biodiversity loss and provide financial support for developing countries’ efforts to deter it.@@@At COP27 in Egypt, the G-20 must bring new commitments to closing the emissions gap, bring the financing for adaptation and establish a financing facility to substantively address loss and damage.@@@We are extremely concerned that those expectations may be jeopardized by G-20 dynamics, but we cannot allow backsliding — achieving anything less will be a failure.@@@For Belize and SIDS, failure is not an option.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic and the climate emergency are the most catastrophic events since the Second World War.@@@Then as now, a new vision, frameworks and instruments are required to achieve the sustainable and inclusive future that our people and future generations deserve.@@@The near-term global economic outlook compels us to act with urgency to avert even worse humanitarian and development outcomes and to restore stability to the international system.@@@Our failure to act decisively and urgently on COVID-19, conflict and climate condemns humankind and our planet irreversibly to disaster.@@@History will not absolve us if we fail.@@@Our collective destiny and future inspire us to action.@@@The aspirations of our people must be fulfilled.@@@We know what to do.@@@We have the resources to meet the needs of humankind.@@@We must find the political will to act.@@@We must act now to avert disaster and fulfil the promise of tomorrow.@@@We ask for the guidance of our Creator in order to ensure that our work is not in vain.@@@When we met in this Hall last year, I was cautiously optimistic that the world would slowly but surely find its footing after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@My call then was to look forward and focus on strengthening our resilience and preserving our hard-earned development goals (see A/76/PV.11).@@@Little did we know then that only one year later we would find ourselves in a very different world, facing another crisis with tremendous global consequences that reach beyond the pandemic.@@@On 24 February, war returned to Europe when Russia brutally attacked Ukraine, an independent and sovereign country.@@@Russia is trying to redraw borders using tanks and rockets — something that the world has not seen since Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait.@@@It is using explicit nuclear blackmail and fake referendums in clear violation of international law.@@@Its war of aggression against Ukraine has destroyed many illusions — the illusion that the security architecture that we created after the fall of the Iron Curtain would continue to pay a peace dividend, guaranteeing stability and security; that the European peace project would prevent war on our continent; and that crises and tensions can and would ultimately be solved by peaceful means, through dialogue and diplomacy.@@@Russia’s attack was like a geopolitical ice bucket thrown at our face, brutally tearing us from our daydreams of a post-historical and post-national Europe.@@@Deep within us, we clung to the belief that Francis Fukuyama might still be right with his The End of History, at least as far as Europe was concerned.@@@And we trusted that we had learned our lessons after the two horrific World Wars, half a century of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain dividing our continent.@@@Looking back, we have to admit that we were perhaps delusional, naive and, yes, maybe even foolish.@@@Indeed, our holiday from history is over.@@@Many in this Hall might now think: Why do Europeans make such noise and a fuss over it?@@@They might point to the fact that war and military conflict are an everyday reality in many parts of the planet.@@@They might even accuse us of applying double standards and contend that we only react so strongly to Russia’s invasion because of geographic and cultural proximity, or because the Ukrainians look like us.@@@I firmly reject such a narrative.@@@Let me be very clear: this is a war in Europe, but it is not a European war.@@@In fact, it is an assault against the rules-based international order, which we all established together over the past decades.@@@It is a flagrant and deliberate breach of the founding Charter of this very Organization — our United Nations.@@@In the Charter, every single State in this Hall has committed to settle international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the threat of use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.@@@What is worse is that this breach has been committed not by any State, but by a permanent member of the Security Council — the very organ responsible for upholding the Charter and ensuring international peace and security.@@@That puts into question the very foundations of our security and stability.@@@All of a sudden, we find ourselves in a world in which the rule of law risks being replaced by the law of the jungle.@@@Honestly, such a world poses a fundamental threat to us all, especially to smaller countries, such as Austria — countries that rely on international law as their shield and their protective cloak against unilateralism and the use of force.@@@I firmly believe that the ideas and principles laid down in the Charter are as valid today as they were 77 years ago, when, in 1945,
in his address to the San Francisco Conference, former United States President Harry Truman said,
“We can no longer permit any nation, or group of nations, to attempt to settle their arguments with bombs and bayonets.@@@If we continue to abide by such decisions, we will be forced to accept the fundamental concept of our enemies, namely, that, ‘Might makes right’”.@@@Those words have not lost their truth or validity.@@@Are we really incapable of learning from history?@@@We are once again facing a country that is attempting to settle its neo-imperialistic score by using bombs and bayonets, targeting civilians and committing atrocities that may amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law.@@@And those bombs and bayonets are not only targeting Ukrainians.@@@They are also targeting the world’s most vulnerable countries, pushing them into a triple crisis of food, energy and financing shortages.@@@Let me be very clear here: We should not confuse cause and effect.@@@We have to place responsibility firmly where it belongs.@@@Some try to spread the narrative that the triple crisis of food, energy and financing is somehow connected to the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the Russian Federation.@@@That is simply wrong.@@@To put it very clearly, there are no sanctions whatsoever on the exports of grain, oilseeds, other foodstuffs, fertilizers or gas to third countries.@@@Instead, it is actually the Russian Federation that is cynically using food and energy as a weapon, pushing millions of vulnerable people around the world into poverty, hunger and debt.@@@According to the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, the triple crisis involving the latter is now affecting 1.7 billion people around the planet.@@@Not even the Soviet Union went that far.@@@We are living in an era of transformation, with the COVID-19 pandemic, global food and energy shortages, the soaring rise in the cost of living, rapid technological change, climate change and the prospect of a very bumpy road ahead of us as far as the world economy is concerned.@@@Those are indeed scary perspectives.@@@It is no wonder that our citizens feel anxious and insecure.@@@A storm is brewing that will seriously affect millions of people, especially the most vulnerable.@@@That is a recipe for disaster, potentially leading to mass migration and social and political tensions.@@@We rapidly have to take countermeasures, not only nationally but in global solidarity.@@@This year, Austria is spending more on development assistance and humanitarian aid than ever before, and next year we will increase our respective budgets even more.@@@But we all know in this Hall that no Government alone can shoulder those challenges.@@@We desperately need a functioning multilateral system.@@@We need a rules- based international order with the United Nations at its core.@@@Our security depends on States respecting one another’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@Our political stability rests on the principle of pacta sunt servanda.@@@And our economic prosperity requires functioning export markets and secure supply lines.@@@The war in Ukraine is not a conflict of East versus West or North versus South.@@@The dividing line runs clearly between the rule of law and the law of the jungle.@@@International law is valid for everyone, no matter the geographical, religious or ethnic context.@@@There is no such thing as first-class or second-class international law.@@@Civilians need to be protected, whether in Mariupol or in the villages of Yemen.@@@Fundamental freedoms and human rights, especially the rights of women and girls, must be respected, whether in Crimea or in Kabul.@@@Using hunger as a weapon is simply unacceptable, whether by blocking shipments out of Odesa or by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the province of Tigray.@@@There needs to be accountability for war crimes, whether they happen in Bucha or Aleppo.@@@I am proud that Vienna is host to the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine.@@@We, the Austrians, will continue to actively support the efforts by the International Criminal Court to shed light on the savage acts committed in Ukraine.@@@Effective multilateralism and respect for the rule of law have been at the core of Austria’s foreign policy for decades, as symbolized by the United Nations Headquarters in Vienna and our willingness to take on even more responsibility as a candidate in the 2026 elections for a non-permanent member seat on the Security Council.@@@We count on State Members’ support.@@@Constructive dialogue and pragmatic diplomacy will continue to be our guide.@@@It is what Austria as an open and democratic society simply stands for.@@@I truly believe that we are facing the most challenging time of our political generation.@@@Our actions today will shape the future of our international system, which rose out of the ashes of the two horrible World Wars and the end of the Cold War.@@@I am not saying that the system is perfect — far from it — but at least it is a system in which we are striving to create a world where the rights of all people and the sovereignty of every nation are
respected and peace, sustainability and social justice are possible.@@@Obviously, these times are heydays for doomsayers.@@@Yet I remain confident that we can and will prevail.@@@Why, one might ask?@@@It is because I deeply believe that our societies based on freedom, pluralism and individual rights are remarkably resilient and have proven so during the pandemic — not despite, but because of our vibrant political debates, opposing opinions, critical media and civil society.@@@They are the key reasons and ingredients that we continue to innovate, adapt and learn from our mistakes to rise in the face of adversity.@@@I want my children and grandchildren to be able to grow up in a world where rules are applied and respected; where they can live their lives in freedom and without fear; and where might does not make right.@@@Yesterday’s speech by President Vladimir Putin of Russia made it obvious that this conflict will not be over very soon.@@@But let us not give in to fear, self-doubt or defeatism.@@@Let us be steadfast.@@@Let us stand ready to defend our values — the values of the United Nations.@@@At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@At the same time, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts in leading the work of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, during a very tumultuous time.@@@Our theme of this session, entitled “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is indeed relevant to the current context.@@@Global uncertainties have been exacerbated by the escalation of armed conflicts, the arms race, the rise in small-scale security alliances, the technology and trade wars, the imposition of economic sanctions and the mounting threats to multilateralism.@@@In fact, the war in Ukraine has not just complicated international relations in Europe but caused serious economic disruptions and exacerbated our food and energy security.@@@The escalation of hostilities involving more and more actors, directly or indirectly and with no end in sight, coupled with the threat of nuclear war, has had serious impacts on the world at large.@@@The situation in the Korean peninsula remains alarming due to the preparations for a seventh nuclear test.@@@This year, North Korea has launched dozens of ballistic missiles in response to military drills.@@@In addition, the tension between the United States and China over the Taiwan issue is also of concern.@@@Overall, in this very challenging environment and as a country that has achieved a hard-earned peace in our own history, Cambodia is making great efforts to engage constructively with the United Nations in upholding international peace and security and promoting respect for the fundamental principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@The present gathering reflects the remarkable success of our collective efforts to overcome the unprecedented pandemic, yet the battle against that global health crisis is not over yet.@@@New variants and other infectious diseases are emerging; what else could emerge in the future?@@@A strong global health system, particularly the World Health Organization with its central coordination role, could help to build resilient and sustainable national health systems.@@@Open and transparent multilateral engagement in the distribution of vaccines, driven by a true principle of shared responsibility, is the only way to prepare for and prevent future pandemics, coupled with the sharing of lessons learned and best practices, the transfer of technologies in vaccine research and development.@@@Moreover, another existential threat facing humankind is our vulnerability to climate change.@@@We need to transform the process of addressing climate change issues today, not tomorrow.@@@It has been 50 years since Governments were warned about the need to change our production and consumption patterns to avoid disaster.@@@Sadly, ever since, we have only seen more loss of biodiversity, more land degradation and a growing scarcity of fresh water.@@@Our collective action must focus on global mitigation efforts to promote climate-resilient development.@@@Our commitment to lowering the mean global temperature by 1.5° C requires dedicated climate financing and technology transfer to facilitate meaningful transition in mitigation and adaptation
efforts.@@@The Glasgow outcomes adopted at the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be implemented with great urgency, bearing in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.@@@Moreover, the threat of the trade and economic decoupling arising from the United States-China rivalry will certainly dampen the prospects for global growth.@@@Therefore, the fundamental transformative solution of the social, economic and political process is to strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its heart, that can promote open international trade, reduce trade barriers and ensure the resilience of regional and global value chains.@@@Meanwhile, we need to pay greater attention to inclusive digital policies and regulatory frameworks conducive to greater investment in digital infrastructure, which is so essential to bridging the growing digital divides and generating new sources of growth.@@@Enhancing green economic development is also an indispensable part of nurturing sustainable socioeconomic development through the expansion of cooperation in building green infrastructure, promoting energy transition and leveraging green technology.@@@This year, Cambodia is honoured to hold the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is now 55-year-old.@@@We are proud to celebrate our historic milestone and the remarkable achievements we have made along the way.@@@Throughout the years, ASEAN has been able to navigate the constantly changing geopolitical landscape to emerge as one of the most prominent and successful regional organizations, while making great strides in advancing its credibility and relevance in world affairs.@@@Our theme, “ASEAN A.C.T.:	Addressing
Challenges Together,” highlighting a strong spirit of togetherness, encompasses all the key pressing issues I mentioned earlier.@@@Of course, these challenges have far-reaching implications for the ASEAN community building process and our external relations.@@@But as Chair of ASEAN, Cambodia is as committed as ever to consolidating our efforts to address our shared goals of bringing benefits to our peoples based on the spirit of ASEAN centrality, unity and solidarity.@@@ASEAN has been successful in coordinating towards accepting Timor-Leste as the eleventh member of the Association.@@@Earlier in this meeting, the President of Timor-Leste expressed his country’s sincere aspiration to ASEAN membership, and I hope that later this year or early in the next Timor-Leste will become the eleventh member of ASEAN, which represents more than 600 million people.@@@I thank the President of Timor- Leste for attending my statement here in the General Assembly Hall and hope that his country will indeed join our community.@@@The situation in Myanmar is worrisome, with its direct implications for the security and stability of the whole region, but we must recognize that the crisis is complex and deep-rooted.@@@As ASEAN Chair, Cambodia is fully committed to helping Myanmar resolve the crisis and all our efforts are aimed at seeking a cessation of violence, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need, and the ongoing building of trust among all parties concerned to enable an inclusive political dialogue, as mandated by the ASEAN five-point consensus.@@@Over the past two years, the Royal Government of Cambodia has made strenuous proactive efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through the introduction of health measures, social and economic interventions and administrative measures.@@@The Royal Government has set COVID-19 vaccination as a key strategic measure.@@@As a result, Cambodia now has one of the highest coverage rates of vaccinated population in the world; in particular, we have achieved strong herd immunity, enabled the country to fully reopen in late 2021, and resumed all socioeconomic activities in the new normal.@@@I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all friendly countries that have provided vaccines to Cambodia through bilateral and multilateral frameworks.@@@In the social sector, the Royal Government has worked with development partners, including United Nations agencies, to launch and scale up a number of important programmes, such as a cash- for-work programme, aimed at improving community infrastructure and providing additional employment opportunities, and a cash transfer programme for poor and vulnerable households to help alleviate hardship and maintain the livelihood of the poor.@@@In the economic sector, the Royal Government has made unremitting efforts to address chronic structural problems, boost competitiveness and promote economic diversification.@@@In fact, the Royal Government has
addressed major challenges faced by businesses through the implementation of the New Investment Law, the Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021-2035, the Strategic Framework and Programmes for Economic Recovery in the Context of Living with COVID-19 in a New Normal 2021-2023, the Law on Public-Private Partnership and the adoption of free trade agreements, such as the Cambodia- China Free Trade Agreement, the Cambodia-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.@@@Overall, the Cambodian economy is estimated to achieve a growth rate of 5.4 per cent by 2022, supported by a strong recovery in manufacturing, tourism and agriculture.@@@With respect to the democratization process, the recent communal election held in June reflected our continued efforts as more than 80 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots in a free, fair, peaceful and transparent manner.@@@The appreciation and full support of the Cambodian people for the unremitting efforts of the Royal Government of Cambodia in preserving peace, political stability and socioeconomic development and in the successful fight against the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an overwhelming majority vote in favour of the ruling party.@@@Furthermore, with regard to peacekeeping missions, Cambodia has continued deploying thousands of its peacekeeping forces to missions in countries in crisis.@@@More than 15 per cent of Cambodian peacekeepers serving in United Nations missions are women.@@@They are role models, inspiring women and girls in societies that are often male-dominated to exercise their rights and participate in the peace process.@@@On cooperation with the United Nations, I wish to note that just yesterday, the Supreme Court Chamber of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia issued a judgment upholding the life sentence of former Khmer Rouge Head of State for genocide, crimes against humanity and grave violations of the Geneva Conventions.@@@That historical moment highlighted the outstanding cooperation between Cambodia and the United Nations, through the hybrid court, in bringing justice to the people of Cambodia, who suffered the heinous crime of auto-genocide.@@@We can tell the world that the truth that has been revealed and justice served, and broadcast far and wide that this crime must never happen again in human history.@@@I take this moment to express appreciation to all donors for providing a supporting budget and to our Cambodian compatriots for their cooperation in consolidating the national reconciliation process.@@@In conclusion, despite many challenges impacting our political, social, and economic progress, we remain as committed as always to attaining the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals.@@@At the outset, I am pleased to extend to Mr. Csaba Korosi my warmest congratulations on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session, and to wish him every success in performing his tasks.@@@I also thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his distinguished presidency of the seventy-sixth session.@@@I also cannot but to reiterate to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres our full support for his efforts and endeavours aimed at improving the performance of our Organization and strengthening its role in accordance with the three pillars of the Charter of the United Nations, namely, security, development and human rights.@@@Our session is taking place as the world is witnessing escalating tensions that threaten to have serious repercussions on the system of international relations, especially in light of the resurgence of the phenomenon of polarization, as is the case with the Ukraine crisis and its negative repercussions, which will significantly exacerbate existential challenges in vital areas.@@@That situation, with its complexities and dilemmas, which are difficult to anticipate in all their aspects in the current circumstances, highlights more than ever the structural imbalances that characterize global governance mechanisms and the urgent need to address them through an approach that ensures parity and equality among all countries and puts an end to the long-standing marginalization of developing countries.@@@The profound transformations we are witnessing today, despite the difficulties they entail, give us opportunities to correct the path we are on and to work to uphold the principles and purposes upon which our Organization was founded.@@@We therefore fully agree with the theme of the current session and believe that we are truly at a watershed moment in advancing multilateral action in the face of common challenges that prove day after day that our collective security is closely linked to the stability and prosperity of all our peoples, without exception.@@@My country, which this year celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of the restoration of its national independence and while resolutely pursuing the process of building a new Algeria under the leadership of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, stresses its commitment to those values and principles and its determination to make its contribution to maintaining international peace and security and achieving comprehensive, just and sustainable development.@@@In that spirit, Algeria is preparing to host an important summit of Arab countries on 1 and 2 November, and looks forward to making that event a milestone in the process of joint Arab action towards a more effective contribution by the Group of Arab States to addressing current regional and international challenges.@@@In that context, and in preparation for that important event, Algeria is pursuing its efforts to strengthen national unity among our Palestinian brothers in the light of the initiative launched by the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in line with the efforts of many sisterly Arab countries in this regard.@@@From this rostrum, I reaffirm that addressing the Palestinian question remains key to restoring security and stability in the Middle East region by consecrating the right of the brotherly Palestinian people to establish their independent State on the borders of 4 June 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, and ending the occupation of the Syrian Golan, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@In that regard, Algeria affirms its support for the request submitted by the State of Palestine for full membership of the United Nations, and looks forward to welcoming it soon as the 194th State Member of the United Nations.@@@With the same determination, Algeria reiterates once again its support for the right of the brotherly people of Western Sahara to end the occupation of their lands and to exercise their inalienable and imprescriptible right to self-determination and independence.@@@We call on the United Nations to redouble its efforts, through the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to help the two parties to the conflict — two States members of the African Union, namely, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic — to resume the course of direct negotiations with a view to reaching a political solution acceptable to both parties within the framework of international legitimacy.@@@Proceeding from its principled positions and adherence to the principles of non-alignment and by virtue of its rich history and experience in the field of international mediation, Algeria stresses the need for the international community to go beyond the logic of crisis management and focus instead on the search for solutions.@@@Whether the issue is related to cross-border threats or local conflicts, Algeria believes that the only way to sustainably break the vicious cycle of such crises is by addressing their root causes.@@@In that context, and in view of its leadership of the international mediation process and chairmanship of the Monitoring Committee on the implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Republic of Mali, emanating from the Algiers process, my country calls on the international community to support the Malian parties with a view to accelerating the implementation of all their commitments in light of the current delicate transitional phase in that brotherly country.@@@On neighbouring Libya, we stress once again the need to address the core of the crisis by ending foreign interference in all its forms in the affairs of that brotherly country, and to accompany the Libyan parties towards formulating the necessary agreements to move towards achieving the goals of national reconciliation and organizing free and fair elections that respond to the aspirations of the brotherly Libyan people to build their democratic and modern State.@@@At the regional level, the Sahel-Sahara region remains vulnerable to the challenges posed by the spread of terrorist threats and cross-border crimes against the background of the expansion of institutional instability, the exacerbation of development problems and the effects of climate change.@@@Faced with those crisis situations, and by virtue of its responsibilities as the African Union coordinator for efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism, as well as its policy of good-neighbourliness and solidarity, Algeria intends to intensify its efforts, in coordination with the concerned countries, to establish a new dynamic for the mechanisms of joint regional action so as to ensure joint and effective responses commensurate with the challenges posed by the threat of terrorism to all the peoples of the region.@@@Algeria is also working with its brothers from neighbouring countries to promote economic integration and sustainable development with a view to achieving shared prosperity that will enable the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen peace and security in the region.@@@In that regard, I stress that Algeria, which is proud of its African affiliation, remains an active party in
the project of integration, prosperity and political and economic independence of the African continent.@@@That can be achieved by eliminating the consequences of external interventions and moving to develop African solutions to African problems.@@@We therefore call on the international community to accompany the positive dynamic of the African continent by meeting its commitments and supporting the African Union Agenda 2063, which reflects a common vision for the future of the continent, while encouraging the establishment of balanced partnerships that respect the sovereign decisions taken by the countries of the African continent within the framework of the African Union.@@@We also firmly believe that recent developments have proven beyond any doubt that our African continent, the cradle of humankind and in no way resembling the stereotyped image promoted about it, is capable of presenting a new model of human civilization that places human beings and their environment at centre stage and paves the way for establishing friendly relations among States on the basis of justice and equality.@@@In the midst of these developments and aware of the magnitude of the unprecedented challenges at the international and regional levels, Algeria has submitted its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the period 2024-2025.@@@Its candidacy has been endorsed by the African Union, the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.@@@Algeria, which looks forward to enjoying the support of Member States in the elections scheduled for June next year, is committed to upholding the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and will work with the other members of the Council to give greater effectiveness to international efforts to prevent the outbreak of conflicts and resolve them through peaceful means.@@@We will also support the role of active regional organizations, encourage the prominent participation of women and young people in resolving crises and ensure the necessary protection for all vulnerable groups.@@@Undoubtedly, the international community is today at a critical juncture and required to take bold decisions to preserve its collective security and explore prospects for a promising future for all humankind.@@@From that perspective, Algeria recognizes the need to avoid the mistakes of the past and their consequences and calls for the consolidation of all our efforts to ensure the success of the reform path, leading to the establishment of a global system of equity, equality in sovereignty, mutual interests and constructive cooperation.@@@We need, now more than ever, to work together and be guided by the principle of our common destiny so as to avoid dangerous mistakes that threaten the return of the darkest chapters of contemporary human history.@@@For more than six months, the world has been living in the shadow of the conflict in Ukraine.@@@It is adversely affecting a great many people on the planet.@@@The conflict, like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that preceded it, has once again laid bare the downside of global interdependence.@@@This session provides a unique opportunity to take stock of the situation.@@@Let us, in a very honest and unbiased manner, answer two questions.@@@The answers to them, like the ensuing necessary action, is what all people around the globe expect from us, the United Nations Member States.@@@The first is: What are the root causes of the conflict in Ukraine?@@@The second is: What needs to be done to stop the conflict and prevent similar events from recurring in the future?@@@We are convinced that the conflict in Ukraine arises from a wider geopolitical chaos, whose causes must be sought in the events of 30 years ago.@@@History teaches us that epoch-making wars that end in unfair and humiliating peace terms contain the seeds of future conflicts.@@@Let us take a look at what kind of peace was established after the end of the last epochal confrontation — the Cold War.@@@The so-called winners, apparently influenced by euphoria, did not consider it necessary to draw on examples from the past.@@@After all, they could have followed the path of Alexander I, Metternich and Castlereagh.@@@Those great peacemakers of the early nineteenth century effectively integrated their adversaries into a new security system, thereby bringing lasting peace to Europe that would endure for decades to come.@@@Likewise, they could have drawn inspiration from the model of cooperation established during the Second World War by the “Big Three” — Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill — who forged arrangements that significantly narrowed opportunities for great Powers to wage wars against each other.@@@Nonetheless, unfortunately, the Western policymakers of the early 1990s chose the most inglorious and unpromising option, namely, the path of the 1919-style Versailles diplomats eager to trample upon their main opponent.@@@To begin with, the Cold War ended not even with an official treaty, but with some kind of gentlemen’s agreements and declarations.@@@As subsequent events revealed, the so-called winning side did not respect those arrangements; in fact, they were nothing more than a Versailles 2.0.@@@The West revealed its selfishness by offering to the post-Soviet States only one path, that of being its satellites.@@@To cement that status, the West relied on the expansion of one of its key Cold War-era institutions — the NATO military bloc.@@@NATO’s eastward expansion occurred despite the agreements achieved with the West, including those struck with the Soviet leaders.@@@The West overlooked the legitimate security interests of both Russia and Belarus.@@@In that regard, I recall the outstanding American diplomat George Kennan, whose foreign policy prophecies are so admired by Western policymakers.@@@Why did they fail to heed another of Kennan’s famous warnings when, in 1996, he condemned NATO expansion as “a strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions”?@@@With its drive to enlarge NATO, the West trampled upon the indivisibility of security, a vital principle according to which one party must not seek to achieve its own security at the expense of other parties.@@@The peacemakers of 1815 and 1945 grasped that logic very well, whereas the world leaders of 1919 and 1991 refused to embrace it.@@@NATO’s involvement in the illegal wars against Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria, in addition to the Alliance’s attempts to encroach on some historical Eastern Slavic and adjacent lands made it a foregone conclusion that Versailles 2.0. would suffer the fate of the first Versailles.@@@Therefore, it is the collective West that bears the full responsibility for the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine.@@@It was precisely the West that made the conflict inevitable, not only through its decision to expand NATO, but also by its refusal to consider the proposals of its opponents.@@@After all, such proposals were made.@@@The questions arises: What should be done?@@@Indeed, in 2009 Russia invited all interested parties to sign a new European security treaty that would de jure wrap up the Cold War.@@@The West rejected the proposal.@@@In 2017, it was President of Belarus Alyaksandr Lukashenko who came up with the idea of holding a global security dialogue and proposed Minsk as a venue for negotiations.@@@The opponents ignored that initiative as well.@@@Last December, the Russian Federation made yet another attempt to reach an agreement with the West on the issue of European security.@@@As before, the West remained deaf to the new Russian proposal.@@@What explains this rejectionist policy and stance of the West?@@@The key problem is the ongoing clash at the global level between two incompatible visions of the world order — one concentric, the other polycentric.@@@The West wants to establish a concentric or unipolar world, ruled from one centre and subordinated to the interests of a Western hegemon.@@@Most other countries wish to create a polycentric or multipolar world with no single centre of control and in which no one imposes its visions, interests or values on anyone else.@@@The West has dominated the world for the past five centuries, and believes that it can continue doing so indefinitely.@@@As for us, we are deeply convinced that the world has changed and that neocolonialism in any form is no longer an acceptable or viable option.@@@Five centuries ago, when the West was just beginning its global ascent, the world came to witness the Copernican revolution of knowledge.@@@That revolution took place, first and foremost, in the minds of the people of that time, who found it difficult to come to terms with the postulate that it was not the Earth but the Sun that stood at the centre of the solar system.@@@A similar Copernican paradigm shift must occur today.@@@As was the case half a millennium ago, it too must take place in people’s minds.@@@This time around, it must occur in the minds of the West’s political mainstream.@@@The West must, at last, recognize a number of truths.@@@First, international relations do not revolve around one single — that is, Western — centre of power.@@@Secondly, the world’s history has no end, because it is not an inexorable movement of all countries towards so-called liberal democracy.@@@Thirdly, the world is too complex a structure to reduce all its problems to a confrontation — as we have also heard from this rostrum — between the so-called democracies and autocracies.@@@That understanding, it would appear, has not yet registered with the West.@@@What we have seen instead is the destruction stubbornly pursued by the West, including self-destruction.@@@Economic sanctions are almost the only tool in the West’s foreign policy toolkit.@@@One cannot fail to sense that the very fact the sanctions have been imposed serves as an indicator of their effectiveness for Europe and the United States.@@@In that regard, we are witnessing a substitution of concepts.@@@The key objective has not been achieved, but the sanctions keep living a life of their own.@@@What common sense does the West invest in the unilateral, illegal economic sanctions it imposes against other countries?@@@Without any trace of hesitation, the goal has been stated loud and clear — to achieve a change of power in various countries through food riots provoked by sanctions.@@@This calculation has largely turned out to be a failure.@@@Most countries have not joined the effort to implement the sanctions.@@@Many States under sanctions, such as Belarus and Russia, are to a large extent self- sufficient.@@@Importantly, the sanctions have given us a powerful impetus to develop hidden internal reserves and reinvigorate regional integration.@@@Undoubtedly, we will weather the storm.@@@We will survive just as freedom-loving Cuba has been surviving illegal sanctions for more than six decades.@@@Nonetheless, the sanctions have had two negative repercussions that their sponsors could hardly have anticipated.@@@First, they have reduced the supply of fertilizer and food from the countries under sanctions.@@@As a result, those who suffer the most are the poorest people in developing countries.@@@Suffice it to say, prices in those countries have skyrocketed by 300 per cent over the past half a year, while Africa is facing fertilizer shortages to the tune of over 2 million tons.@@@Secondly, funnily enough, the sanctions have had a boomerang effect, hitting the West itself.@@@No matter how some may swagger today, ordinary people in Europe will, unfortunately, have to freeze through the coming winter.@@@It is high time for Western countries to resort to common sense and return to dialogue and cooperation.@@@Even in the current situation, Belarus stands ready to embrace dialogue and cooperation on equal terms, without preconditions or pressure.@@@Belarus, like many other countries, has spoken a great deal and everywhere about the conflict in Ukraine.@@@We cannot do otherwise.@@@The conflict is happening at our very doorstep.@@@We are extremely saddened to see the fraternal Ukrainian people fall victim to the collective West’s geopolitical games.@@@We are convinced that the origins of Ukraine’s now specific problems should be sought in 2004, when the West managed to carry out the first colour revolution in that country.@@@The second revolution, a decade later, firmly secured Ukraine’s status as anti-Russian.
Instigated by the United States and its allies, Ukraine has been exterminating the people of Donbas for eight years for no other reason than that the local people want to speak their native language, Russian.@@@But the West does not need Ukraine, neither as a member of NATO nor as a member of the European Union.@@@Its new patrons are simply using it in their own great game against Russia.@@@Today Ukraine is paying the price in blood because its politicians bought into that deception and disregarded the historical brotherhood of the three East Slavic peoples: Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians.@@@But it is never too late to admit and correct one’s mistakes.@@@For Belarus, which itself endured the genocide of the Belarusian people during the Second World War, when one in three people in our country was killed, it is unbearably painful to see the chaos in our neighbouring country and the suffering of ordinary Ukrainians.@@@Ever since 2014, we have been making every possible effort to bring peace to Ukraine.@@@It was our country in particular that became associated with peace in Donbas when the Minsk agreements were adopted in 2014 and 2015.@@@Right after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine in February, it was the President of Belarus who managed to get the parties to the conflict to sit down at the negotiating table, once again on Belarusian soil.@@@Belarus hosted three successful rounds of Ukrainian- Russian negotiations that opened real prospects for settling the conflict.@@@Regrettably, that process has since stalled.@@@We remain deeply convinced that both a ceasefire agreement and a comprehensive strategic peace settlement around Ukraine, in a broad context of regional and global security, can be achieved only at the negotiating table.@@@There is no alternative to talks.@@@Otherwise, we will all get a new third Versailles.@@@As a neighbour and an affected country, Belarus should be an integral part of the negotiation process and of final security guarantees.@@@We very much hope that the tragic events in Ukraine will compel the collective West to realize rather quickly that changes in international relations are irreversible.@@@The sooner that happens, the sooner peace can come to Ukraine and other hot spots, and the sooner we can lay the foundation of a new, just world order.@@@We believe that one crucial step in that process is a global security dialogue in the true spirit of San Francisco, whose urgency the President of Belarus clearly stated as far back as five years ago.@@@We have consistently highlighted the key role of the great Powers in this effort.@@@Unfortunately, as we are seeing today, they hear and understand each other poorly.@@@There is not the slightest hint that they are ready to move on from recriminations.@@@Perhaps the time has come for the countries representing the developing world to collectively take the lead in global security with all of the energy and dynamism they displayed with great success nearly half a century ago in advancing the idea of a new international economic order.@@@We believe that it is precisely now that the Non-Aligned Movement and the BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — as well as the regional integration unions, which are on the rise, must be directly and proactively involved in matters of global peace.@@@It is true that today, unfortunately, we do not have a clear concept for safeguarding the peace and security of our planet insofar because the world has become so complex that a multitude of diverse challenges defy any single framework.@@@What is more, the mechanisms for neutralizing the global challenges that were put in place in the framework of prior geopolitical realities are lagging behind in making the decisions that would fit the times, or stalling altogether.@@@The task facing humankind today is to ensure that our civilization is not destroyed as we transition to a new multipolar world order.@@@That is exactly what our common priority for action must be, including at the United Nations.@@@It is in this direction, provided we want to survive at all, that we must seek consensus and promptly forge new, adequate response mechanisms.@@@It is for the sake of that objective that we must immediately silence the mutually destructive rhetoric and put an end to the fatal total confrontation that leaves no room for diplomatic efforts.@@@That can be done only by responsible world leaders who, in the figurative expression of Henry Kissinger, “possess a sense of direction and mission”.@@@Leaders with such qualities are bound to emerge on the world stage.@@@Our present state of mind was well captured by Martin Luther King Jr. more than half a century ago when he said:
“We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow
is today.@@@We are confronted with the fierce urgency
of now.@@@In this unfolding conundrum of life and
history, there ‘is’ such a thing as being too late.”
Let us act before it is too late.@@@Belarus, for its part, stands ready to play the role of a vigorously engaged and responsible stakeholder in security processes at the global and regional levels alike.@@@I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also commend Secretary- General Antonio Guterres for his commitment to world peace and Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives for the results that he achieved during his term.@@@Much has been said by the eminent speakers who have stood before me on this rostrum, which allows me to avoid certain repetition.@@@The time has come for us to think of a global and lasting solution based on solidarity, sustainability and science, as the focus of this session calls on us to do.@@@The solution to many of our problems is in joint reflection, global solidarity and the pursuit of concerted and collective actions.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic has tragically reminded us that we live in a globalized world, that the lives of all human beings have equal value, that humankind is one and that we have a shared destiny.@@@We must share scientific knowledge and ensure equitable access to vaccines.@@@Over the past two years, we have been able to create greater political stability in our country, reaffirm our role on the African continent and reclaim our place in the concert of nations.@@@However, the international context does not favour a full implementation of our development plan, particularly with respect to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In Africa, we are also feeling the consequences of the war in Ukraine, whose impact is unfortunately broad, particularly in the energy and agricultural sectors.@@@Inflation and increased prices for grains and other staples have considerably aggravated a food situation that was already challenging.@@@Guinea-Bissau is a coastal country with a great number of islands.@@@We have dedicated much effort to mitigation and adaptation.@@@We hope that the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be a deciding step in defining and adopting concrete strategies to minimize the negative impacts of climate change.@@@Allow me, as Chairman of the Authority of the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to recall that our subregion faces great security challenges and that we need peace in order to ensure the development and well-being of our people, who are our primary wealth.@@@The stability of a large part of our continent in general, and of West Africa in particular, is threatened by the insecurity caused by terrorism, violent extremism and transnational crime, which violate the principles of the rule of law and democracy.@@@ECOWAS created a political and legal framework and structural mechanisms to prevent and resolve political and institutional crises.@@@However, the challenges continue to be numerous and difficult to overcome.@@@We need international assistance to stop the advance of terrorism in West Africa and in the entire Sahel region.@@@This is a threat to international peace and security, and, in order to combat it effectively, we must involve the entire international community, and the United Nations in particular.@@@I was recently chosen to chair the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.@@@According to data from the World Health Organization, 96 per cent of malaria cases globally and 98 per cent of malaria deaths occur in Africa.@@@Our continent has not achieved the established goal of reducing malaria incidence and mortality by 40 per cent by 2020, which would have been a fundamental step in eliminating malaria on the African continent by 2030.@@@Therefore, we need more than ever to adopt appropriate measures to protect everyone, everywhere, from infectious diseases.@@@I take this opportunity to call on all countries, Governments, donors and development partners to contribute to the replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.@@@Together and in solidarity, we can end malaria once and for all and save millions of human lives.@@@Speaking of solidarity among States and peoples, we cannot forget to mention Cuba and the need for the United States embargo against our fellow nation to be lifted immediately.@@@In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Guinea-Bissau, despite being a small country with limited means, will spare no effort to contribute to maintaining peace, stability and security on our planet.@@@We are resolute in continuing to actively participate in the consolidation of multilateralism and the promotion of dialogue and cooperation among the nations and peoples of the world.@@@This year Ireland marks the centenary of its independence.@@@The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922, when we began our journey as an independent sovereign nation.@@@From the start of that journey, we were a nation that looked outwards.@@@One of our first acts was to apply to join the League of Nations.@@@The following year, in his first address to the Assembly of the League of Nations, the then President of the Irish Government’s Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, spoke of Ireland’s desire to “avert the ancient evils of warfare and oppression; to encourage wholesome, and to discourage unwholesome relations between nation and nation; to enable even the weakest of nations to live their own lives and make their own proper contribution to the good of all, free even from the shadow and the fear of external violence, vicious penetration or injurious pressure of any kind”.@@@Those are the ideals that guide Ireland’s foreign policy.@@@Those same principles, articulated 100 years ago by the League’s newest member, continue to inform our actions today — the belief that all countries have an equal right to live in peace; that all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security and to economic and social development; and that all people have the right to live in dignity and to have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected.@@@One hundred years later, we as a global community are very far from living up to those principles.@@@We are convening here at a time of crisis, when we are yet again facing the threat of widespread global hunger and food insecurity; when we see daily the devastating impacts of climate change, with those who bear no responsibility for its causes being most affected; when we have witnessed the most blatant disregard for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations on my own home continent of Europe; and when much of the progress that we were making towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has stalled or gone into reverse as we grapple with the continuing effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@It does not have to be this way.@@@We have the tools and the systems to address those issues.@@@In the General Assembly and the other organs, institutions and agencies that make up the United Nations, we have the spaces to discuss, negotiate, share experiences and craft solutions.@@@We have an interlocking web of charters, treaties, norms, resolutions, international jurisprudence, political declarations and agreed conclusions.@@@Our global structures are not perfect.@@@We know that.@@@No structures ever are.@@@There is much that needs reform.@@@But it is not our systems or our structures, our treaties or charters, that are fundamentally failing us.@@@It is the lack of political will to implement and uphold them.@@@I began my statement by quoting a former Irish Leader speaking to the League of Nations Assembly, almost 100 years ago.@@@Let me quote another Irish leader and former President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera, also speaking to the League of Nations, exactly 90 years ago today.@@@De Valera believed in the League’s potential to protect small nations through collective security.@@@But he recognized that in order to be effective, the League’s Covenant had to be enforced and Member States had to fulfil their obligations.@@@In his speech in September 1932, he warned that world opinion was losing faith in the League’s capacity to protect peace and stability.@@@He said,
“People are complaining that the League is devoting its activity to matters of secondary or very minor importance, while the vital international problems of the day ... are being shelved or postponed or ignored”.@@@Ninety years on, we cannot continue to shelve, postpone or ignore our existential global challenges.@@@As an elected member of the Security Council, Ireland has seen first-hand that political will and a commitment to the principles of the Charter can deliver results.@@@On Syria, Ireland has worked in partnership with Norway, and with all Council members, to ensure that humanitarian aid can continue to reach the millions who need it.@@@During our 18 months on the Council, we have twice renewed the United Nations cross-border operations, which provide crucial aid to 4 million people in the north-west of the country.@@@Ireland will continue to work to keep that critical lifeline open.@@@We urge other members of the Council to support their further renewal.@@@To do otherwise would have devastating consequences for the people of Syria.@@@We have worked with our partners on the Council to extend and renew the mandates of the 14 United Nations peacekeeping operations and the many United Nations special political missions that require the Council’s approval.@@@Day after day, across the globe, the military and civilian personnel in those missions protect civilians, monitor ceasefires, support peacebuilding, facilitate negotiations and verify the implementation of peace agreements.@@@Among them are hundreds of Irish men and women, who carry on our proud tradition of peacekeeping and crisis management.@@@We are deeply proud of their service.@@@In an echo of that tradition last year, Ireland led work on Security Council resolution 2594 (2021), the Council’s first-ever resolution on peacekeeping transitions.@@@Adopted with the support of all Council members, it will help to ensure that the hard- won gains of peace are maintained when a peacekeeping mission ends.@@@It puts the protection of civilians at the centre of United Nations planning for transitioning from military peacekeeping operations into civilian-led political missions in countries emerging from conflict.@@@We have also seen progress on the women and peace and security agenda.@@@As co-Chair, together with Mexico, of the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security, Ireland has ensured that the role of women as peacebuilders and agents of change is at the heart of United Nations peacekeeping and political missions across the globe.@@@We have brought the voices of grass-roots women peacebuilders to the Council table, with a record 16 women civil-society briefers during our presidency of the Council in September.@@@Our commitment to the protection of civilians has also informed our work in leading negotiations earlier this year to agree on a political declaration on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.@@@The declaration is a significant milestone that recognizes the humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and includes a number of ambitious actions to address them.@@@I look forward to its formal adoption at a high-level international conference in Dublin on 18 November.@@@We have been encouraged by those successes, incremental though some of them are.@@@But at times we have also been deeply frustrated by the Security Council’s failure to act.@@@A year ago I stood before the Assembly (see A/76/PV.13) and spoke of our ambition for the Council to adopt a resolution on climate and security.@@@Together with the Niger, we worked tirelessly to craft a draft resolution in the Council that reflected the reality that climate change is increasingly driving insecurity and acting as a threat multiplier.@@@We challenged the Council to take on its responsibility to address the impact of climate change on international peace and security, and 113 countries — 113 members of the Assembly — supported us in our efforts.@@@One country — Russia — vetoed those efforts.@@@It frankly beggars belief that in 2022, the United Nations organ charged with the maintenance of peace and security has still not accepted its responsibilities in this area.@@@It is a singular failure of political will and political responsibility.@@@A year ago, I also spoke to the Assembly about Ireland’s deep concern about the situation in Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, the looming humanitarian catastrophe there and the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.@@@I spoke of the vital need for a negotiated ceasefire, unfettered humanitarian access, the restoration of basic services and a political solution to the crisis.@@@Yet a year later, we continue to raise the alarm.@@@We continue to urge the Council to act decisively.@@@We continue with our determination to support a political solution and seek accountability for gross human rights abuses.@@@Every month, the Security Council meets to discuss the situation in Palestine.@@@Every month, Ireland, together with many of our fellow members of the Council, has reiterated its firm commitment to a two-State solution, with a viable Palestinian State based on the 1967 borders, living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States.@@@But we are no nearer today to that aim than we were when we joined the Council 18 months ago — and, truth be told, long before that.@@@Israel’s settlement building continues — knowingly and deliberately, it would seem — to undermine the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State and to jeopardize the possibility of a two-State solution.@@@Settlements are a clear violation of international law and today stand in the way of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.@@@We should be clear that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is untenable.@@@We cannot and must not become inured to it.@@@We cannot tolerate a situation where young Palestinian people have no confidence in political progress and no hope for the future.@@@The very real risk is that the space for the political middle ground is being squeezed out, further lessening the prospects of a just and lasting solution.@@@The international community must renew its efforts.@@@Progress will not be possible without addressing the root causes of the conflict.@@@The Security Council must fulfil its responsibilities.@@@Crucially, it must work for compliance with its own resolutions.@@@With regard to Afghanistan, since the Taliban takeover of Kabul Ireland has resolutely defended the human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and we have increased our humanitarian aid.@@@We helped to ensure that the mandate for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, adopted in March through Security Council resolution 2626 (2022), was directly informed by the courageous activism of Afghan women.@@@And we have pushed for accountability for the Taliban’s actions.@@@But we continue to witness the ongoing erosion of the rights of Afghan citizens, particularly women and girls, as well as those of ethnic and religious minorities and the LGBTQI+ community.@@@September is a month when many students around the world return to school.@@@For girls in Afghanistan, there is no return.@@@They have now been out of school for more than a year.@@@That is a clear violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms.@@@Their potential
will not be fulfilled and that of Afghanistan will be weakened if the situation continues to prevail.@@@At this time of heightened nuclear threat, it is deeply regrettable that one country alone—Russia—prevented an agreement from being reached at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last month.@@@The heightened nuclear risks arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the threats to nuclear safety and security resulting from military activity in and near civilian nuclear facilities in Ukraine are unprecedented.@@@The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must remain an essential element of international peace and security.@@@The urgency of its full implementation cannot be overstated.@@@In the past few days, many of my colleagues in this Hall have spoken of Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine.@@@For European Member States in particular@@@it carries dark echoes of our continent’s past.@@@We face an expansionist Power brutally invading and occupying a peaceful neighbour.@@@While we in Europe faced that many times in the twentieth century, we did not think we would face it again in the twenty-first.@@@But this is not just a European issue or a concern for the West.@@@All States, and particularly small countries such as my own, should fear a world where might equals right, where the strong can bully the weak, where sovereignty and territorial integrity can be blatantly violated and where the Charter that all of us in the Assembly have faithfully put our trust in can be flouted with impunity.@@@In Ukraine in July, I heard first-hand accounts from civilians of the brutality and violence visited on men, women and children by the occupying Russian forces.@@@Where Russia’s forces have been pushed back, we have seen the wanton destruction and the uncovering of mass civilian graves such as in Bucha and, more recently, Izyum.@@@We have seen the targeting of nuclear facilities and of civilian infrastructure.@@@And now we see President Putin’s planned sham referendums in eastern Ukraine, aimed at forcibly changing its borders, in clear violation of the Charter.@@@We have to name what we are seeing.@@@Those actions, taken collectively, show Russia behaving like a rogue State.@@@We are also seeing how the impact of Russia’s aggression reaches far beyond Ukrainian or European shores and borders.@@@From the Horn of Africa to the Sahel and beyond, food insecurity has reached a critical tipping point.@@@Some of the countries that have been the worst affected by the current food-insecurity crisis are those most reliant on imports of wheat from Russia and Ukraine.@@@Combined with the impact of climate change, conflict, severe drought and other extreme weather events, we are facing a crisis that requires urgent action.@@@Like many others represented in this Hall, Ireland has responded by increasing its humanitarian aid.@@@That has included direct humanitarian support of €78 million for the Horn of Africa and sustained and early funding to other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel.@@@Yesterday, together with the United States, UNICEF and others, Ireland led a pledging event at which we committed an additional €50 million over three years specifically to tackle acute child malnutrition.@@@We have also increased our core funding to the Central Emergency Response Fund in recognition of the critical importance of enabling United Nations agencies to respond rapidly as crises unfold.@@@We have prioritized gender responsiveness in our humanitarian work, addressing the particular vulnerabilities faced by women, girls and boys in emergency settings.@@@And we have adapted our funding and our programming so that we respond to humanitarian emergencies in a way that underpins our climate, development and peacebuilding interventions and builds the resilience of individuals, families and communities.@@@The link between conflict and food insecurity is irrefutable.@@@That is why we focused on hunger and conflict as a priority for our term on the Security Council.@@@Conflict is now the main driver of hunger, reversing some of the gains made during recent decades.@@@We are failing in the challenge to reach zero hunger.@@@Ireland’s long-standing commitment to food security will guide our international cooperation for many years to come.@@@Ending world hunger and ensuring the right to food must be placed firmly at the top of the political agenda.@@@At major summits over the past 12 months on food systems and nutrition for growth and at the European Union-African Union Summit, Ireland has committed to helping partner countries on their journey towards sustainable, resilient and nutritious food systems.@@@That transformation is more urgent now than ever.@@@At the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year, we will be at the forefront of efforts to combat the existential threat of climate change.@@@Adaptation to climate change and its effects will remain a key focus of our international engagement and support.@@@We must make progress on averting,
minimizing and addressing losses and damages that are a direct result of our changing climate.@@@On global health, Ireland has strongly supported the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria since its inception 20 years ago.@@@This week we announced a significant new contribution of €65 million over three years — a 30 per cent increase over our previous such contribution — to support their important work against those diseases, as well as the related strengthening of health systems.@@@The United Nations and the rules-based international order are central to who we are as a nation.@@@But multilateralism can succeed only if it is effective, and it can be effective only if we, the Member States, allow it to be so.@@@That takes courage, political will and commitment to collective solutions to global challenges.@@@It takes a readiness to compromise, and it takes a genuine belief in the principles of the Charter.@@@When, in 100 years’ time, a future Irish leader marks the bicentenary of Ireland’s independence and returns to this Hall, I hope that he or she will be making a very different speech — one that celebrates substantive, sustained progress in ending conflict and tackling global inequality, poverty and hunger; one that will not cite frustrations over the use of the veto in the Security Council to thwart the will of a majority of Member States, because the veto will be an anachronism that has long ceased to exist; one that refers to a strengthened and reformed United Nations system, structured and equipped to tackle the challenges of its day; one that remarks on the common will to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that looks back with relief at the collective action that brought this planet back from the brink of catastrophic collapse.@@@Let me first congratulate Your Excellency,@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also commend my good friend, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his stalwart leadership of the seventy-sixth session during a most challenging year.@@@This session of the General Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple concurrent crises.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international law and the Charter of the United Nations and undermines the rules-based order.@@@We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of more Ukrainian territory.@@@The multilateral system, which has contributed greatly to global peace and security, is now being severely tested.@@@At the same time, super-Power rivalry continues to sharpen.@@@As we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year, the risks of accident, miscalculation, confrontation and even outright conflict have escalated.@@@The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation to resort to unilateralism has become even stronger.@@@But the need for concerted global cooperation has never been greater or more urgent, given the range of transnational challenges that all of us are confronting today.@@@Our recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains uneven and fragile.@@@In fact, the risk of a future and even more deadly pandemic has risen.@@@The global economy is entering a period of higher and prolonged inflation, and we are seeing higher interest rates all over the world.@@@Energy prices have soared, and it will become even harder to generate the resources that all of us need to address those long-term problems.@@@Societies everywhere will have to grapple with greater internal division, disruption and polarization.@@@Without that sense of cohesion, unity, trust or even an ability to agree on facts, the will and unity needed for societies to confront those existential challenges will be undermined severely.@@@The climate crisis is a clear and present threat.@@@Our global commons, including water and biodiversity, are also deteriorating rapidly.@@@Our global food supply is at risk.@@@To make things worse, all those threats and crises are occurring concurrently, interacting with and compounding each other in a vicious circle.@@@For instance, the Secretary-General has spoken of a triple crisis of food, fuel and finance.@@@The impact of all those simultaneous crises on ordinary people and our livelihoods has been severe, all the more so in developing countries.@@@We see this in the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan and in parts of Africa.@@@The post-Second World War era of relative stability and prosperity has, unfortunately, come to an end.@@@A new world order is being born and, as any obstetrician will tell you, the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous.@@@Will we have a more divided, less prosperous and less peaceful world?@@@Or can we instead strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future, uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system, and jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies: including digital technology, synthetic biology, customized health care and , of course, renewable energy?@@@If we can do that, we can create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone.@@@Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since the Second World War.@@@That is also why we worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States (FOSS) in 1992.@@@We started small, with only 16 countries.@@@This year, we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of FOSS.@@@We now have 108 countries — a majority at the United Nations.@@@We are all proud members.@@@FOSS has always been a champion of the United Nations and rules-based multilateralism.@@@It gives us a collective stake and a voice in the global commons, a means to safeguard our interests, and a system where we have sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully, in accordance with international law.@@@Indeed, the profound importance of multilateralism and international law is precisely why Singapore has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.@@@The security and even the existence of Singapore — and indeed many other countries, especially small States — depend on the international community upholding the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@If we do not protect these principles, there is no basis for countries, big and small, to cooperate on an equal footing.@@@Small States especially must not allow the world to regress to one where might is right.@@@While the rules-based multilateral system is not perfect, it is by far our best option in addressing transnational challenges and managing the global commons.@@@This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 40 years ago.@@@It brought order and predictability to the governance of our oceans and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together.@@@The geopolitical reality today makes it harder to forge consensus on such a framework, but as our experience with COVID-19 has shown, multilateral cooperation is the only way forward.@@@Ultimately, we share one planet.@@@Despite our differences, our destinies are interwoven and no one is safe until all of us are safe.@@@This applies to pandemics; it also applies to climate change, the conservation of the oceans and all our other shared challenges.@@@Singapore will do our part.@@@We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee serves as the President of the Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond areas of national jurisdiction, which is negotiating a treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ).@@@We call on all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust and future-proof BBNJ treaty.@@@There is much more we can do to re-energize and transform the United Nations-based multilateral system towards new realities and challenges.@@@I commend the leadership of the Secretary-General in putting forth a bold and ambitious Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) report to do so.@@@Let me focus on just three areas in our global commons where there is an urgent need to build resilience:
First is climate change and food insecurity, global health and pandemic preparedness, and digital transformation and cybersecurity.@@@Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting humankind today, as we have seen from the more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and the devastation that they have wrought the world over.@@@We need a sustained and ambitious global response.@@@The continued commitment of all countries to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Glasgow Climate Pact is absolutely critical.@@@We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero.@@@That will, in fact, be the biggest socioeconomic transformation since the industrial revolution.@@@Both will require considerable economic restructuring, technological breakthroughs, investments and behavioural changes.@@@The United Nations-led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone behind.@@@Singapore, as a small, low-lying and alternative-energy disadvantaged island nation, is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels.@@@Singapore’s impact on global emissions is infinitely small, but we take our climate action obligations very seriously.@@@We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century.@@@A comprehensive strategy to green our economy is taking shape, and we will raise carbon taxes progressively from 2024.@@@We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero.@@@We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia.@@@We are also building capabilities in environmental risk management in the financial sector and providing grants to defray the costs of green and sustainability- linked loans and bonds.@@@An adjacent issue is food insecurity.@@@Climate change, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat to our food security.@@@According to a United Nations report, as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger last year; that is 46 million more than in 2020 and 150 million more than in 2019.@@@We must reverse this negative trend.@@@First, we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly.@@@Secondly, we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges — for example, working together to develop climate-resilient food systems, while developing the necessary precautions on food safety.@@@There is much scope for multilateral cooperation on capacity-building and the development of global norms and standards.@@@Next, it is essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect our future generations.@@@After COVID-19, there will be other pandemics and major health emergencies.@@@In my view, COVID-19 was perhaps a dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come.@@@We must be better prepared to predict,
prevent, detect, assess and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion in the future.@@@We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding underinvestment in pandemic preparedness, amongst other global public goods.@@@Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen the global health security system.@@@We will continue to support the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, and we have contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, hosted by the World Bank.@@@Lastly, we must enhance international cooperation to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution.@@@Digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum.@@@It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues: geopolitical tensions, technological bifurcation, cybersecurity threats and the digital divide.@@@The world has made significant progress in development by operating on a single, shared technology stack.@@@Interconnectedness and interoperability brought us together, lowered costs and spurred innovation, competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas.@@@But if we fractured our world and our technology stack, all that good work and the speed of progress and innovation will slow significantly.@@@We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and optimize the opportunities of digital transformation, while effectively addressing its challenges.@@@A zero- sum, exclusionary and bifurcated approach benefits no one.@@@An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyberthreats and malicious cyberactivities.@@@We must also ensure that all States, particularly small States, developing and least developed countries benefit from the digital revolution and are not left further behind.@@@Singapore fully supports the Secretary-General’s proposal for a global digital compact, which has received strong support from Member States.@@@We are honoured that Ambassador Burhan Gafoor serves as Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies.@@@The consensus adoption of the Working Group’s first annual progress report in July was a welcome sign that multilateralism is alive and well and can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons, even in these difficult times.@@@In conclusion, this is a moment when multilateralism must be defended and fortified.@@@Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism, especially including adherence to the United Nations Charter and international law.@@@I remain an optimist in these difficult times and believe that we are actually on the cusp of an era of profound technological breakthroughs, one that will equip humankind with unimaginably powerful new tools.@@@It is in the world’s interest and in our own long-term national interests to set aside our differences, address the challenges of the global commons and harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies.@@@Ultimately, as Member States, we have as much responsibility to each other and to our citizens to work together and to improve, adapt and strengthen the multilateral system that we have so painstakingly built over the past 77 years, so that our people — all people — can lead better, more secure, more peaceful and happier lives.@@@I congratulate my successor, His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@Allow me to also take this opportunity to express my profound thanks to the many Heads of State and Government and ministers who have said very kind words in recognition of the achievements of my presidency of hope during the seventy-sixth session.@@@I am truly humbled by their sentiments.@@@Mr. Korosi takes stewardship of the Assembly in extraordinary times.@@@Not since 1945 have we witnessed the international agenda grow in scale so drastically
and so relentlessly.@@@As conflicts grow, as the climate crisis rages, as economies lie in shambles and as we emerge from an era-defining pandemic, we are left anxious and fearful.@@@Yet we cannot retreat or linger in despair.@@@Instead, this moment should make us reflect on the kind of world we want going forward.@@@How can we make it more resilient and more just?@@@The Maldives proposes five main areas of focus.@@@First, we need to address the raging climate crisis.@@@That crisis remains an existential threat, especially to small island developing States.@@@For us, the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is death.@@@Internationally, the Maldives will continue to lead the way in climate action.@@@In doing so, we will continue to advocate for a rights-based approach.@@@In 2008, the Maldives and other like-minded countries pursued Human Rights Council resolution 7/23, on human rights and climate change.@@@After decades of advocacy at the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, in July we celebrated, in this Hall, the adoption of the landmark resolution 76/300, recognizing the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.@@@We are once again competing for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2023-2025 term.@@@If elected, addressing climate change as an integral part of the global human rights discourse will be among our priorities.@@@We hope to have members’ support for our candidature.@@@The Maldives will also set a national example.@@@Like other small island developing States, we make only a miniscule contribution to global carbon emissions.@@@We will be the first to bear the consequences, yet we are the ones with some of the most ambitious climate action targets.@@@We are pursuing an ambitious national plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 — a goal we can meet only with international support.@@@This year, we launched the Glasgow-Sharm El-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation in the Maldives, with a view to supporting global action.@@@I urge the global community to do more.@@@We must act before it is too late.@@@We also urgently need to protect our oceans.@@@The Maldives is a large ocean State.@@@Our lives, livelihoods, culture and traditions are linked to the ocean.@@@That is why we support the global initiative to protect 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030.@@@Nationally, we have been working to protect our exclusive economic zone.@@@We have now designated 79 marine-protected areas, including 14 per cent of our coral reefs.@@@Considering the damage caused by plastics to maritime ecosystems, we have also implemented a ban on the importation, production and sale of several types of single-use plastics.@@@We have set a national target to fully phase out single-use plastics by 2030.@@@We have only one planet.@@@Protecting it is our only choice if we care about our continued survival.@@@Secondly, we need sustainable and reliable sources of financing.@@@In 2009 in Copenhagen, an ambitious pledge was made that $100 billion in climate financing would be mobilized by 2020.@@@Even in 2022, we are far short of meeting that pledge.@@@Partners must scale up their efforts to make up the difference and we urge our partners to redouble adaptation finance as agreed under the Glasgow Climate Pact in 2021.@@@It is also important to make access easier for all, especially developing countries and small island developing States in particular.@@@We know that the world can mobilize resources when required.@@@We know that we have the finances, but we need to direct them.@@@We need to make assessments to make that financing fairer.@@@That is why we have always been staunch supporters of alternative measures to gross domestic product.@@@Traditional measures of development fail to accurately capture the vulnerabilities of countries and their resilience against external shocks.@@@In that context, we look forward to the finalization of the multidimensional vulnerability index by the end of the year and its swift utilization.@@@Thirdly, we need gender equality to be at the forefront of our agenda.@@@For centuries, women have had their contributions undervalued and their voices entirely discounted.@@@That injustice cannot continue.@@@We cannot solve the challenges facing all of humankind while half of it is denied their full potential.@@@Women deserve an equal seat at the table.@@@The Maldives is advancing many legislative and executive initiatives to advance women’s representation.@@@The Government has passed legislation to allocate 33 per cent of our local council seats to women.@@@We have appointed women as Supreme Court justices for the first time.@@@Half of our ambassadors overseas are women.@@@Despite the progress made, much remains to be done.@@@Women continue to face a variety of challenges, including misogyny and gender-based violence.@@@We can and must do better.@@@Fourthly, it is vital that the world come together to meet the peace and security challenges we face.@@@We need to work harder to stop conflicts and the flagrant violations of international norms undermining the multilateral system we have painstakingly built over the past 77 years.@@@The people of Ukraine, Afghanistan and Myanmar, among other countries plunged into conflict and bloodshed, deserve peace.@@@They deserve an end to the ongoing tragedies upending their lives.@@@It is the same for the people of Palestine.@@@The Maldives reiterates that a two-State solution based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, is the only meaningful solution for a lasting peace.@@@Addressing terrorism should also be a priority.@@@Its menace continues to plague our world and jeopardize the safety and cohesion of our societies.@@@The Maldives condemns terrorism in all its forms and will work with the international community to comprehensively combat both terrorism and violent ideologies.@@@The issues of our time are complex and multifaceted.@@@We cannot apply old solutions to new challenges That brings me to my fifth and final point.@@@It is vital that we reform the multilateral system and better equip the United Nations to meet contemporary and future challenges.@@@What we need is a United Nations 2.0.@@@That is the thrust of the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We wholeheartedly welcome the recent adoption by consensus of resolution 76/306, establishing the United Nations Youth Office, carrying forward one of the report’s most important recommendations.@@@We agree with the underlying spirit of that resolution.@@@We cannot continue to deny the voices of the 1.8 billion young people, especially on decisions that impact their futures.@@@The Maldives will constructively engage with Member States to continue the follow-up process on Our Common Agenda.@@@Another critical aspect of revitalizing the United Nations should be reforming the Security Council — a goal the Maldives has advocated for decades.@@@We have consistently called for an increase in the number of both permanent and non-permanent seats, while ensuring equitable geographic representation, to make the Council more responsive and responsible.@@@We also support increasing the substantial role and moral authority of the General Assembly.@@@A welcome decision in that regard was the recent adoption of the veto initiative — a resolution that Maldives was happy to support (resolution 76/262).@@@The Maldives has always believed that our small size should not diminish our standing in the international arena.@@@We believe that a rules-based international order, in which all States have a voice and are fairly represented and included, is necessary.@@@It is our hope that our ongoing efforts aimed at multilateral reform culminate in such an outcome.@@@The extraordinary times we face must be met with extraordinary courage, extraordinary vision, extraordinary ambition and extraordinary leadership.@@@As we look ahead, the tasks before us may seem daunting.@@@They are immense in scale and borderless in their dimensions.@@@They are beyond the capacity of any one single country to address by itself.@@@But together, we can meet those challenges.@@@Together, we have the resources, the power and the imagination to usher in a brighter future for humankind.@@@The Maldives will continue to work alongside our peers and nations in the international community to deliver that vision.@@@Together, we can.@@@I was born after the Second World War.@@@All my life the cry “Never again!” has echoed around the world, especially in Europe.@@@With the exception of the war in the Balkans, even the major geopolitical changes in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall have been peaceful.@@@That has made an important contribution to building hope for lasting peace.@@@That hope has been thoroughly shaken by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.@@@Will that make us stop believing in the possibility of lasting peace?@@@I think it will not.@@@We must not leave our children in fear of war.@@@For the sake of their secure future, we have a duty to do whatever we can to ensure that the precious
hope for a lasting peace returns to our hearts.@@@After all, it was with that hope and our shared responsibility that the United Nations was founded.@@@The United Nations has set very clear rules of engagement to which all Members have committed themselves, including a commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, cooperation and respect for fundamental human dignity.@@@I wish to speak about peace, climate change and multilateralism today.@@@First, with regard to peace and security, the Russian Federation’s decision to conduct a military attack on Ukraine has shaken those rules, as have many other armed conflicts in different parts of the world.@@@The Russian aggression has put international security at risk.@@@Yesterday’s announcement by President Putin that a referendum will be held in parts of Ukraine is a continuation of aggression and is in breach of international law.@@@I especially condemn his words about the possible use of nuclear weapons.@@@The war is threatening the already fragile stability of the Western Balkans.@@@It has also threatened international food and energy security.@@@I commend the Secretary-General for his engagement, and Tiirkiye for its support in reaching the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@Peace, as I just said, is not just the absence of war.@@@In peace, leaders should strengthen and nurture good relations with other countries.@@@It is our obligation to resolve outstanding issues in a spirit of compromise and mutual understanding.@@@Only in that way will we reduce the chances that old grievances and historical traumas will re-emerge.@@@I am grateful to many here for the opportunity to build good relations together for the benefit and wellbeing of our countries and the wider international community.@@@Fostering good relations and building trust within and among societies is the most effective means of preventing armed conflicts.@@@Secondly, we need more cooperation for a better future.@@@Nurturing and strengthening good relations among countries is also necessary to more efficiently address the challenges of our times, of which climate change is one of the most pressing.@@@Our common task is to preserve the planet for future generations.@@@What we need is more efficient measures and more solidarity.@@@Slovenia pledges special support to Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific to assist them in their efforts against biodiversity loss, water stress and climate damage.@@@We are contributing to the Least Developed Countries Fund of the Global Environment Facility.@@@Having initiated the Green Group, Slovenia is working with like-minded countries on the promotion of green policies.@@@We are deeply grateful to the General Assembly for the historic universal recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.@@@Slovenia was one of its original proponents, along with Costa Rica, Maldives, Morocco and Switzerland.@@@That was a much-needed boost for multilateralism, but we can and should do more.@@@The upcoming United Nations conferences on climate change, biodiversity and water are an excellent opportunity to commit ourselves to do more and do better.@@@I wish to thank the Secretary-General for issuing his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We support the proposed holding of a second world social summit in 2025 and expect it to address the challenges of structural inequalities.@@@There is no security and development without respect for human dignity.@@@In all our efforts, we should lead with a rights-based approach.@@@We should be attentive to all signs of human rights regression and should act accordingly.@@@Thirdly and finally, with regard to strengthening multilateralism and candidatures for the Security Council, the Charter of the United Nations is fundamental to our international system.@@@A rules-based order is a sine qua non for maintaining peace and security, a just and balanced international system.@@@Slovenia has proved itself a reliable and trustworthy member of the United Nations family and an honest broker.@@@We are engaged in a genuine dialogue and a constant search for creative and good solutions to our common challenges.@@@We are part of peacemaking and stabilization efforts that include humanitarian demining, rehabilitation and saving the lives of civilians all around the globe.@@@We actively participate in efforts to strengthen the legal framework and respect for international law, including efforts to end impunity.@@@We are building trust to secure
a better future.@@@Slovenia has no enemies, but only friends all around the globe.@@@My country is well placed to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2024 to 2025.@@@We will strive unwaveringly for peace, justice, mutual understanding and reconciliation, both within and among societies, as well as for respect for ethnic, national and religious diversity and the promotion of sustainable development and solidarity.@@@That is Slovenia’s task, and it is our common task.@@@It is an honour to return to the General Assembly, although I wish I were here with a more positive message given all the challenges and tribulations that the world has been through in the past few years.@@@However, my statement will focus on the latest Azerbaijani unprovoked aggression against the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia and its overall impact on stability in the South Caucasus.@@@On 13 September, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Armenia.@@@Using heavy artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems and combat unmanned aerial vehicles, the Azerbaijani armed forces shelled 36 residential areas and communities, including the towns of Goris, Jermuk, Vardenis, Kapan and Geghamasar, deep within the sovereign territory of Armenia.@@@That was not a border clash.@@@It was a direct, undeniable attack against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Armenia, which was condemned and addressed during the most recent Security Council meeting (see S/PV.9132) and beyond.@@@The Azerbaijani attack deliberately targeted the civilian population and vital civilian infrastructure.@@@Jermuk is one of the main health tourism and resort sites of Armenia.@@@As a result of the Azerbaijani aggression, all the hotels, resort facilities and health centres of Jermuk are now closed.@@@All the residents of that town are displaced.@@@Overall, the number of those temporarily displaced from the Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor and Syunik regions of Armenia is more than 7,600 persons, mostly women and elderly people, among them 1,437 children and 99 persons with disabilities.@@@Around 192 houses, three hotels, two schools and one medical facility were partially or completely destroyed.@@@Seven electrical infrastructures, five water infrastructures, three gas pipelines and one bridge were damaged.@@@Two ambulances and four private cars were shelled.@@@The Kechut water reservoir was targeted and shelled.@@@Journalists and ambulance vehicles were also targeted and shelled.@@@As a result of the aggression, at the moment the number of victims and missing persons exceeds 207, among whom three civilians were killed and two civilians are missing.@@@A total of 293 servicemen and eight civilians were wounded; at least 20 servicemen were captured.@@@There is evidence of cases of torture, the mutilation of captured or already dead servicemen and numerous instances of extrajudicial killings and ill-treatment of Armenian prisoners of war, as well as the humiliating treatment of their bodies.@@@The dead bodies of Armenian female military personnel were mutilated and then proudly video-taped by Azerbaijani servicemen with particular cruelty.@@@The videotapes, featuring such gruesome war crimes and crimes against humanity, are being shared and praised on Azerbaijani social media by individual users.@@@No doubt, committing such unspeakable atrocities is a direct result of a decades-long policy of implanting anti-Armenian hatred and animosity in Azerbaijani society by the political leadership.@@@In the wake of that offensive, the official narrative and other sources of information suggest that Azerbaijan intends to occupy more territories of Armenia, which needs to be prevented.@@@I want to stress that the risk of a new aggression by Azerbaijan remains very high, especially taking into account the fact that every day Azerbaijan violates the ceasefire, and the number of causalities and those injured could change at any moment.@@@Another factor for further escalation may be the inappropriate reaction to this situation by the regional security organizations, which raised very difficult questions among Armenian society.@@@Despite the facts I just mentioned, Azerbaijan is trying to present itself as a country seeking peace in our region and peace with Armenia.@@@Hearing from aside what Azerbaijan is saying, one can even be impressed by its devotion to peace efforts.@@@To stage that impression, Azerbaijan is using the subjects of a peace treaty with Armenia, border delimitation and a regional communication opening agenda.@@@Why have we not made any tangible progress in those directions?@@@The reason is very simple.@@@Azerbaijan is using all those topics for territorial claims against Armenia.@@@For example, one of the most important subjects of a peace treaty is the bilateral recognition of territorial integrity between Armenia and Azerbaijan.@@@We already declared that we were ready to do that, but
so far Azerbaijan has not done so.@@@On the contrary, Azerbaijan has been publicly voicing that the entire south and east of Armenia, and even the capital city of Yerevan, is Azerbaijani land.@@@On the other hand, Azerbaijan is keeping physical territories of Armenia under occupation, and, as I said, the risk of a new aggression by Azerbaijan remains very high.@@@In that regard, I pose an official and public question to the Azerbaijani President.@@@Could he show the map of Armenia that he recognizes, or is ready to recognize, as the Republic of Armenia?@@@Why I am asking that is because it can come out that, from the point of view of official Azerbaijan, only half of Armenia, or even less, is the Republic of Armenia.@@@If Azerbaijan would recognize the territorial integrity of Armenia, not theoretically, but concretely — I mean the integrity of our internationally recognized territory of 29,800 square kilometres — it would mean that we could sign a peace treaty by mutually recognizing each other’s territorial integrity.@@@Otherwise, we will have a phantom peace treaty, and, after that, Azerbaijan will use the border delimitation process for new territorial claims and occupation.@@@As Member States may know, the bilateral commission for border delimitation and border security was formed in May, and two meetings of the commission took place.@@@Before the formation of the commission, last year Azerbaijan occupied more than 40 square kilometres of territory of Armenia.@@@One of Azerbaijan’s excuses for the reasons that it did that was that, according to it, Armenia refuses to form a border delimitation commission.@@@Of course, we did not refuse to do that but insisted only that a border-security mechanism should be simultaneously established.@@@In the end, according to a request by our international partners, who argued that the Border Commission’s work itself would be a reliable factor for border security, we agreed to start the work.@@@But now that the Commission for Border Delimitation and Security has been established and is operational, Azerbaijan has initiated a new phase of aggression, while some of those international partners have been silent.@@@So what is the explanation for Azerbaijan’s aggression now?@@@As everyone knows, if someone is excessively aggressive, there is always a reason.@@@As has been said in a movie, it is always possible to find a reason.@@@Why was Prince Hamlet killed?@@@Who killed him, how, when and why?@@@The reason does not matter.@@@The reality is that Azerbaijan is trying to use the delimitation process for territorial claims against Armenia and will continue to do so.@@@Another related topic is the opening of regional transport communication links.@@@Azerbaijan is trying to portray Armenia as the destructive side in that discussion.@@@The reality is that Armenia is ready to open its roads to Azerbaijan within the framework of our national legislation.@@@The Government also recently published a draft decision proposing to open three checkpoints on the border with Azerbaijan in order to implement article 9 of the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020.@@@According to the draft decision, citizens and goods coming from Azerbaijan would be eligible to use Armenia’s existing roads to commute from Azerbaijan proper to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.@@@The Armenian Government, in a demonstration of political will, was willing to adopt the draft decision unilaterally.@@@But Azerbaijani officials have told us that they do not want those routes.@@@What do they want?@@@They want a new road to be built, which is also acceptable to Armenia.@@@But according to article 9 of the trilateral statement, a new road can be built only with the consent of both sides.@@@Armenia is ready to build that road if its operation is regulated under the legislation and sovereign control of the Republic of Armenia.@@@What therefore is the point of Azerbaijan’s claims?@@@It is hinting that Armenia must provide an extraterritorial corridor, and, according to Azerbaijan, article 9 of the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020 is supposed to support that claim.@@@The statement is a public document, and in article 9 there is no mention of a corridor, extraterritoriality or any related matters.@@@So what is Azerbaijan’s purpose in this?@@@It is to create a new crisis to provide a pretext for a new aggression against Armenia and a new territorial claim.@@@We have shared packages of proposals with Azerbaijan on the topic of opening communications, and if Azerbaijan accepts the fact that those roads must operate in accordance with national legislation, we can decide that very quickly.@@@By the way, the trilateral statements of 9 November 2020 and 11 January 2021 imply not only that Armenia should provide roads to Azerbaijan, but that Azerbaijan should provide roads to Armenia too.@@@And we have received nothing so far.@@@As for the wording about corridors, it is very important to note that in the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020 only one corridor is mentioned, the Lachin corridor for Nagorno Karabakh.@@@One of the crucial factors in the stability of our region is a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh whereby the rights and security of the Armenians living there must be addressed and guaranteed.@@@However, the latest aggression is happening while the humanitarian consequences of the 2020 war in Nagorno Karabakh have yet to be addressed.@@@The post-war rehabilitation of Nagorno Karabakh, the psychosocial issues of the displaced population, the repatriation of Armenian prisoners of war and the preservation of cultural and religious heritage remain on our Government’s agenda.@@@Nevertheless, the Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh are in need of the international community’s support.@@@We call for support for ensuring that United Nations humanitarian agencies have secure and unhindered access to Nagorno Karabakh in order to assess the humanitarian and human rights situation and ensure the protection of cultural heritage on the ground.@@@We believe that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and an independent factfinding mission under the auspices of UNESCO should be granted access to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict zone.@@@Unfortunately, Azerbaijan has been blocking the possibility of a visit by either body by setting artificial, political preconditions, essentially blocking access for an independent fact-finding mission in Nagorno Karabakh.@@@It is also reprehensible that Azerbaijan is stalling the repatriation of Armenian prisoners of war, among other things subjecting them to staged trials in gross violation of international humanitarian law, its own commitments and in contravention of the calls of the international community.@@@Sustainable regional peace and stability are our objective.@@@Last year, through snap democratic elections, our people strongly supported the Government’s peace agenda and reaffirmed Armenia’s commitment to pursuing its democratic path.@@@It is very important to emphasize that Azerbaijan’s attacks target not only Armenia’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity but its democracy as well.@@@Despite the expectations of certain forces, in the wake of the devastating war of 2020 Armenia has remained democratic, using free, fair and democratic elections as a way to avoid an internal political crisis, a fact that the international community has unanimously recognized and praised.@@@Armenia’s democracy is struggling in an atmosphere in which Azerbaijan is using force every day to unilaterally impose its plans to put an end to our statehood, independence and democracy.@@@But I am here to announce that we are determined to defend our democracy, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity by every possible means.@@@I want to underscore that diplomatic solutions are an absolute priority for us and that the international community’s full engagement and support are crucial.@@@In that regard, I would like to mention that an international observation mission to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border areas would be an important factor in achieving regional stability.@@@There can be no question that in the interests of regional stability and in accordance with the norms and principles of international law, Azerbaijan’s military forces must be withdrawn from the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia.@@@I want to stress once again that we are determined to build peace in our region, but we need the full support of the international community in standing by our sovereign and democratic country and people, who have been subjected to aggression that goes against the norms and principles of international law.@@@I believe in the possibility that we can establish long-term stability, security and peace, and Armenia is committed to continuing diplomatic efforts to that end.@@@At the outset, I would like to discharge the pleasant duty of sharing with the General Assembly the warm greetings of the Malian people, who are rich in cultural, religious and ethnic diversity, as well as those of His Excellency Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State.@@@The election of Mr. Csaba Korosi to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and the conclusion of the work of the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly skilfully led by his predecessor Mr. Abdulla Shahid of the Republic of Maldives give me the happy opportunity to extend to them the warm congratulations of all of Mali.@@@Allow me also to reiterate to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, our great appreciation for the commendable efforts he continues to make towards the realization of the noble objectives of our shared Organization.@@@We are convinced that he is a friend of Mali and the Sahel.@@@Since friendship is based on sincerity, I would like to express my profound disagreement with his recent media appearance, during which he took a position and spoke on the case involving the 46 Ivorian mercenaries, which is a bilateral and judicial matter between two brotherly countries.@@@It is obvious that the legal character of the offences arising from this case does not fall within the remit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.@@@In Mali, our Administration does not work on the basis of oral proceedings or press statements, and, accordingly, we scrupulously adhere to the note verbale issued by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), contained in document MINUSMA/PROT/ NV/226/2022 of 22 July 2022, in which it is clear that there are no links between the 46 mercenaries and the United Nations.@@@The recent alignment of actions and harmonization of terms intended to change the status of my country, Mali, from victim to culprit in this affair involving mercenaries, are obviously without effect.@@@As the Secretary-General’s position on the matter has been adopted by certain West African leaders, it is through him that we would send them messages.@@@For example, to the current Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mr. Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who said,
“We have just seen the day before yesterday the
statement of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, who said that they are not mercenaries.@@@If I were the Malians, I would have released these
49 soldiers”,
I would like to respectfully point out that while there is a principle of subsidiarity between ECOWAS and the United Nations, it is not clear cut, nor is it mimicry.@@@It is also important to point out that the Secretary- General of the United Nations is not a Head of State, and that the Chair of ECOWAS is not a civil servant.@@@It would therefore be appropriate for Mr. Guterres not to trivialize ECOWAS.@@@Finally, it would be useful to remind the Chair of ECOWAS that in Mali, the authorities do not interfere in judicial matters and that they respect the independence of the judiciary.@@@It is not our role, therefore, to arrest or release people, which is a judicial function.@@@In addition, Mr. Umaro Sissoco Embalo should be aware of the fact that he is the custodian of a daunting legacy and the numerous sacrifices that have made the reputation of ECOWAS.@@@The momentum that has made the organization great must remain unbroken.@@@Furthermore, we have noted the threat of sanctions against Mali, and, far from being afraid of sanctions, I would point out to the Chair of ECOWAS that, at the end of his term of office, the peoples of West Africa will judge him on the efforts he will have made to improve their living conditions, and not on the media shows that serve foreign agendas.@@@As to Mr. Bazoum, he should take note that the Malian transition Government did not react to his insulting remarks for two reasons.@@@The first reason is the respect we have for the teaching of our ancestors that holds that one should not respond to insults with insults.@@@The second reason is related to the identity of Mr. Bazoum, a foreigner who claims to be from the Niger.@@@Because we know that the brotherly people of the Niger are distinguished by their very rich societal, cultural and religious values, Mr. Bazoum cannot be from the Niger; his behaviour makes us feel completely comfortable with this observation.@@@Mali will draw all legal consequences from the actions of the Secretary- General.@@@We ask those who wish to refute our version to state, before God and on their soul and conscience, whether they would find it acceptable that military personnel who have concealed their identities by putting in their passports that they are painters, masons or the like disembark at their airports with weapons, without informing them in advance, and with the fateful intention of destabilizing their countries.@@@If they as States do not find this acceptable, if it cannot be done in Lisbon or anywhere else, Mali as a State will not find its acceptable either, be it in Bamako or any other Malian locality.@@@The theme of this seventy-seventh ordinary session of the General Assembly — a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges — will give hope for better days for Mali, provided that an uncompromising assessment of the previous era is made, lessons learned and objective recommendations made.@@@Once these steps are taken, I have no doubt that through our collective action we will succeed not only in calming the multiple sources of tension in the world, but also in promoting harmonious development and effectively fighting against pandemics, environmental degradation and global
warming, inequalities and policies of domination and resource pillaging.@@@Since August 2020, my country, Mali, has been in a transition process, which will end on 26 March 2024, with the transfer of power to elected authorities.@@@Between today and that date, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Assises nationales de la refondation, the transitional authorities have, in two timetables agreed with ECOWAS, committed themselves to carrying out political and institutional reforms, before organizing elections, the ultimate objective of which is to rebuild the Malian State, so that it can respond to the deep and legitimate aspirations of our people for peace, security, good governance, development and lasting institutional stability in Mali.@@@With this perspective in mind, I am happy to point out that some major advances have already been made, in particular the promulgation of the electoral law, which includes, inter alia, the creation of the Independent Election Management Authority, whose establishment is at an advanced stage, as well as the setting up of a commission composed of eminent personalities from all components of Malian society, to be responsible for drafting the new Constitution.@@@On another level, few people know that Mali is the only country in the world in which there are four overlapping types of insecurity that occur simultaneously:	terrorism, community conflicts
manipulated by terrorists and their foreign-State sponsors, transnational organized crime, and the violent actions of isolated individuals.@@@In parallel with the process of returning to constitutional order, Mali continues to wage a merciless struggle against the actors of insecurity, in particular extremist groups that are responsible for all sorts of abuses against our peaceful populations.@@@With respect to Mali, I am happy and proud to announce that the terrorist groups have been seriously weakened, and fear has even changed sides.@@@However, these criminal groups retain a certain capacity to cause harm in their desperate attempts to undermine our territorial integrity and terrorize our populations.@@@Mali’s valiant defence and security forces remain determined to confront all threats from wherever they may come.@@@Under the leadership of His Excellency Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State, the Government of Mali continues to intensify its efforts to recruit, train, equip and strengthen the operational capacities of the Malian defence and security forces.@@@In this regard, I must say that the offensive actions carried out so far have enabled our forces to win decisive victories against the obscurantist forces.@@@They have also enabled the State to regain its foothold in and reassert its authority over a large part of the national territory, as well as to encourage the return of several thousand of our compatriots to their places of origin.@@@However, we know that a purely military or security solution has its limits.@@@That is why, in support of military action, the Government of Mali has adopted a comprehensive and integrated strategy that comprises political, social and development measures, including the provision of basic social services to our populations hard hit by the multifaceted crisis we have been experiencing since January 2012, with the objective of restoring the authority of the State throughout the national territory.@@@In this context, the Government of Mali approved the national strategy for the stabilization of the central regions and its 2022- 2024 action plan on 24 August.@@@This strategy reflects the desire of the transitional authorities to have a holistic approach to stabilizing the central regions.@@@It aims to make the centre a stable and prosperous area where communities are reconciled and live in harmony with their neighbours.@@@At the same time, the diligent and intelligent implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, which came out of the Algiers process, remains a strategic priority for the transitional authorities, as a peaceful instrument for a lasting resolution of the crisis that Mali is experiencing in its northern part.@@@I must say that I am particularly pleased with the outcome of the second decision-level meeting of the parties to the Agreement, held in Bamako from 1 to 5 August 2022.@@@This important meeting, which brought together the signatory parties and international mediators, made it possible to remove certain obstacles to the relaunch of the Agreement implementation process.@@@Continuing this positive and progressive momentum in the peace process, the sixth high-level meeting of the Agreement Monitoring Committee was held in Bamako just a few weeks ago, on 2 September 2022.@@@This session of the Monitoring Committee sent a strong signal of the parties’ willingness to engage in a new dynamic to complete the implementation of the Agreement.@@@I would like to reaffirm our commitment to this process, the success of which remains one of the sine qua non conditions for lasting stability in Mali.@@@This is the right time for me to thank Algeria once again for playing an active role in the peace process and to thank the international mediation team for its support.@@@I am not forgetting the situation of Malian refugees in neighbouring countries, which I thank in passing for their hospitality towards our people.@@@Nor am I forgetting the situation of our internally displaced compatriots.@@@I want to reassure them that the Government of Mali remains very attentive to their precarious situation and that all our efforts are aimed at creating the conditions for their return home in safety and dignity, with a view to their effective participation in the life of the nation.@@@In its difficult quest for peace, stability and sustainable development, the Malian people remain grateful for the efforts and sacrifices made by MINUSMA, from its creation in July 2013 to the present day, aimed at helping Mali restore its authority throughout its territory.@@@That is why I would like to pay tribute, on behalf of the people and the Government of Mali, to the memory of all the victims, Malian and foreign, civilian and military, who have fallen on the field of honour in the country.@@@Nevertheless, we must recognize that almost 10 years after the establishment of the Mission, the objectives for which MINUSMA was deployed in Mali have not been achieved, and this, despite numerous resolutions of the Security Council.@@@That is why the Government of Mali reiterates its often-expressed request for a change of paradigm: for MINUSMA to adapt to the environment in which it is deployed, and for it to be better coordinated with the Malian authorities.@@@From this perspective, it is extremely important for MINUSMA to remain a support force for Mali in its quest for stability.@@@The Government of Mali denounces negative external influences and attempts to use certain entities legally present in the country to serve hidden agendas, including through the exploitation of the human rights issue for destabilization purposes.@@@The world will remember that Mali, after being abandoned midstream, on 10 June 2021, by France, which decided unilaterally to withdraw the Barkhane force from my country, was then stabbed in the back by the French authorities.@@@This clarification is all the more useful since we refuse to confuse the French people, whom we respect, with their leaders.@@@The French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism.@@@I repeat: the French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism.@@@I repeat one last time: the French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism.@@@The obscurantism of the French junta stems from its nostalgia for condescending, paternalistic and revanchist neo-colonial practices, including ordering the premeditated, unprecedented, illegal, illegitimate and inhuman sanctions against my country adopted by ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union.@@@After more than 10 years of insecurity resulting in thousands of deaths, refugees and internally displaced persons, is it not a sacrilege to put a Malian population that is a victim of insecurity in a landlocked country under embargo for seven months by closing the borders and seizing Mali’s financial accounts?@@@Thanks to their resilience and the solidarity of friendly countries and peoples of Africa, the Malian people have held out and thwarted the predictions of their adversaries.@@@The obscurantism of the French junta, which has so quickly forgotten its responsibility for the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, has led to its guilt for instrumentalizing ethnic differences, and to it desperately trying to separate Malian children from each other and their families.@@@Finally, this obscurantism of the French junta has caused it to violate Malian airspace by flying drones, military helicopters and fighter jets more than 50 times over that airspace, providing intelligence, weapons and ammunition to terrorist groups.@@@In order to ease its conscience, the French junta accuses Mali of being ungrateful for various counterterrorism operations, and revelling in the regrettable deaths of 59 French soldiers in Mali.@@@In response to this sad accusation, we recall that in most of the official Malian statements and ceremonies, we systematically pay homage to all victims of insecurity in Mali, including the 59 deceased French soldiers, without making distinctions by nationality.@@@Further, we invite the French not to stop there, but to take a look back at their history: their intervention in Libya decried
by all Africa, the forced participation of thousands of Africans in the First and Second World Wars, not to mention the slave trade, which explains the economic rise of many countries.@@@How many Africans have died for France and the free world in which we live?@@@In view of serious acts committed by the French junta, Mali, in a letter dated 15 August 2022 (S/2022/622), requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council.@@@The purpose of this meeting would be to allow my country to present the evidence it has gathered, which shows that the French army has repeatedly and frequently attacked Mali, violating its airspace without authorization from the authorities and sometimes falsified flight documents.@@@More seriously, Mali will be able to prove that the French junta has provided intelligence and weapons to terrorist groups.@@@The Government of Mali wonders why this member of the Security Council, which currently holds the Council presidency, is blocking a debate that would establish the truth.@@@The world needs to be informed about the serious events that have taken place in Mali, which are at the root of the worsening insecurity and destabilization of Mali and the Sahel.@@@By referring the matter to the Security Council, the Government of Mali intends to make this important body, which is endowed with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, face up to its responsibilities and denounce the French junta’s actions against my country.@@@These hostile acts are incompatible with the United Nations Charter and with France’s status as a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@The credibility of the mechanisms of our shared Organization is it stake, as is the effectiveness of its fight against terrorism.@@@But more importantly, the integrity of the United Nations, which is based on respect for international commitments, international legality and the United Nations Charter, inter alia, is at risk.@@@It seems appropriate for Mali to request the personal involvement of the President of the General Assembly in calling upon the Security Council to grant our request, so that the duplicity and the proxy war imposed on my country may cease.@@@In its fight against terrorism and violent extremism, the Government of Mali has been confronted with difficult challenges in terms of human rights.@@@I would like to emphasize that human rights are, more than any other, a value that every Malian embodies.@@@The Government of Mali remains determined to respect human rights and ensure that human rights are respected, in accordance with its zero-tolerance policy against impunity.@@@We adhere to this out of loyalty to our ancestral values enshrined in the 1236 Kouroukan Fouga Charter of Emperor Soundiata Keita.@@@As a cradle of great civilizations, heir to great empires, a melting- pot land of hospitality and tolerance, Mali makes the promotion and defence of human rights a national priority, which is why I strongly reaffirm that the military operations of the Malian defence and security forces are conducted in strict compliance with human rights and international humanitarian law.@@@However, as I have just emphasized, the Government of Mali is vehemently opposed to the use of the issue of human rights for political purposes or posturing or blackmail or intimidation.@@@Similarly, we regret the double standards that lead to the rights of populations whose entire villages have been massacred and razed hardly arousing any indignation, while communications are manipulated to pass off terrorists neutralized on the battlefield as innocent civilians.@@@In conclusion, I will say that the Malian people have decided to take their destiny into their own hands.@@@They fully support the Government in rebuilding Mali and returning it to peaceful and secure constitutional order in March 2024, after free, transparent and credible elections.@@@The realization of these vast projects requires the Government to extend and intensify its efforts aimed at continuously improving the security situation in the country and protecting the people and their property.@@@In this regard, I am pleased that the third Transition Support Group Meeting on Mali was held in Lome on 6 September.@@@I am also pleased with this important meeting’s outcomes, in particular the recognition of the progress made by the transition authorities, the calls for the mobilization of all Mali’s partners to consolidate their political, economic, technical and financial support to the Republic of Mali, and the support voiced for the efforts of Mali’s transitional authorities to achieve a harmonious return to constitutional order.@@@I would like to remind the Assembly that the transition in Mali came as the result of several years of dysfunction in our young democracy, which nevertheless had achieved some positive results.@@@Unfortunately, on balance, our liabilities were greater than our assets, which is what triggered the transition.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank our respected elder, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic of Cote d’Ivoire, for the wise and enlightened advice he gave us in his memorable address to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session (see A/77/PV.7).@@@I would like to reassure him that the Malian transitional authorities have no other objective than to carry out political and institutional reforms before organizing elections, while doggedly fighting terrorism.@@@These reforms will improve governance, and all measures will be taken to make Mali’s democracy the most envied in the world.@@@In those efforts, we will pay particular attention to the issue of the “third term”, which will be excluded as a possibility in our country.@@@The “third term”, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept, consists of the president of a republic carrying out a four-step manoeuvre to retain power for himself and his clan.@@@It works as follows.@@@The first stage occurs near the end of a president’s second term.@@@Because term limits make him ineligible for re-election, the outgoing president calls for a constitutional revision in a non-consensual manner.@@@In the second stage, that of constitutional revision, the outgoing president modifies some constitutional provisions.@@@In the third stage, once the new Constitution has been adopted — against the background of a political crisis, of course — the outgoing president now becomes a candidate, in violation of the two-term limit.@@@His candidacy is now justified by the adoption of the new Constitution under the obvious pretext that the two-term limit was contained in the old Constitution, while the outgoing president is a candidate under the newly adopted Constitution.@@@The fourth stage involves the organization of elections, which are a farce.@@@Naturally, the outgoing president wins the election.@@@A ruthless hunt for political opponents ensues.@@@Some of them are arrested, others go into exile and still others are murdered.@@@Allegiances are won through the power of money, patronage and intimidation.@@@I would simply state, using a soccer metaphor, that the third term is a magic trick: it is the art of dribbling past one’s opponents while keeping the ball.@@@President Ouattara’s advice reminds us of the sad story of the camel mocking the hump of the dromedary.@@@Despite the tangible efforts of the Malian transition to implement the timetables for the political and institutional reforms and elections that have been hailed by the international community, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French junta, from whom Mali has not asked for a single thing, considered there to have been no progress, forgetting that no one can love Mali more than the Malians themselves.@@@Her singular position, adverse to us, hardly surprises us.@@@Victor Hugo in “Claude Gueux” classified the human race into two categories:
“There are men who are metal, and there are men
who are lodestones.”@@@The Minister in question, unfortunately, is neither metal nor lodestone; she is hideously sui generis.@@@Faced with uncertainty and strange situations, the Malian people adopt an attitude of prudence.@@@In The Strange Fate of Wangrin, writer and sage Amadou Hampate Ba advised that:
“If the ability to observe is a quality, knowing how
to be silent can save a person from calamity”.@@@Mali advises the Minister of the French junta to be content with simply observing her situation.@@@This is an opportunity for me to salute the exemplary and fruitful cooperative relations Mali has with Russia, while reaffirming that Mali remains open to all partners that wish to help it meet the multiple challenges besetting it, in strict respect for its sovereignty and unity and of the dignity of the Malian people.@@@Mali recalls that, in line with the vision of Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State, three principles guide national public action: first, respect for the sovereignty of Mali; secondly, respect for the strategic choices and partners of Mali; and thirdly, consideration of the vital interests of the Malian people in the decisions taken.@@@In implementing those principles, Mali remains willing to pursue and strengthen its good-neighbourly relations with all the countries around it.@@@Similarly, faithful to its pan-African commitment, Mali will continue to work within subregional and regional organizations to bring about African integration.@@@Also, achieving the objectives of the transition requires the support of all Mali’s partners, including the United Nations.@@@I therefore appeal to Mali’s friends to stand by the Government in order to help it to meet those important challenges together.@@@As for the vast majority of the world’s States, convinced by mutual respect and the win-win partnership, I guarantee that Mali’s doors are wide open to them, and Malians will welcome them with open arms.@@@For the minority that may be tempted not to respect those principles, we promise them that they will be met by millions of Assimi Goita supporters, anxious to preserve their honour, their dignity and their vital interests.@@@I will conclude by giving two pieces of advice to those that are nostalgic for domination.@@@They should have a sense of empathy by treating others as they would like to be treated and not doing to others what they would not want done to them.@@@The second piece of advice is to review their work, revise their models, adjust their mindsets to reflect the change in attitudes and the evolution of the world into their assessment and analysis grids, move on from the colonial past, hear the anger, frustration and opposition coming from African cities and rural areas and African peoples and understand that that trend is inevitable.@@@Thanks to the principle of fractional multiplication, their intimidation and disruptive actions have only swelled the ranks of Africans anxious to preserve their dignity.@@@If there were only 100 of us at independence, today there are millions, and tomorrow, as long as the unequal patterns remain, there will be billions.@@@Mali and its people will not be bystanders in the face of attacks and adversity.@@@For every word used wrongly, we will respond by reciprocating; for every bullet fired against us, we will respond by reciprocating.@@@Only then will a new era become a reality, with solutions that bring about change to address interrelated challenges through interdependent States and by valuing humankind, without distinction of any kind, in particular with regard to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as stipulated in article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@May God bless Mali and protect Malians from the dark and destructive forces of the world.@@@May God bless Africa and protect Africans from the obscurantist and destructive forces of the world.@@@May God bless the world and protect all humankind from the dark and destructive forces of the world.@@@I congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of Uganda’s full support.@@@I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his stewardship of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@I pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his commitment to the work of the United Nations.@@@The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held in person for the first time since 2020, when the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic made it impossible to do so.@@@It is a timely reminder of the urgent need to strengthen international cooperation, collaboration and solidarity so that the world may take transformative actions to address the common challenges that include, inter alia, poverty, health, pandemics, climate change, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.@@@As we celebrate 77 years of the United Nations, we need a revitalized Organization that is fit for purpose.@@@We need our Organization to be stronger than ever before.@@@We believe that multilateralism is fundamental and crucial in addressing our common challenges.@@@We believe that, by acting together in solidarity as nations, the world can effectively address the current and emerging challenges.@@@Responding to COVID-19 has taught us a lot.@@@We should scale up cooperation in vaccine production capacity and resource mobilization in order to support efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@We are thankful to our bilateral and multilateral partners that supported our response to the COVID-19 challenge.@@@The Government of Uganda attaches importance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and continues to register progress in its implementation.@@@It has continued to strengthen its institutional coordination to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and its national SDG secretariat has been strengthened to support the coordination architecture in order to ensure that the country stays on track in implementing the SDGs.@@@The Government of Uganda has fully mainstreamed the SDGs in its national development plan and is working together with the United Nations family and other stakeholders.@@@That will sustain and strengthen collaboration with all actors.@@@However, the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda will require support in areas such as transfer of technology, capacity-building and financing.@@@Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time.@@@Our collective effort to fight climate change is an irreversible process that must continue.@@@However, we must note that, despite contributing an insignificant amount of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the African continent, like many developing regions of the world, suffers the effects of climate change to a disproportionate degree.@@@Uganda, for instance, continues to experience prolonged droughts and the melting of ice caps on its highest mountain, Mount Rwenzori, as well as floods, erratic rainfall patterns and landslides.@@@Moreover, as His Excellency President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has said before, the climate change problem is also the result of irresponsible and sometimes greedy human actions.@@@Similarly, if underdevelopment persists, we can forget about conserving the environment.@@@It is regrettable and hypocritical that some of the regions and nations that mismanaged the environment and are disproportionately responsible for global warming have embarked on a rigorous campaign to thwart the efforts of other countries to responsibly and sustainably develop their oil and gas sectors.@@@Our view is that development should be environmentally friendly, inclusive and provide benefits for all — it should leave no one behind.@@@Uganda has continued to scale up investments in climate adaptation and mitigation measures, specifically with regard to increasing access to clean energy in
order to enhance production, as well as increasing forest and wetland cover, among other interventions.@@@Climate change action must uphold the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and be consistent with a country’s national context.@@@We therefore urge developed countries to fully deliver, in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, on the commitments to the goal of providing $100 billion per year to assist developing countries in the climate change actions they take to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.@@@South-South cooperation, a framework of international cooperation within the global South, continues to play a vital role in supporting developing countries in their efforts to address interlocking challenges.@@@We applaud the countries of the global South for their solidarity in responding to global challenges.@@@Uganda will continue to work towards and support the strengthening of North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation at the United Nations.@@@As host country of the third South Summit, to be held in Kampala from 10 to 12 December 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the Group of 77 and China.@@@The world currently faces many challenges that undermine international peace and security.@@@The Russia-Ukraine military conflict continues to cause more suffering, destruction and displacement of the civilian population, mostly women and children.@@@The longer it persists, the more suffering, destruction and displacement we will witness.@@@We are deeply concerned about the loss of life and the serious humanitarian situation.@@@Uganda supports dialogue with a view to reaching a peaceful resolution to the crisis.@@@My President has said many times that,
“We think the best way is to negotiate.@@@Everybody
who wants peace in the world should support
negotiations in order to get a balanced peace that
ensures safety for all.”@@@Terrorism is currently one of the major global threats to peace, security, stability and social and economic development.@@@No region of the world has been safe from the scourge of terrorism.@@@Terrorism and violent extremism continue to bring death and suffering to innocent people.@@@Terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab and the Allied Democratic Forces continue to commit terrorist acts in our region.@@@As a community of nations, we must be unwavering in our resolve to prevent and combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.@@@We should act in a coordinated manner at the national, regional and global levels to counter that threat.@@@Uganda will continue to support and actively participate in global and regional counterterrorism efforts.@@@Peace, security and development are inextricably linked and should be pursued simultaneously.@@@Recently, we have seen some progress in our quest for peace and security in our region.@@@Uganda, working with partners in the region and beyond, continues to support and advance peace and security efforts in the region.@@@We remain actively involved in regional initiatives, such as those of the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the East African Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and we are encouraged by the progress that we have made and continue to make.@@@We believe that long-term and sustainable solutions lie in those collaborative processes.@@@The international community, in particular the United Nations, should therefore continue to support conflict-prevention initiatives undertaken by those regional and subregional organizations.@@@Experience has shown that, when and where that has happened, the chances of success have been high.@@@The conflicts in our region and beyond have led to an inevitable refugee influx into Uganda.@@@Currently, we have more than 1.5 million refugees in the country — the largest refugee population on the continent of Africa and the third-largest in the world.@@@We are committed to working with refugee-sending countries and regional and international partners to address the causes of the refugee crisis.@@@We urge the international community to continue supporting our efforts in the region in that direction.@@@The need to reform the Security Council is now more urgent and imperative than ever before.@@@The current geopolitical realities make an increasingly compelling case for a comprehensive reform of the Council to make way for equitable representation.@@@Africa, which has more than 1 billion citizens and accounts for more than 70 per cent of the issues on the agenda of the Council, continues to suffer the historical injustice of having no representation in the permanent category of Security Council membership — and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category.@@@It is time for the long-standing injustice and imbalance perpetuated in the current configuration of the Security Council to be addressed.@@@Uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the Council and urges Member States to continue working towards achieving progress in the
intergovernmental negotiations so that Africa can assume its rightful place in the Security Council.@@@The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM) remains a strong pillar in addressing global challenges within the United Nations.@@@We remain actively involved in NAM, in line with its purposes and principles.@@@In that regard, Uganda will continue to collectively work with other NAM countries to further strengthen the critical role of the Movement at the United Nations.@@@As host of the nineteenth NAM Summit, to be held in Kampala from 5 to 9 December 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement.@@@It is a great honour to take the floor in this majestic Hall of multilateral diplomacy on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Joao Manuel Gongalves Lourengo, President of the Republic of Angola, who wished to be here in person to address the Assembly but was unable to do so, owing to the general elections of 24 August and to his swearing-in ceremony.@@@However, His Excellency the President has entrusted me to greet all those present, especially His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, and to congratulate him on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of the support of the Republic of Angola during his presidency.@@@This session, held under the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is taking place at a unique and sensitive international moment in our modern history, where we face complex challenges that call for joint solutions.@@@The world faces persistent and cyclical challenges, which have been exacerbated in recent years by the international health situation brought about by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the emergence of growing threats to the economy, peace and global security, and the impacts of climate change.@@@The Republic of Angola has championed at international forums the importance of multilateralism and international cooperation, which are mutually advantageous and beneficial to relations between States, be they large or small, developed or developing, because in our understanding that is how we can effectively contribute to the search for consensus solutions in resolving political, economic, social and cultural crises.@@@World peace, which we all aim to achieve, will come about only through peacebuilding efforts in every country.@@@In that regard, the Republic of Angola continues to make important efforts to contribute to peace and stability on the African continent and in its subregion in particular.@@@In its role presiding over the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Republic of Angola has spared no effort to contribute to peace and stability in the region, especially with respect to the conflict in the Central African Republic, but also with regard to the border dispute between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as between Uganda and Rwanda, where we have modestly tried to do our best, since, as we know, the solution always and above all depends on the political will of the parties directly involved, as His Excellency the President of the Republic of Angola, Mr. Joao Manuel Gongalves Lourengo, recently reminded us.@@@Angola’s peacebuilding efforts on the African continent have earned it the special recognition of the African Union, which designated the President of the Republic of Angola, Mr. Joao Manuel Gongalves
Lourengo, an African Union Champion for Peace and Reconciliation at the Extraordinary Session of the African Union Assembly on terrorism and unconstitutional changes of Governments in Africa, which demonstrates our country’s commitment to mediation and consensus in resolving political crises in Africa and around the world.@@@Those efforts have been galvanized by the support we have received from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.@@@Angola will continue to work closely with the United Nations and the African Union in peacebuilding and consensus-building efforts in order to resolve conflicts, with a view to achieving a culture of peace, security and stability, in the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of Central African States and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, as well as in the Gulf of Guinea Commission and other regional organizations.@@@The Republic of Angola continues to uphold the inalienable rights of all States to strengthen their own defence capabilities against external threats, equipping their armed forces with personnel, weapons and equipment that meet national needs.@@@In that regard, we reiterate here our call for the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the Central African Republic.@@@History has taught us that we must discourage the use of force to resolve conflicts between sovereign nations, as the consequences for humankind are immeasurable.@@@Based on the principle of non-alignment enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Angola, our country advocates for conflict resolution through dialogue and respect for international law.@@@The political-military conflicts and the existing and persistent disparities in the economic and technological development spheres among world regions and geographic blocs represent a permanent threat and, at the same time, an opportunity for all humankind to join forces for their peaceful resolution.@@@Angola once again urges the end of the economic embargo against Cuba and the removal of unilateral measures and sanctions against the Cuban people, which impede their country’s harmonious economic, social and technical-scientific development.@@@In general, Angola favours the lifting of all unilateral sanctions or coercive measures imposed against the peoples of Zimbabwe and Venezuela, among others, without a mandate from the Security Council.@@@Such politically motivated measures have proven to be counterproductive to efforts to eradicate poverty and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, and violate the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international public and humanitarian law.@@@Negotiations for reforming the Security Council still have not produced the results that the overwhelming majority of Member States expects.@@@The Republic of Angola joins other voices in championing such reform towards an equitable representation that reflects the current configuration of the United Nations.@@@The Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration represent a viable option for restoring the rights and legitimate aspirations of the African continent and correcting the historical injustices that the region is experiencing with its absence from the decision-making centre of one of the main statutory bodies in matters of international peace and security created by the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Angola held its fifth general elections on 24 August characterized by an environment of peace, harmony and transparency, thereby consolidating the construction of a democratic State and the rule of law with a view towards the country’s socioeconomic development.@@@The newly elected Government intends to continue to work on ongoing reforms as one of the priorities of its mandate.@@@The Republic of Angola is aligned with the international consensus on sustainable development, including the African Union’s Agenda 2063 on the environment.@@@It has approved a national strategy on climate change and environmental education and plans to achieve the target of 70 per cent energy from non-polluting sources by 2025, favouring clean hydroelectric and solar energy.@@@To that end, many substantial investments have been made in economic and social infrastructure in order to mitigate the effects of the prolonged drought that has affected the southern region of Angola, with special emphasis on the inauguration in 2022 of an aqueduct in the province of Cunene, which will provide access to water for 350,000 citizens over a span of 160 kilometres, ensuring a water supply for people, cattle and irrigation.@@@In conclusion, I would like to announce that the Republic of Angola will host the tenth summit of the Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) in Luanda from 6 to 10 December 2022, at a time when the challenges that the international community faces are increasingly complex and require the engagement and solidarity of everyone in order to overcome them.@@@Our purpose in convening the summit is to spare no effort to ensure that the OACPS, which is now a full-fledged international organization, can play its role in the concert of nations.@@@Therefore, we hope we can count on the attendance and participation of all OACPS member States.@@@I wish to congratulate the brotherly nation of Hungary on the election of its representative, Mr. Csaba Korosi, as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish you every success in this important international position, Mr. President, and the Kyrgyz Republic stands ready to support you.@@@At the same time, I wish to thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid, the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his hard work during difficult times for the world community, as well as for supporting the international initiatives of my country.@@@The United Nations was established 77 years ago after the worst world war in the history of humankind.@@@Perhaps the founding States of the United Nations, which signed the international agreement to establish the Organization in San Francisco in 1945, naively believed that wars, destruction, hunger and suffering would end forever.@@@I do not think so.@@@Success can always be achieved if there is a mutual understanding that disputes and disagreements must be resolved in a spirit of good faith and compromise.@@@In the history of the United Nations, there have been many important victories and successes.@@@Although conflicts occur with varying degrees of severity in different regions of the world, the United Nations has played an important unifying role as a moral authority in maintaining peace and security and providing for people’s wants and needs.@@@Now, with an unprecedented complication in the global geopolitical environment that has created alarming expectations in the international community due to the threat of the destruction of the fundamental foundations of peaceful coexistence and the inevitability of a major war, it is important for all of us to remember the high goals and objectives set down in the Charter of the United Nations, namely, to maintain international peace and security.@@@To that end, we must take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace; bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, the adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations that might lead to a breach of the peace; and develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of the equal rights and self- determination of peoples.@@@Ever since our country became a State, we have consistently and strictly followed the United Nations Charter and have been fulfilling our duties in good faith.@@@This March marked exactly 30 years since our country joined the United Nations, and recently, on 31 August, we celebrated the thirty-first anniversary of the independence of the Kyrgyz Republic.@@@We always strive to resolve our international disputes by peaceful means.@@@In international relations, we always refrain from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.@@@Looking back at the thorny path walked by our country, we highly appreciate the multifaceted contribution of the United Nations to the formation of Kyrgyzstan as an independent and sovereign State, and an equal and responsible member of the international community.@@@Our people will never forget the support and assistance of the United Nations family in the formation of political, public and civil institutions, the strengthening of democracy and the development of a market economy.@@@On behalf of our generous people and on my own behalf, I express my gratitude to all the leaders and staff of the United Nations system, who sincerely and selflessly helped us to realize the centuries-old dream of the Kyrgyz people to create their own independent State.@@@To them, we extend our gratitude.@@@I take this opportunity to present to the international community from this rostrum the latest developments at the southern borders of our country, in relation to the aggravation of the situation at the Kyrgyz-Tajik border.@@@First, let me briefly touch on the history.@@@The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 paved the way for territorial disputes and border problems, some of which have not been regulated to this day.@@@While there were more than 20 disputed areas along the entire perimeter of the Soviet-Chinese border, five of them were in Kyrgyzstan.@@@I want to proudly remind the international community that we have successfully finalized border- regulation issues, first with the People’s Republic of China in 1996 and jointly with the Republic of Kazakhstan at the point of intersection of the State borders of the three countries in 1999, and subsequently with the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2017.@@@We have now practically completed our joint work and are about to sign an agreement on the State border with the Republic of Uzbekistan.@@@I am pleased to note that the State borders with these three neighbouring countries have become borders of peace, good-neighbourliness, friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation.@@@With regard to relations with the Republic of Tajikistan, I would like to note the following.@@@Our two close, neighbouring peoples have been living side by side for a long time.@@@We are united by common values, culture, traditions and customs.@@@We share the same faith.@@@Our peoples are connected by family ties.@@@Our legendary father Manas was married to the Tajik princess Kanykey.@@@I also recall that, legally, the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred on 21 December 1991 in the city of Alma-Ata, Republic of Kazakhstan, when the heads of 11 newly independent States adopted the Alma-Ata Declaration on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).@@@The declaration stated that our independent States recognize and respect each other’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of existing borders.@@@They indicate that the strengthening of relations of friendship, good-neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperation, which have deep historical roots, meets the fundamental interests of the people and serves the cause of peace and security.@@@It is written that the countries recognize their responsibility to maintain civil peace and international harmony.@@@That legal document was signed by all 11 Presidents of the CIS member States, including the Republic of Tajikistan.@@@The aforementioned principle was confirmed by the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, in the declaration on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and immunity of borders of the State Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States, dated 15 April 1994.@@@He signed and agreed.@@@It is a pity that he is deviating from that principle now.@@@He made his first official visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1998 after the end of the bloody civil war in Tajikistan.@@@Later, two bilateral inter-State agreements were concluded between the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan: the Agreement on bases of the inter-State relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and Republic of Tajikistan of 12 July 1996 and the Agreement on Good Neighbourly and Partnership Relations of 26 May 2004.@@@I want to note that both agreements were signed in Dushanbe.@@@From the very beginning of work on the settlement of border issues between our two States, the Kyrgyz side has always acted in full compliance with its international obligations, including bilateral ones, and conducted negotiations in a constructive manner, offering mutually beneficial compromises.@@@I note that in April 2021, the armed forces of Tajikistan launched an unjustified and unprovoked large-scale aggression on our territory, killing 36 citizens and causing serious material damage.@@@Although my decision to meet with the President of the Republic of Tajikistan in Dushanbe was heavily criticized by the Kyrgyz people —who
demanded that we meet at a neutral location — I flew to Dushanbe and met with President Rahmon in June 2021 to try and find mutually beneficial solutions to the border issues.@@@For the sake of my people, I am ready to spend not only 10 hours on negotiations, as I did that day, but as much time as possible to resolve this issue once and for all.@@@Of course, whatever the solution is, it should be mutually beneficial.@@@It is all the more painful for me to report that on 14, 15 and 16 September, large-scale military clashes took place in the south of Kyrgyzstan.@@@Despite all previously negotiated agreements, the Tajik side, with ill intention, attacked border and civilian objects along the entire perimeter of the Kyrgyz-Tajik State border.@@@About 140,000 of our civilians have been evacuated from border settlements.@@@They are now being provided with the necessary assistance.@@@In that regard, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the United Nations system, our friends and partners for their solidarity and support.@@@Great material damage was caused to civilian and military facilities, including houses, administrative buildings, schools and frontier posts.@@@Any material damage can be restored.@@@However, we cannot restore the lives of our citizens who were fired upon or those of the brave defenders who sacrificed their lives and died fighting for their homeland.@@@We will never forget the bravery of our courageous soldiers.@@@We are deeply saddened by the unjustified armed aggressions by Tajikistan, despite international agreements and obligations established between our countries.@@@Pacta sunt servanda is the Latin for “agreements must be kept”.@@@We are ready to continue the negotiation process in a civilized and legal manner, in any format, with our Tajik neighbours.@@@Considering that our trust has been weakened by the recent lawless actions of our neighbour, we are ready to continue negotiations and welcome the mediation efforts of international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.@@@We have documented evidence of both yesterday’s and last year’s illegal and ill-intentioned actions of the Tajik side.@@@We are never the first to start and never will be.@@@We always try to avoid using weapons, and even more so, we never shoot at unarmed civilians.@@@We are always forced to respond accordingly and adequately to the aggression of the Tajik side.@@@In that regard, I emphasize that the Kyrgyz side does not claim foreign lands and does not intend to cede a centimetre of its land to anyone.@@@We are convinced that all border and internal issues should be resolved at the negotiation table, and we are willing and ready in this regard.@@@The most important issue today is the adoption of urgent measures to ensure security and stability in the border areas, to stop any actions aimed at increasing tensions among the local population, and to strengthen the trust between our two States.@@@We are always ready for negotiations and clarification of our borders.@@@Regarding general United Nations issues, I would like to note the following.@@@This year, with half of the implementation period of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) having passed, we can now objectively look at the real situation at hand.@@@The adoption of the SDGs in 2015, under the motto “leave no one behind”, was a bright example of the constructive negotiation capacity of the world community in the interests of all of us and subsequent generations.@@@Meanwhile, it has already become obvious that owing to objective circumstances, including the coronavirus pandemic, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries, including our own, has slowed.@@@Without adequate international funding, many may not even achieve the critical indicators of the SDGs.@@@I wish to reiterate the firm commitment of the Kyrgyz Republic to the SDGs and to their gradual implementation, taking into account our national capacities.@@@I believe that our country’s own potential should be the main source and engine of sustainable development.@@@For those purposes, our efforts are aimed at achieving the accelerated and qualitative growth of the economy, including through mutually beneficial regional and international trade and investment cooperation.@@@For example, Kyrgyzstan actively participates in integration and cooperation processes, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the One Belt, One Road initiative of the People’s Republic of China.@@@The country is actively developing the locomotive of the “green economy”.@@@With respect to the hydropower industry, small and medium-sized hydropower plants are being put into operation.@@@Our esteemed neighbours Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan will participate in the construction of the largest hydroelectric power station — Kambarata — which will strengthen the energy security and optimize the use of water resources in the region.@@@In general, I want to note the spirit of unity, mutual understanding, trust and support that was demonstrated in the city of Cholpon-Ata two months ago, when the fourth consultative meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia was held under the chairmanship of Kyrgyzstan.@@@I hope that the signing by all parties of the Cholpon-Ata Treaty of Friendship, Good- Neighbourliness and Cooperation for the Development of Central Asia in the Twenty-First Century will open a new page in our inter-State relations.@@@We are committed to continuing work in that format.@@@In conclusion, I want to assure the Assembly that Kyrgyzstan fully supports the United Nations as the only universal structure authorized by all of the States Members of the United Nations to meet the challenges faced by humankind.@@@I hope that the United Nations will continue to properly perform all its functions and assist Member States in overcoming challenges and solving urgent global problems.@@@I urge all Member States to provide unconditional political support and solidarity to the Organization in this difficult international time.@@@I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@I would also like to thank the Secretary- General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his leadership, as well as those whose daily work is dedicated to the ideals of the United Nations.@@@We meet in critical times.@@@This Hall, the venue for so many historic events, is in and of itself a testament to some of the ideas that this Organization, one of the most important in world history, is built on.@@@In this Hall, during this session, we are equal.@@@Whether we represent a global super-Power or one of the more than 70 Member States, like mine, with less than 1 million inhabitants, in this Hall we all have the same number of seats at the table, we each have a vote and we all have a voice and the right to let it be heard from this rostrum.@@@At the hand of the President of the General Assembly, there is a gavel — a simple wooden hammer, an instrument so light and non-threatening that it could hardly be of any use as a weapon.@@@Nevertheless, the person who holds it can take control of the deliberations of the most powerful women and men in the world.@@@The striking of that small hammer against a simple block of wood compels respect for the rules that the Members of the United Nations have agreed to abide by in this Hall.@@@It is a symbol of order.@@@And it is therefore fitting that the inscription on the gavel says “Me5 logum skal land byggja”, in Icelandic, as it was donated by Iceland to this great Organization.@@@It means that “society shall be built on the pillars of law”.@@@It is a quote from an ancient Icelandic text of law, and the next line elaborates with the statement that the land will indeed be desolated if lawlessness or unjust law are allowed to take hold.@@@In the global context, we are all acutely aware, not least the smaller States, that a world not governed by rules will be a world dominated by force.@@@We meet at a time when a powerful country, a permanent member of the Security Council, has decided to challenge the norms and international laws that have served the world so well since world leaders, with the horrors of two World Wars vivid in their memory, decided to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and the untold sorrow that it brings to humankind.@@@The post-World War order has not prevented problems and conflicts from arising.@@@Mistakes and questionable decisions have been made.@@@The sorrows and horrors of war and conflict have indeed been a part of too many lives in too many parts of the world.@@@But, by and large, wars of territorial expansion have simply not been allowed.@@@In my part of the world, my generation does not hold memories of the horrors of a global war.@@@We grew up believing that peace among nations can almost be taken for granted.@@@Well, it cannot.@@@However, the global system has provided an answer to the critical questions of how problems are solved.@@@That construct is now under threat, and it is our duty as leaders, not least those of us who are young, to make sure that the fortunes of the past decades do not lead us into dangerous complacency.@@@We must advocate for the multilateral system at every opportunity and convince the peoples of the world that, despite its flaws, it is vastly and completely superior to any other method of resolving issues and disputes between States.@@@Of course, we must continue to reform our organization and make it more fit for purpose and more representative in order to meet growing and more complicated new challenges.@@@Iceland fully supports the vision of the Secretary-General put forward in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) on how we can revitalize our work and strengthen the multilateral system so that it can best serve future generations.@@@Russia’s unlawful and brutal full-scale invasion of Ukraine came as a shock, a rude awakening to how the world might look if the ability to destroy, rather than the capacity to create, is allowed to determine the fate of nations.@@@The absolute and sickening brutality that Russia has shown, as evidenced in newly liberated areas, is beyond comprehension.@@@It represents an absolute breakdown of civilization.@@@Therefore, before I say anything else about world affairs, I will say that, for the sake of humankind, Ukraine must win.@@@Russia’s aggression must be defeated, and the crimes perpetrated in its name must be accounted for and punished.@@@The irresponsible words of Russia’s President these past few days are a chilling reminder that giving in to bullies and rule-breakers will only encourage more bullying and further rule-breaking.@@@For the sake of humankind, this madness must stop.@@@The number of people who are faced with food insecurity, poverty and hunger is increasing at a terrifying rate due to the lingering effects of the pandemic and the pandemic response, armed conflict and climate change.@@@The number of people facing acute food insecurity has soared to 345 million this year, with no end in sight.@@@Natural catastrophes linked to climate change are becoming more relentless and severe, as evidenced by the recent flooding in Pakistan and the droughts in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, for example.@@@Iceland will continue to increase its funding for humanitarian assistance, working primarily with United Nations entities.@@@Iceland is committed to shouldering its responsibility, as demonstrated by our increase in humanitarian and development assistance.@@@We face a climate crisis that will not go away on its own.@@@It is paramount that all countries make every effort to accelerate our fight towards better climate resilience.@@@Iceland is committed to doing its part and has set ambitious targets of achieving carbon neutrality and full energy conversion no later than 2040.@@@We increased our contribution to climate financing, with a strong focus on a balanced approached to mitigation and adaptation, and we are committed to do more.@@@There is a public health crisis in many countries.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic showed how fragile health-care systems really are when tested.@@@This problem will not go away on its own, as the demographic realities of many countries paint quite a serious picture.@@@In many places there is also a mental health crisis.@@@The pandemic exposed many faults in the way we tackle global crises, and we will be dealing with those consequences for a long time.@@@While rich countries were able to vaccinate their entire populations, that protection was denied to the most vulnerable in the poorer regions of the world.@@@Meanwhile, it will be a matter for future historians to judge if the economic sacrifices made during the pandemic were worth the benefits, or if the widespread curtailment of individual liberties that we saw, with increased social isolation, were the wisest response to the crisis.@@@An English poem published almost 500 years ago says that no man is an island — indeed.@@@But not only is no man an island, no country is an island — not even the countries like Iceland that are actually islands.@@@The decisions made in one part of the world can have great consequences, intended or unintended, across the globe.@@@Of course, that applies in particular to the oceans, which cover 70 per cent of our planet’s surface and whose waters do not respect any national boundaries.@@@For Iceland, sustainable fisheries and a dynamic blue economy are critical.@@@It is our responsibility to ensure the sustainable use and health of our oceans for the benefit of all.@@@Tackling marine pollution is a priority, in particular plastic waste, and we welcome the important steps taken in Nairobi earlier this year in that regard.@@@Allow me also to highlight the renewed spirit that the 2022 United Nations Ocean Conference, in Lisbon, brought us, including increased recognition of the importance of food from the ocean in our food systems and for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace.@@@For 40 years, our constitution of the ocean, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, has served as a solid foundation for international cooperation on everything related to the oceans.@@@It is a prime example of a diplomatic success that has stood the test of time and continues to serve us well.@@@With new environmental challenges, along with increased awareness and scientific knowledge of the importance and vulnerability of the ocean, the time is ripe to conclude negotiations on a new agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Iceland welcomes the progress made during the negotiations last month and is determined to do its part to reach an agreement.@@@The role of the United Nations and its institutions in these crises is therefore of the utmost importance.@@@While the current and impending crises we are facing must be dealt with, we must not neglect the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The year 2030 is fast approaching, yet we are nowhere near the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace.@@@Iceland aims to shoulder its responsibility, as demonstrated by the increase in official development assistance.@@@We must also not give up on our aim of a world free of nuclear weapons.@@@The failure to reach consensus on advancing the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — only a month ago, in this very Hall — is further testament to the irresponsible behaviour of the Russian Federation — the lone opponent of the final document and the only State that has lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons by explicitly threatening to resort to such weapons of mass destruction.@@@“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”@@@The world cannot afford to deny anyone the opportunity to contribute to the solutions that we collectively need.@@@Too widely, we are witnessing an increase in the repression of religious and ethnic minorities, racism, anti-Semitism and violent nationalism.@@@Autocratic tendencies and voices that seek to intensify political polarization are on the rise.@@@Iceland remains committed to countering the regression we have witnessed in the rights of women and girls in too many places around the world.@@@The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons across the world have either never been secured or have regressed.@@@The values and principles embodied in the United Nations Charter, international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not only important in and of themselves; they are absolutely critical if we are to harness the individual creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mindset that we so desperately need to rely on in our quest for human-made solutions to our human-made problems.@@@Those ideals are another example of how the method of solving problems is a more pressing matter than the resolution of any individual problem.@@@And we know that the answer to humankind’s challenges lies in the human spirit itself — if it is allowed to live out its truest potential.@@@The job of leaders is not easy when times require sacrifices.@@@We are all aware of the challenges that open societies face.@@@The freedom of expression means that it is possible to spread lies and false information.@@@That is a real problem that we need to address.@@@Free societies need to become more resilient, with a strong, well-educated and well-informed public being the first and best line of defence against those who seek to manipulate with lies, conspiracy theories and hate-mongering.@@@However, when we worry about the misuse of the freedom of expression in open societies, let us not forget that the truly terrifying misuse of information is when Governments claim a monopoly on truth.@@@Relentless propaganda and brainwashing by official sources in corrupt Governments with evil intentions can lead to a truly terrifying result.@@@That is what we have seen in Russia, where all forms of public debate and independent thinking have been criminalized.@@@A society where people hesitate to criticize — let alone ridicule — authority, the official truth or the established narrative is not truly free.@@@For the peoples of the world to be able to find the transformative solutions that the world so desperately needs, people must be able to challenge the status quo.@@@They must be free to express their opinions and debate freely on even the most sensitive issues.@@@They must also be free to create art, even if the art is distasteful.@@@Those are the values that the defenders of Ukraine want to secure for their children.@@@Those are the values that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is demanding for the people of Belarus.@@@Those values are being denied to Afghan women and girls under the Taliban regime.@@@Those are the values that do not accept that Mahsa Amini was beaten to death in Iran for wearing a hijab incorrectly.@@@Let us not forget that the Russian Government is guilty of horrific abuses not only on the international scene.@@@Brave Russians resisters to Putin’s system and the thousands who showed up on the streets of Russia earlier this week are all subject to harsh punishments, wrongful imprisonment, persecution and often worse.@@@The almost 500-year-old short poem by John Donne that I quoted before includes another famous line.@@@As it discusses how interconnected the world was in 1524, it reads: “and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls”, meaning that we should view it as our duty to respond to common challenges, and not look the other way or wait for others to act.@@@We must answer the call.@@@Even if the challenges that we face were not created by the younger generations, and they were not created by the poor of the world, all of humankind will nevertheless have to take part in overcoming them.@@@Whether we like it or not, and whether we deserve or not, it falls to the leaders of today and tomorrow to face our common reality.@@@Whether we like it or not, and whether we deserve it or not, we must do that together.@@@We must all answer the call.@@@We must answer the call to stand with Ukraine.@@@We must answer the call to defend the multilateral system.@@@It is also us who must answer the call to defend our nature and fight back against climate change and combat poverty and deprivation.@@@Finally, we must answer the call to defend the rights of individuals and give them the opportunity to contribute to the solutions that are so desperately needed.@@@If we do not, we have failed.@@@I am grateful for the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and to once again be reminded that the possibility for nations to come together and exchange ideas and views in a civilized manner remains the norm in international relations, and that those who break the rules are almost universally condemned.@@@The noble aim of the Organization — to spare the world from the sorrows of war — is perhaps now more relevant than ever before.@@@Order in the world must be restored.@@@I would like to wholeheartedly greet everyone on behalf of myself and my nation.@@@I hope and pray that the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly will yield the best possible results for us, our countries and the entire human race.@@@I would also like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi for having assumed the presidency of the General Assembly and for his theme for this year’s session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, which appears to be very appropriate.@@@We meet at a time when we are trying to sort out many challenges on a global scale.@@@One of the biggest lessons of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was how to build international solidarity in resolving global threats.@@@During the pandemic, Tiirkiye managed to provide humanitarian aid, without any discrimination, to more than 161 countries and 12 international organizations.@@@We also contributed to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, as well as national and local vaccine efforts, in the service of the entire human race.@@@Last year, we ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in order to demonstrate the extent of our resolve in the fight against climate change and our aim of becoming a zero-emission country by 2053.@@@We also convened the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Istanbul, which showed our willingness to become pioneers in the fight against climate change.@@@The global economy was impacted heavily by the supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic, and with the addition of the Russia-Ukraine crisis we are experiencing a new wave of shock.@@@Energy, food and raw materials prices are increasing, creating the enormous pressure of inflation, which has significant ramifications for the world’s economies and social welfare systems.@@@Those developments have proved once again the high importance of energy supply security.@@@Since the shock began, Tiirkiye has focused on energy not as an issue of competition but as an area for cooperation.@@@Taking into account our own needs, we have revived many projects to support energy security, not only in our region but also on a global scale.@@@In the light of recent developments, our approach has proved to be effective.@@@The situation we are facing has also jeopardized food supply security.@@@This is the twenty-first century — we have never had as many financial and technological opportunities as we do now.@@@Yet one fifth of the world’s population still currently faces crippling rates of poverty and hunger.@@@The world was aiming to reach zero poverty and hunger by the year 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals, but given recent developments it seems like we are moving away from our projected achievements.@@@It is time for us to shed light on our path, and that can be done only through international cooperation and solidarity and by taking just and fair approaches to our dealings with one another.@@@We need to take action together to combat the challenges of our common fate.@@@Tiirkiye is willing to demonstrate its willingness to do that, as we have done with the pandemic and the climate change crisis.@@@We have also demonstrated our stance in combating the crisis caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.@@@The Ukrainian conflict has surpassed the seven-month threshold, and we believe that while there will never be a winner in this war, a fair peace process should not have any losers.@@@That is important to us, as we have consistently underlined the importance of using diplomacy, through dialogue, in order to settle disputes once and for all.@@@That is why we brought together the parties at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, and then in Istanbul, in order to facilitate the reconciliation process.@@@As a result of our significant efforts together with the Secretary-General, we have managed to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and it has found its way to other global markets.@@@The agreement reached in Istanbul to enable those exports, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, is still critical, and those exports will increase over time.@@@That agreement, undertaken jointly with the United Nations, is one of our Organization’s greatest accomplishments in recent decades.@@@I think that the international community has revived its confidence in the United Nations as a result of the agreement in Istanbul, because it proved once again that negotiations can yield results, especially on issues that are vital to all the parties involved.@@@We have taken a similar approach to the issue of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is threatening the security of the entire globe.@@@The conflict is escalating, and we are investing tremendous efforts in order to ensure an end to the war by definitively protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@We urge all the international organizations and countries of the world to support Tiirkiye’s peaceful initiatives to settle the dispute once and for all.@@@We need a dignified way
out of this crisis, which can be found only through a rational, fair and appropriate diplomatic solution.@@@On the other hand, all the disasters affecting millions of people have shown once again that the United Nations will have to be much more effective and influential and that it has a responsibility to invest further efforts in resolving problems on a global scale.@@@The United Nations will have to be much more inclusive and be capable of creating effective solutions for a fairer world.@@@The United Nations must become an international organization in which the common will of the entire human race can be advanced.@@@The Security Council in particular must be more effective, democratic, transparent, accountable and functional in order to help the entire human race in its search for peace, justice and welfare.@@@That is going to be a turning point for us all.@@@In order to remember our collective responsibility, we have been reiterating that one world is better than five and that a fairer world is still possible.@@@We have repeated those remarks on every platform at every opportunity.@@@We are committed and determined in our fight, and we expect the entire world to support us.@@@I therefore once again call on the Assembly for its support.@@@Our foreign policy vision has been always peace-oriented.@@@We have worked tirelessly, beginning in our region, to ensure that peace prevails in the entire world.@@@In our “Mediation for peace” initiative, which we conduct under the auspices of the United Nations, we have worked tirelessly to resolve conflicts in Europe, Latin America, Africa and other areas.@@@We seek to act as a mediator or facilitator in order to settle disputes once and for all.@@@Our country is located in the heart of a region surrounded by conflict, but we seek to be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem, which is possible only through the initiatives that we choose to undertake.@@@In that regard, we have always stressed that a peaceful, permanent reliable settlement must be found for the Syrian conflict in the framework of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).@@@I believe that, if that conflict continues, it will threaten Syria’s territorial security and welfare and that of our region.@@@Our country has hosted 4 million civilians of Syrian descent to date.@@@I think that the Security Council must shoulder its responsibility to extend resolution 2642 (2022), enabling the humanitarian aid mechanism that was established in Syria’s north-west.@@@There, we are fighting terrorist organizations such as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and its offshoots, which pose a significant and clear threat to Tiirkiye and its security forces.@@@That terrorist organization changes its name on a continuous basis and tries to legitimize itself.@@@We must urge global forces to stop weaponizing those terrorist organizations and stop making the same mistakes of the past.@@@We are powerful enough to take every necessary measure against terrorism, and I want to remind everyone of that again.@@@We will never shy away from combating terrorism and will always be very resolved to take the necessary measures to combat it.@@@We seek to do everything in our capacity and with the utmost sincerity to ensure that our Syrian brothers and sisters are able to return to their country in a dignified, safe and secure manner.@@@We seek to create conditions that are conducive to returning civilians who fled the war to their motherland and ensuring that they lead dignified lives.@@@We are building 100,000 brick homes in several parts of Syria so that they can seek refuge there.@@@The vast majority of those homes have already been completed and handed over to their owners.@@@We have also started preparations to build an additional 200,000 housing units so that 1 million Syrians will be able to go back to their homeland.@@@Those projects will be completed in safe zones in a total of 13 different centres and rural areas, and we need the support of the international community in order for that to be possible.@@@We need all the stakeholders in that project to demonstrate serious solidarity and commitment.@@@Irregular migration — the refugee crisis — cannot be solved by leaving people to their demise, building border walls and placing them in refugee camps.@@@We can solve that problem only through efforts focused on humankind and human life.@@@That approach is being taken in Greece, and we can clearly see that the Greeks are becoming much more tolerant towards the refugees around the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.@@@Tiirkiye does not want to see the bodies of babies such as Aylan being washed ashore.@@@But at the same time, Greece is unfortunately pushing back those refugees in an illegal and deliberate manner, turning the Aegean into a graveyard for refugees.@@@Last week, a 9-month-old baby named Assam and a 4-year-old, Abdul Wahab, died because the Hellenic Coast Guard forces sank their boats.@@@I think that it is high time for Europe, as well as the United Nations and other international
organizations, to say “stop” and “that is enough” to such crimes, which are crimes against humanity.@@@In another of our neighbouring countries, Iraq, we seek to invest significant efforts in order to ensure that peace and prosperity can be established there as well.@@@We want political reconciliation to be established and political unity to be formed within the framework of an Iraqi identity.@@@We must work together in order to sustainably establish prosperity in Iraq and stop the abuses being committed by terrorist organizations there.@@@Nevertheless, there are terrorist organizations that continue to abuse Iraq’s instability, and we will never stop fighting the Iraq-based terrorist organizations that have taken violent action against Tiirkiye.@@@As I have said in this Hall many times, we will fight terrorism without any discrimination, and our commitment to genuine solidarity will help us achieve our goals.@@@We will fight back against terrorism in all its forms, regardless of the names of its groups, and we want our allies — our friends — to provide us with the solidarity and commitment we need.@@@It is natural for us to expect others to cooperate with us rather than terrorist organizations and tyrant regimes.@@@We want our neighbours to forge solidarity with us in order to contribute to the stability, peace and welfare of our entire region and the world, and we are ready to work with them.@@@From a global security perspective, we need to focus on North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.@@@In that framework, it is critical to establish stability and welfare in Libya, not only for the world but also for the entire region.@@@Tiirkiye strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations in that regard.@@@We want to protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the Libyan people and ensure that they attain their much-desired level of prosperity.@@@Fair and universal elections should be held in Libya, and a strong Government with the legitimacy of the will of the people must be established there, which is something that we all have to work towards.@@@In order to ensure peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East, we need to put an end to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict once and for all by establishing a two-State solution, which is something we strongly support.@@@We must preserve the historical and cultural identity of Jerusalem and respect Haram Al-Sharif, and we must stop the illegal settlements in the occupied regions by establishing security guarantees for Palestinians and their property.@@@We must establish a permanent and fair solution for the region, with East Jerusalem as the capital and through the establishment of a free and sovereign Palestinian State.@@@That is the only solution.@@@It is in the best interests of the Palestinian people, the Israeli people, the region and the entire world.@@@We will contribute efforts to making that possible.@@@It is also the international community’s responsibility to increase the institutional and financial capacity of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.@@@We are also concerned about the problems in Iran.@@@We have always supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.@@@We need diplomacy and dialogue to settle the disputes regarding Iran’s nuclear programme once and for all.@@@With regard to Azerbaijan, the liberation of its occupied territories has offered a historic opportunity for a permanent peace and stability in the South Caucasus.@@@Tiirkiye has been supportive of the process between Azerbaijan and Armenia.@@@We have taken significant steps to make the best use of that opportunity.@@@Recent clashes have cast a dark shadow on those positive developments, but we believe that it is still possible to achieve sustainable peace between those two countries.@@@We will always stand by our Azerbaijani brothers in building their homes and their future in a legitimate and justified manner.@@@The opening, without delay, of the transportation routes in the region, which is an issue that also concerns our country closely, will contribute tremendously to the welfare the entire region.@@@At the same time, Afghanistan has struggled with conflicts, terrorism and poverty for almost half a century and is currently experiencing a challenging period.@@@The interim Government must take the necessary steps to protect fundamental human rights, which could pave the way for some promising developments.@@@Tiirkiye will continue supporting its Afghan brothers and sisters during that process.@@@India and Pakistan, following the establishment of their sovereignty and independence 75 years ago, still have not established peace and solidarity between one another, which is unfortunate.@@@We hope and pray that fair and permanent peace and prosperity will be established in Kashmir.@@@We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the people of Pakistan with regard to the catastrophic
floods that they recently experienced.@@@In response to the flood, we launched a humanitarian aid campaign, which is ongoing.@@@We call on the international community to support the Pakistani people during this regrettable and painful period.@@@We support the safe, voluntary and dignified return of the Rohingya Muslims to their homeland.@@@We are very sensitive to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Muslim Uyghur Turks in such a way that it will not threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of China.@@@In the Balkans, we are investing tremendous efforts on multiple platforms to strengthen peace and stability and to settle disputes through dialogue.@@@At the beginning of September, we conducted an official visit to the region, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia.@@@I think that the finalization of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will contribute tremendously to the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue process and the stability of the region.@@@As a country, Tiirkiye wants all the issues in the Aegean Sea and in the eastern Mediterranean to be resolved within the framework of good-neighbourly relations and in conformity with international law.@@@Those countries that pursue a show of force in our region seem foolish and are no match for us.@@@In the eastern Mediterranean, peace and stability depends on respect for the rights of all the parties.@@@We expect Greece to set aside its provocative policies and to heed our calls for cooperation and solidarity.@@@We believe that the eastern Mediterranean conference, which we have recommended previously, will serve that purpose.@@@The fact that our interlocutors have not made even the slightest effort to respond to that call shows who supports peace and dialogue and who supports conflict.@@@Tiirkiye will always defend its rights in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean and will never yield to the escalation strategies led by other countries.@@@With regard to the Cyprus issued, we have always sought to reach a just, lasting and sustainable resolution, and we are working together with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to that end.@@@There are two States and two different peoples on that island, and that should be universally accepted.@@@The acceptance of the equal sovereignty and the international status of the Turkish Cypriots is key to a settlement on the island.@@@We hereby call on the international community to put an end to the oppression of the Turkish Cypriots and to the sanctions imposed on them.@@@Greece, a member of the European Union, is inhumanely pushing back refugees in the Aegean Sea and is imposing policies against the Turkish Muslim minority in violation of its legal obligations.@@@We hope that Greece will bring an end to all those wrongful practices and that the European Union will stop turning a blind eye to those inhumane and unlawful actions.@@@The value of Tiirkiye’s cooperation with the European Union is important in addressing regional and global challenges.@@@As a strong ally of NATO, Tiirkiye is celebrating its seventieth anniversary as a member of the organization.@@@We have diplomatic initiatives and military capabilities that are contributing to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region.@@@We seek to contribute to the security, stability and prosperity of the European continent.@@@And as a part of Asia on the Western coast of Europe, we are also leading initiatives on the Asian continent, such as the Asia Anew initiative, with a view to assuming a more proactive role.@@@We are trying to establish closer contacts and solidarity with African countries through the recent global initiatives that we have undertaken.@@@In that context, in Istanbul from 16 to 18 December 2021, we held the third Tiirkiye-Africa Partnership Summit, which was widely attended by our African friends.@@@Tiirkiye has always shown its commitment, as an equal partner, to Africa’s journey towards stability, development and prosperity.@@@Our cooperation with Latin America is also getting stronger, on the basis of mutual respect, and we are going to invest efforts institutionally to become more proactive in Latin America.@@@The international community is being shaken by several challenges.@@@The biggest threat we are currently facing is the loss of the will to live together.@@@We are deeply concerned by the rise of racism, discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia in recent years.@@@We have repeatedly called for 15 March, the date on which the terrorist attack against Muslims in New Zealand took place, to be declared the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and we reiterate that appeal once again.@@@We have taken action, first within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and subsequently within the General Assembly, to ensure that that date is
declared the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and hope that wish will be realized.@@@As I have emphasized many times before, we consider Islamophobia along the same lines as antisemitism.@@@We also consider it a crime against humanity.@@@With that in mind, I hope that the General Assembly, at its seventy- seventh session, will be able to accomplish the goals that will respond to the expectations and aspirations of the entire human race.@@@I extend my wishes for health and peace to all States.@@@Once again, I wish to express to all Member States, on my behalf and on behalf of my nation, my appreciation and respect.@@@Many leaders have spoken here over the past few days.@@@We share the same concerns.@@@The current state of our world is very worrying.@@@The pandemic persists and the global economy remains sluggish.@@@War among nations is no longer a mere possibility but has become a reality.@@@The violation of international law has become a norm in pursuit of narrow self-interest.@@@Crisis after crisis is unfolding around the world, including climate change, rising inflation food and energy shortages.@@@History teaches us that these phenomena might lead to a huge war.@@@Let us look at the period leading up to the Second World War.@@@The Great Depression, the rise of ultranationalism competition over resources and rivalry between major Powers — these are very similar to what we are facing today.@@@Clearly, we have been handling these challenges the wrong way.@@@We have been divided instead of united.@@@We have been working individually instead of collectively.@@@We have been focusing on words instead of deeds.@@@The question now is: What are we going to do about it?@@@Are we going to continue along the same path or are we going to choose a different path?@@@If we continue on the same path, we will be heading towards a disaster, but if we choose a different path, we might stand a chance.@@@So, today I would like to offer a world order based on a new paradigm — a paradigm of win-win, not of zero sum; a paradigm of engagement, not of containment; a paradigm of collaboration, not of competition.@@@This is the transformative solution that we need.@@@Allow me to share why we need this new paradigm.@@@First, we must reignite the spirit of peace.@@@A deficit of trust breeds hatred and fear and may lead to conflict.@@@We have witnessed these phenomena in many parts of the world.@@@We must turn the trust deficit into strategic trust, and that starts with upholding respect for international law The fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.@@@I repeat — the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.@@@Those principles must always be upheld.@@@Meanwhile, the peaceful solution is the only option for settling any conflict.@@@A habit of dialogue and cooperation would nurture strategic trust.@@@These are the rules of the game that we must maintain if we truly want peace.@@@It is our responsibility to apply them consistently, not selectively or only when we see fit.@@@My President conveyed these messages of peace in his visits to Kyiv and Moscow in June.@@@We must also apply this new paradigm to make a breakthrough in Palestine and Afghanistan.@@@For far too long, the people of Palestine have suffered and longed for peace.@@@Until Palestine can truly become an independent State, Indonesia will stand firm in solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.@@@The people of Afghanistan also deserve a peaceful and prosperous life where the rights of all, including women, are equally respected and where women’s and girls’ access to education is granted.@@@Without that new paradigm, peace will remain an elusive dream.@@@Secondly, we must revive our responsibility for global recovery.@@@We are concerned that global solidarity is fading away, whereas injustice and selfishness abound, the weak stand small and the mighty take all.@@@We are seeing the symptoms every day.@@@Trade discrimination is running rampant.@@@The monopoly in the global supply chain persists.@@@Global economic governance is used to justify the rules of the strong.@@@The pandemic teaches us the valuable lesson that no one is safe until everyone is.@@@That lesson shapes the priorities of Indonesia’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20).@@@The whole world is pinning its hope on G-20 as a catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for developing countries.@@@The G-20 must not fail We cannot let global recovery fall to the mercy of geopolitics.@@@We must act urgently to address food and energy crises and prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening.@@@Otherwise, billions more people will be at risk particularly in developing countries.@@@We also need a new paradigm as we move beyond the recovery.@@@A new paradigm would instil a collective responsibility to attain the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and fight climate change.@@@Without that new paradigm, there will not be a strong recovery for all and many of us will be left behind.@@@Thirdly, we must bolster regional partnership.@@@In many places, the post-war regional architecture was built as a tool for containment and alienation.@@@That phenomenon continues today with mini-lateral groupings.@@@Many become part of a proxy war between major Powers.@@@That is not what regional architecture should be.@@@It must serve as the building block for peace and stability, rather than undermine them.@@@The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was built exactly for this purpose.@@@We refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War.@@@Instead, we actively promote the paradigm of collaboration with all countries.@@@That paradigm will also guide Indonesia’s chairmanship of ASEAN next year.@@@It is the commitment of Indonesia to forge ASEAN’s centrality in shaping regional order in the Indo-Pacific, to reinforce ASEAN’s unity as a locomotive for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, and to ensure that ASEAN matters to our peoples, to the region and to the world.@@@ASEAN will also continue to address seriously the situation in Myanmar.@@@Indonesia is deeply concerned by the military junta’s lack of commitment to implementing the five-point consensus.@@@ASEAN must move forward and not be taken hostage by the situation in Myanmar.@@@The support of the international community, in particular the neighbouring countries of Myanmar, is very important to restoring democracy in Myanmar.@@@On the Pacific, Indonesia will continue to strengthen our cooperation with the Pacific countries.@@@We will work together to address our shared challenges, including on climate change.@@@As a Pacific nation ourself, we want to see the Pacific as an integral part of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.@@@The new paradigm of collaboration must be the spirit of the United Nations.@@@Inclusive and meaningful engagement must trump the take-it-or-leave-it approach, and the voices of all countries big and small, developed and developing, matter equally.@@@That is the very foundation of multilateralism.@@@That is why we need a strong and reformed United Nations.@@@It is why we need a renewed multilateralism that is fit for purpose and fit for its time.@@@That is why we need a multilateralism that delivers.@@@I repeat — we need a multilateralism that delivers.@@@I believe that by working together and adopting a new paradigm, we can create a better world for all.@@@It is no longer the time to talk the talk; ow is the time to walk the talk.@@@On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, it is my pleasure to congratulate the President on his election to preside
over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish him every success in his tasks.@@@We also commend the distinctive work done by his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, and we highly appreciate the outcome of his presidency.@@@We reiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, to reform our Organization.@@@We express to him our support and backing for his initiatives and proposals contained in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when our world is witnessing multidimensional crises with global intertwined repercussions.@@@Three years after the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, our world faces a series of deep challenges and successive crises.@@@What prevents us from managing those crises in an efficient and effective manner is not the fact that we are not aware of their manifestations and interactions, but rather the absence of genuine political will.@@@The multilateral system is currently going through a systemic crisis that manifests itself at three interrelated levels.@@@The first level relates to the crisis in values, in which the principle of cooperation and solidarity, on which the United Nations was founded, is being undermined due to the prioritization of narrow national interests over universal human values.@@@The second level is related to the divisions within international institutions, which have become an arena for competition in a way that negatively affects international multilateral action.@@@The third level relates to the fragmentation of multilateral work in the context of narrow, circumstantial alliances, which are not commensurate with the current complex crises.@@@The current international situation requires courage and objectivity to answer the following questions.@@@Do we want our Organization to be capable of leading strategic changes and facing the major challenges of our time, or do we want it to be limited to only crisis management?@@@Does our Organization still have the ability to reach an international consensus and find innovative solutions to deal with the current and future challenges of the world?@@@We would like to say that those who believe that their own capabilities are sufficient alone to contain such challenges are not being realistic.@@@Multilateral work has never been a luxury, and the comprehensive crises that we are experiencing today confirm that and prove that the security and well-being of some depend on the stability and prosperity of others.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its conviction that multilateral action should be based primarily on collective interaction, consensual and renewed approaches, as emphasized by His Majesty King Mohammed VI in his address before the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, when he said:
“Morocco reaffirms its commitment to support the emergence of a new multilateral system built on international legality, justice and equity and cooperation in social and economic relations, and based on an efficient and dynamic United Nations system.”@@@(A/59/PV4.@@@p.23)@@@The African continent is the most affected by the repercussions of the difficult economic situation as a result of the global geopolitical crisis, as it bears the brunt of the increase in food and energy prices, which undermines the continent’s gains in the area of sustainable development.@@@Despite that, Africa has all the components to turn challenges into opportunities and emerge from this crisis stronger.@@@The African continent has significant human and natural resources in addition to the gains and future benefits that it can achieve by implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area.@@@That was affirmed by His Majesty the King in his address at the 28th Ordinary Summit of the African Union when he said:
“We, the peoples of Africa, have the means and the genius, and, together, we can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples.”@@@In that context, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for promoting international cooperation to serve the interests of African countries by reducing the debt burden and launching integrated development initiatives that will enhance their resilience and resist the shocks of current and future economic crises.@@@The repeated visits of His Majesty King Mohammed VI to several African countries attest to that conviction.@@@His Majesty has launched several cooperation and partnership projects to promote human development,
guarantee food security and bolster economic growth in order to achieve African integration.@@@Under the auspices of His Majesty, the Kingdom of Morocco hosted the fourteenth United States-Africa Business Summit to encourage investment in priority sectors in African countries.@@@Several countries continue to suffer from the repercussions of COVID-19.@@@The challenge lies in providing a consistent and adequate supply of vaccines and distributing them equitably among all the countries of the world.@@@As part of his commitment to the African affiliation, His Majesty launched a new factory to manufacture COVID-19 and other vaccines, a structural project that will promote the achievement of vaccine sovereignty in the Kingdom of Morocco and throughout the African continent, in line with achieving his Majesty’s vision.@@@The pandemic has demonstrated that good health and prosperity are not only a main goal of sustainable development but also fundamental conditions and pillars of sustainable development.@@@The Moroccan Government, upon instructions from His Majesty, is implementing and expanding health coverage, benefiting 70 per cent of our people.@@@We hope to cover 100 per cent of the population by the end of the year.@@@Climate change requires immediate and urgent solutions.@@@Beyond well-intentioned statements, we need to contain this crisis, which is jeopardizing development in many parts of the world and could lead to famine, homelessness and environmental displacement.@@@In that context and in line with His Majesty’s vision, the Kingdom of Morocco has warned of the consequences of the climate crisis on the African continent, which has suffered its greatest impact.@@@It is therefore incumbent upon the developed countries to garner the needed technological and financial resources to support the African States in addressing the consequences of that global challenge.@@@The Kingdom has decided to increase its nationally determined contribution and reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 45.5 per cent by 2030, in the context of Morocco’s integrated strategy to achieve low- carbon development by 2050.@@@The strategy is aimed at creating a green economy in line with the principles of sustainability, the pillars on which we have built the new development model within the Kingdom.@@@That ambition underpins the Kingdom of Morocco’s intention to uphold the commitments it undertook at the 2016 African Summit in Marrakech, which was held on the sidelines of the twenty-second Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, under the presidency of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, especially with regard to developing capacities in the agricultural sector, adapting to climate change and increasing the use of sustainable energy.@@@Global tensions will continue to adversely impact the efforts being deployed to achieve food security unless countries develop their domestic capacities to take the new reality into account.@@@In that context, Morocco has been investing in the agricultural sector so that it can adapt to climate change.@@@We have been strengthening South-South cooperation with the African continent, on which nearly half of the world’s unused arable land is located.@@@At the national level, Morocco is implementing the Generation Green 2020-2030 plan under the directives of His Majesty in order achieve food security.@@@The global security crises are directly affecting human migration throughout the world.@@@In line with His Majesty’s vision, the Kingdom of Morocco is committed to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was signed in Marrakech in December 2018.@@@In that regard, the Kingdom will continue to demonstrate its solidarity in implementing its national strategy for migration and asylum, which was launched by His Majesty in 2013.@@@In the same vein, Morocco continues to combat human trafficking networks, which represent a serious threat to the sovereignty and stability of States and the security and safety of individuals.@@@Peacekeeping is one of the most important achievements of the Organization, and we must therefore pool our efforts and capabilities to develop it and guarantee peacekeepers’ safety.@@@In demonstrating his permanent commitment to peacekeeping on the occasion of the sixty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces, His Majesty gave instructions to create a Moroccan multidisciplinary peacekeeping centre to provide training and support national and foreign capacities, especially on the African continent, in partnership with the United Nations and several friendly countries, in order to promote the principles of international peace and security.@@@Gender equality and the promotion of the rights of women and their full participation in decision-making are preconditions to overcoming current and future global challenges.@@@In line with that and with His Majesty’s vision, Morocco is working to promote gender equality as the foundation for a fair and democratic society.@@@His Majesty has given new momentum to gender equality through the full implementation of the provisions of the Moroccan Family Code.@@@The Kingdom has also launched the first national plan of action for women, peace and security, as an integrated political framework for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), based on our belief in the importance of the full participation of women in preventing and settling conflicts.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its commitment to finding a definitive political solution to the contrived regional conflict over the Moroccan Sahara, which should be based on the Moroccan autonomy initiative as the only solution to this conflict, while respecting the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of the Kingdom.@@@Since we introduced that serious and realistic initiative in 2007, it has been supported by the Security Council and more than 90 States.@@@In the southern regions, the Kingdom is implementing a new development model launched by His Majesty in 2015.@@@All those living in the region are participating fully in every stage of its implementation through their democratically elected representatives in the local councils of the Moroccan Sahara.@@@The active participation of the inhabitants of the Moroccan Sahara in its political, social and economic aspects of life attests to their attachment to the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Moroccan Sahara.@@@In adhering to the statement made by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on the forty-sixth anniversary of the Green March, the Kingdom of Morocco reaffirms its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara to relaunch a series of round tables, in the same format and with the same participants, to reach a realistic and lasting political solution based on consensus and in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially, most recently, resolution 2602 (2021).@@@The serious and well-intentioned participation of Algeria in those round tables and the acknowledgement of its responsibility in creating and pursuing the contrived conflict will be the first prerequisite to reaching a final political settlement of the issue.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco expresses once again its deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and the absence of the rule of law in the Tindouf camps.@@@In blatant violation of international humanitarian law, Algeria has ceded its responsibilities over that part of its territory to armed separatist militias that have documented links to dangerous terrorist networks in the Sahel region.@@@We again call on the international community to urge Algeria to respond to the calls made by the Security Council since 2011 and allow the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to organize a census and register the inhabitants of the Tindouf camps.@@@In a letter that he sent on 20 December 2020 to His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine, His Majesty King Mohammed VI reiterated the steadfast position of Morocco in support of the Palestinian question, called for the implementation of two-State solution, for which there is international consensus, and reiterated Morocco’s commitment to the negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli parties as the only way to reach a final, lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict.@@@In his capacity as Chair of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, His Majesty reaffirmed that Morocco would spare no effort to preserve the historical identity of Jerusalem as a locus of coexistence and peace, continue to safeguard its special status, uphold respect for freedom of religion for the followers of the three monotheistic religions and defend the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.@@@Based on our commitment to improving the living conditions of the Palestinians, His Majesty led mediation efforts that culminated in the agreement to maintain the Allenby Bridge, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, linking the West Bank and Jordan, continuously open.@@@That will have a positive impact on the daily lives of Palestinians and facilitate the movement of people and goods.@@@Given its shared destiny with the State of Libya and in order to build on the positive momentum created by the Skhirat Agreement and Bouznika talks, the Kingdom of Morocco will pursue efforts to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict in that brotherly country, in line with His Majesty’s vision.@@@We are committed to finding a Libyan-led solution to the crisis, without any foreign interference or agenda.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the appointment of Mr. Abdullah Bathily as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, and reaffirms its full commitment to working with him and effectively contributing to efforts enabling the
Libyan stakeholders to reach the necessary agreements and organize parliamentary and presidential elections as the sole means to overcoming the current situation.@@@The scope of today’s challenges will require us to make one of two choices.@@@Either we disregard the current crises facing the world, or we intensify our efforts to address them constructively and effectively.@@@Our collective decisions will have a decisive impact on the lives of present and future generations.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco, in line with His Majesty’s vision and our actions since we joined the United Nations upon gaining independence, the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to uphold its commitments.@@@Let	me	begin by congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@I am confident that, under his able stewardship, this session will be crowned with success.@@@I also expect that the current debate will serve as a meaningful occasion for all United Nations Member States to find common solutions through exchanges of useful experiences in overcoming the existing challenges and crises and building a sustainable world for ourselves and future generations.@@@Over the three years since the outbreak of a once-in- a-century pandemic, this malignant virus has taken the precious lives of more than 6.53 million people and still poses a threat to the existence of humankind with the emergence of subvariants that are strong in transmission and immunity evasion.@@@To make matters worse, the global health crisis is compounded by newly emerging infectious diseases, such as monkeypox.@@@This year has seen immense human and material losses in all regions of the world, including South Asia, Western Europe and North America, due to the destructive effects of the disastrous abnormal weather resulting from the climate change.@@@That has created yet another difficult problem for the international community.@@@Moreover, the global security environment is plunging into its worst state since the Second World War, owing to the high-handedness and arbitrariness of some countries attempting to replace the current international order centred on the United Nations system with a “rules-based international order” governed by unilateral and exclusive Western values.@@@The United Nations was founded in reflection of the expectations and desire of humankind, which wanted to see no repetition of the scourge of the world wars that had inflicted indescribable misfortune upon them.@@@More than ever before, the present reality urgently calls for the United Nations to promote cooperation, reconciliation, unity and solidarity among its Member States, and to discharge its righteous missions and role.@@@The world has been faced with challenges and difficulties of all sorts during the past year.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was no exception.@@@Nevertheless, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has had valuable successes in protecting the life and safety of the people from the threat of a malignant pandemic and in achieving overall development of the country, while persistently overcoming the difficulties and obstacles on its own.@@@I hope that the successes and experiences gained by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will make a positive contribution to the deliberation of the theme before the current session of the General Assembly on the international community’s overcoming interlocking challenges and finding transformative solutions.@@@The unprecedented crisis caused by the malignant virus spread throughout our State beginning late last April.@@@It created a very critical ordeal and served as an occasion to test the national crisis-preparedness capacity of the country.@@@But the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Government made a correct analysis of the features of the malignant virus and the circumstances of its outbreak, together with the state of the public health of the country.@@@On that basis, it lost no time in putting forward an anti-epidemic policy in a scientific, transparent and speedy manner so as to take the strategic initiative in preventing the infectious disease, and proceeded with its implementation with due care, thereby achieving a decisive victory in exterminating the malignant virus in a very short period of 100-odd days.@@@A high sense of organization and voluntary unity of action, along with a social ethos of helping and caring about each other, reflect the superiority of the political system peculiar to our country.@@@That served as a fundamental guarantee for the successful implementation of the scientific anti-epidemic policy.@@@In terms of anti-epidemic and public health foundations, our country has been in a weaker condition than other countries, but it took the contagious disease under control in the shortest period of time.@@@All in all, that brilliant result was achieved by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Government’s correct anti-epidemic policy and superior socialist system.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Government is closely following the anti-epidemic situation in neighbouring countries and the world.@@@At the same time, it is stepping up its work to build the national anti-epidemic capacity to actively cope with any public health crisis in the present and the future and to fully secure the life and safety of the people.@@@Upon authorization, I take this opportunity to express thanks to those countries and international organizations that have shown their deep interest and willingness to render assistance to the anti-epidemic work of our country.@@@Despite the inevitable difficulties and obstacles caused by the global health crisis and abnormal weather conditions, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Government achieved new successes and progress by tirelessly propelling the efforts for national development and stabilization and the improvement of the people’s livelihood.@@@Industry, agriculture and all other sectors of the economy are following a trend of steady and stable growth, while the efforts to supply the people with modern apartments free of charge and provide the children and students all across the country with nutritious food, new school uniforms and stationery materials at the State’s expense are being carried forward as planned.@@@The subjective and objective conditions and environment are still unfavourable, but visible and substantial progress and advances are being made in our country in a social atmosphere that is full of vim and vigour.@@@That reality in our country substantiates the fact that we can successfully overcome any difficulty and challenge if we rely on the strength of the people to implement policies that suit the reality on the ground.@@@The successes of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in its national and social development were by no means achieved in a peaceful and quiet environment.@@@The security environment on the Korean peninsula is now caught up in a vicious cycle of tension and confrontation due to the increasing hostility of the United States and its following forces against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.@@@Recently, it has been heading towards a much more dangerous phase.@@@One of the foremost excuses of the United States and its servile forces to justify their hostile policy and military threats against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is none other than the possession of our self-defensive nuclear weapons.@@@A few days ago, the United States President attacked us from this very rostrum, saying that despite his country’s “efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy”, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate United Nations “sanctions” (A/77/ PV.6, p. 23).@@@To put it clearly, we have never recognized such United Nations resolutions that seek to pressure us because we do not abide by the rules made by the United States unilaterally.@@@We will not accept them in the future, either.@@@In addition to our country, there is a number of countries in the world that possess nuclear weapons, but only the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been subjected to the most brigandish and brutal sanctions resolutions.@@@That is because the United Nations connived at and allowed the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States in antagonizing the independent Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under an absurd rationale that it differs in its ideas and systems and opposes its unjust policy.@@@The United States is even now planning to conduct joint military exercises, which arose serious concern in the surroundings of the Korean peninsula.@@@Obviously, this is an extremely dangerous act of igniting the fuse to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has found another correct way to defend its sovereignty and fundamental interests from the persistent hostile policy and military threat of the United States and its following forces and to ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region.@@@At the recent seventh session of the fourteenth Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a law on the policy of the nation’s nuclear forces was adopted with unanimous approval, in reflection of the general will of all Korean people.@@@In direct proportion to the increase of the hostile policy and military blackmail of the United States against us, our strength is bound to grow continuously to contain them.@@@The United States compelled the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to adopt the law on the policy of nuclear forces in defiance of the United States hostility.@@@The United States should clearly understand that its heinous, hostile policy against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea over the past 30 years is responsible for creating today’s reality, and ask and answer itself and ponder over how far it is prepared to take this situation in the future.@@@In his policy speech delivered at the seventh session of the fourteenth Supreme People’s Assembly, Comrade Kim Jong Un, President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that the current international situation shows that the contradictions between justice and injustice and between the progressive and the reactionary, especially the power structure surrounding the Korean peninsula, have become obvious and that the change from a unipolar world advocated by the United States into a multipolar world is accelerating significantly.@@@Today the world is faced with not a few severe crises and challenges, but the most fundamental danger is the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States and its followers, which are destroying the foundation of international peace and stability in order to maintain the hegemonic unipolar world.@@@The “rules-based international order” advocated by the United States is no less than the United States-centred international order, permeated with unilateral and
hegemonic American values.@@@It is also an imperialistic power structure that gives precedence to the interests of the United States over the common interests of humankind and international law, demanding other countries’ obedience.@@@The United States, having divided the world into “democratic” and “authoritarian” States, is now forcing other countries to choose between the two and seeking bloc confrontation.@@@It attempts to maintain world hegemony by expanding the bilateral and multilateral military alliance system that is a legacy of the Cold War.@@@The prevailing reality urgently calls on the United Nations, entrusted with maintaining global peace and security and safeguarding international justice, to fully discharge its missions and role enshrined in the Charter, strictly adhering to the principles of impartiality and objectivity.@@@The United Nations is the most universal international organization, bringing together all sovereign countries.@@@As such, an individual country or a minority group can never represent the United Nations.@@@All the United Nations activities should be duly oriented to realizing the common interests and prosperity of the Member States.@@@To that end, the basic formula for solving problems should be decision-making that reflects not the individual interests of a few countries, but the legitimate and just demands and opinions of all the Member States.@@@The Security Council is the very organ where impartiality and objectivity are not ensured in United Nations activities.@@@The mere fact that the Security Council makes an issue of the exercise of the legitimate right to self-defence of a sovereign State is a contradictory act, as it denies the basic spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, which clearly stipulates sovereign equality and non-interference, as well as the recognized rules governing international relations.@@@The Security Council is not fully discharging its missions and responsibilities to safeguard international peace and security.@@@The main reason for that lies precisely in the unjust and double-dealing acts of the United States and some United Nations Member States following in the footsteps of the United States.@@@The Security Council does not say even one word about the high-handedness and arbitrariness, reckless arms build-up and war crimes of the United States, but only picks a quarrel with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at every opportunity in its righteous efforts to bolster national self-defence capabilities.@@@All of that reveals that the Security Council has lost its competency and authority to act on behalf of the United Nations Member States when it performs its duty to maintain international peace and security.@@@As long as the double standards, unfairness, highhandedness and arbitrariness of the United States are not removed, any decisions or resolutions adopted by the Security Council can neither have reasonable binding force nor contribute to ensuring global peace and security.@@@In order to put an end to the highhandedness and arbitrariness of specific countries, including the United States and restore the confidence of the international community in the Security Council, urgent priority should be given to the expansion and strengthening of representation of developing countries, which account for the absolute majority of the United Nations membership.@@@If the United Nations is to ensure impartiality and objectivity in its activities, it should adhere to the cardinal principles of respect for sovereign equality and peoples’ rights to self-determination.@@@The United States and some other United Nations Member States are trying to unilaterally impose Western values and the “rules-based international order” on sovereign States, behind the slogans of “safeguarding democracy” and “protecting human rights”.@@@Such interventionist attempt constitutes a flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter, which gives precedence to the principle of sovereign equality.@@@The partial acts and double standards favouring the unfair positions of some individual countries and specific forces should be thoroughly eliminated, and the core principles of the United Nations Charter — the sovereign equality and equal rights and self-determination of the peoples — should be strictly observed.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea delegation takes this opportunity to extend firm support and solidarity to the Government and the people of Cuba in their struggle to safeguard the sovereignty and right to development of their country in the face of the high-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States in a move to interfere in its internal affairs.@@@We also strongly demand that all the economic and financial embargoes imposed on Cuba by the United States be lifted immediately, as required by relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.@@@We also stand in firm support and solidarity with the peoples of the Syrian Arab Republic, Palestine and other independent countries that are struggling to repel the interference of foreign forces and safeguard their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@It is the unwavering foreign policy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Government to maintain independence, peace and friendship.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will broadly cooperate with all countries and nations that oppose and reject aggression and interference, domination and subordination, and aspire to independence and justice, transcending differences in ideologies and systems.@@@It will also develop multifaceted exchanges and cooperation even with capitalist countries that respect our country and take a friendly attitude to it.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea sets great store by sovereign equality and international justice.@@@Moreover, in the future it will actively join the international community in its efforts to maintain world peace and security and establish a fair and just international order.@@@It will also fulfil its responsibilities and role in ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula.@@@It is my honour and privilege to address the General Assembly for the first time as Prime Minister of Tonga.@@@I offer my warmest congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I assure him of our delegation’s full support.@@@May I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@He led a presidency of hope during unprecedented times.@@@I also wish to commend the tireless efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres.@@@I thank the Secretary-General for his leadership during these most trying times.@@@Before us is a critical, crucial theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@Our shared planet and our people face complex and multifaceted challenges, and we must act now.@@@We have the responsibility and the duty to find common ground.@@@Together, we must deliver the transformative solutions needed to build peaceful, inclusive, healthy and resilient societies — societies looking with hope to their futures because they can live in a planet we sustain in peace and health for current and future generations to come.@@@The President’s theme — our theme — is a timely and relevant theme to guide our work during this session.@@@The global challenges are vast; they are many; they are interlinked.@@@They all are ultimately about maintaining international peace and security.@@@With urgency we must, among so many other issues, overcome the severe economic, financial and social impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, and accelerate action on climate change, ocean health, energy transformation, the sustainable use of natural resources, cybersecurity — and I could go on.@@@For this we must unite, and we must be determined to work together for solutions.@@@The very peaceful existence of humankind and that of the planet hosting us are at stake.@@@We must unite to find the way forward in an equitable multilateral system and a cooperation fit for purpose, fit for the future and respectful of our differences but united by our shared desire for an inclusive, hopeful and sustainable future for all.@@@Earlier this year, Tonga co-sponsored several General Assembly resolutions in support of the people of Ukraine.@@@Tonga continues to urge a peaceful resolution of the conflict to save unnecessary loss of lives and minimize any further devastations.@@@Tonga is far from this conflict, yet its ripple effects are felt by all of us.@@@Tonga, like so many others, is faced with higher costs of fuel, food, and basic supplies.@@@Inflation is double-digit.@@@These are inflation rates that we have not experienced in decades.@@@More than ever, it is urgent that we progress toward implementing the goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development set seven years ago.@@@At half-time, the reality is that the existential threats posed by climate change, pandemics and conflict have increased.@@@This is not some temporary inconvenience.@@@This is about our survival.@@@Let us admit that situations have worsened since we last met.@@@This is also why we thank the Secretary- General for his Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022.@@@I believe that it provides a road map out of crisis.@@@The promises of the global agenda we agreed to risks becoming promises we did not keep.@@@We must keep our promises, especially to the vulnerable populations such as those of small island developing States (SIDS).@@@We must focus.@@@There are areas which need immediate action to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and deliver meaningful progress for people and the planet by 2030.@@@The successor agreement to the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the Samoa Pathway, will be critical, notably in regard to the support by the international community for small island developing States.@@@SIDS are and must remain a special case for development.@@@We are not a footnote; we face unique vulnerabilities.@@@Once again, it is with urgency that we call on all States to show solidarity with the peoples of the SIDS.@@@We call on their support especially during the preparatory process for the SAMOA successor arrangement.@@@Only a few short years remain to implement the Samoa Pathway.@@@Tonga welcomes the Secretariat’s work on a monitoring framework for the SAMOA Pathway implementation.@@@Already, three decades have elapsed since small island developing States called for an index recognizing our special circumstances and vulnerabilities.@@@The international financial system has used measures not necessarily adapted to our special circumstances, our challenges and our ecological and economic vulnerabilities.@@@This has limited our access to appropriate financing, debt relief and aid.@@@Greater responsiveness to our special circumstances has come about over time as the unique factors affecting the entire range of our political, social, economic and environmental development issues have been taken into account.@@@We express appreciation to the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and the United Nations high-level panel of experts on a multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI) for the release of the interim report on the development of the MVI.@@@We look forward to its finalization and adoption by December 2022.@@@Tonga, like so many of our Pacific neighbours, faces natural disasters of unprecedented severity and frequency.@@@That threatens our very existence, and certainly our efforts for the inclusive and sustainable development of a small economy like Tonga’s.@@@All Tongans will forever recall 15 January 2022.@@@The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted.@@@The explosion was of an intensity so great that some research compares it to the impact of a nuclear explosion.@@@We made the news of the world — not the news we looked for.@@@Research documents that the explosion may have created a tsunami almost as high as the Statue of Liberty.@@@Plumes of hot gas, ash and water vapour were projected into the atmosphere, reaching a height of 36 miles.@@@The ensuing tsunami devastated our economy.@@@Several islands were completely or severely destroyed.@@@People were displaced and then evacuated to neighbouring islands.@@@The volcanic eruption and tsunami cut access to basics for people and cut a precious lifeline for an island nation — our communications.@@@The widespread economic and social damage and, sadly, loss of lives are estimated by the World Bank at 36.4 per cent of Tonga’s gross domestic product (GDP).@@@In our hour of need, we recognize with our deepest appreciation the response of Member States and their peoples.@@@We recognize the support of philanthropic institutions, the United Nations system and other intergovernmental organizations, development partners, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and individuals.@@@We thank them — malo ‘aupito — for standing in solidarity with Tonga ain our hour of difficulty.@@@My Government has renewed our national priorities.@@@We must build back better and build national resilience to external threats and risks.@@@We improve the quality of services and affordability to the community and achieve progressive and sustainable economic growth.@@@We are committed to reducing the risks and harmful effects of natural disasters, particularly through risk- informed development efforts and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response.@@@In February of this year, after two years of keeping COVID-19 at bay through the closure of our border, Tonga experienced its first community outbreak.@@@Over the previous two years, we had vaccinated our people.@@@We now have 90 per cent fully vaccinated.@@@I must thank Tonga’s development partners for providing support, both directly and through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility.@@@We also acknowledge the support provided by UNICEF and the World Health Organization on infection, prevention, control, risk communication and surveillance.@@@That support was critical to Tonga’s preparedness and response plan.@@@Finally, on 1 August, we were able to again open our borders.@@@We did so emphasizing preventative health measures to mitigate risks and ensure a safe reopening.@@@Tonga has one of the world’s highest rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) globally.@@@NCDs, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers and diabetes account for approximately 80 per cent of deaths in Tonga.@@@We must provide continuous support to meet our current goal, in line with the SDG of reducing NCD- related deaths by one third by the year 2030.@@@Climate change continues to be the single greatest existential threat facing the blue Pacific.@@@The adverse impacts of climate change make Tonga the third most vulnerable country in the world.@@@That threatens our territorial integrity, land, water, health, infrastructure, food security, biological diversity, livelihoods and ecosystems.@@@It threatens our peoples’ mental health and sense of nationhood.@@@Climate change is an existential threat to people and our desire for international peace and security.@@@We must limit global warming to 1.5°C.@@@We reiterate our call for this issue to be a permanent item on the Security Council’s agenda.@@@The Security Council must be seized of the matter because of its clear links to traditional threats to international peace and security.@@@Whether it is sea-level rise, loss of territory or the mass migration it leads to, this is a trigger for violence and a threat to peace and security.@@@Tonga is a small island developing State, but it is also a large ocean State.@@@Some 99 per cent of our sovereign territory is the ocean, and through generations we have borne our serious responsibility to protect the ocean.@@@The ocean is our beating heart; it serves as the foundation of our economy and the lifeline for sectors from tourism to fisheries to ocean transport and international shipping.@@@The conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources are at the forefront of our concerns and interests.@@@Tonga joins Member States that have argued for the importance of the ocean and seas to global sustainable development.@@@Tonga aspires to play its role in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities, particularly in responding to mitigating IUU risks.@@@We must achieve the goals outlined in SDG 14 if we are to survive.@@@Anything less is unacceptable, and we must do whatever we can within our available resources.@@@We were pleased to participate in the seventh Our Ocean Conference in Koror, Palau, and in the second United Nations Ocean Conference, held
in Lisbon, and we look forward to continuing such conferences to ensure that the oceans and seas are a priority in the global sustainable development agenda.@@@It is through such engagement that partnerships were formed and resulted in Tonga producing its first-ever Tonga Ocean Management Plan in 2021.@@@Tonga continues to recognize the importance of the legal mandate provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).@@@As a member of the International Seabed Authority, Tonga continuously engages in the work of the Authority.@@@We must expeditiously conclude those exploitation regulations that will ensure that appropriate conservation and environmental management practices are in place when exploitation activities begin.@@@The conservation and protection of our high seas remain a priority for Tonga.@@@I refer in particular to the negotiations to conclude an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Tonga is optimistic that the considerable amount of work that has gone into this process, along with further progress on resolving key issues of divergence, will enable us to come to a positive conclusion.@@@Let us conclude this historical instrument to support our obligations under UNCLOS.@@@Tonga has a large proportion of our people living in diasporas near and far, with two out of three Tongans living overseas.@@@Remittances equal some 40 per cent of GDP.@@@This is why it is of concern to us to find ways to reduce the cost of remittances.@@@I am honoured to be appointed President of the sixth session of the Assembly of SIDS DOCK.@@@In this capacity, I launched the Global Ocean Energy Alliance (GLOEA) on 29 June in Lisbon.@@@GLOEA is an initiative focused on accelerating the development of ocean energy technologies and projects through partnerships that mobilize technical, human and financial resources and are aimed establishing a global community of shared interest — a community capable of developing a pipeline of bankable ocean energy projects to serve islands, cities and coastal nations.@@@As the events of 2022 have so cruelly shown us, internet connectivity is a lifeline for Tonga.@@@Our economy and our society are dependent on well-functioning domestic and international communications.@@@The security required to protect such connectivity is therefore vital to our sustainable development.@@@In this regard, I wish to recognize the work of New Zealand, Australia and the International Telecommunication Union/UNESCO@@@Broadband Commission.@@@Education is at the core of peace and sustainable futures.@@@Tonga recognizes and welcomes the opportunity to share in the Transforming Education Summit, held earlier this week.@@@The Summit provided an opportunity to once again reiterate our collective call to put education front and centre for inclusive and sustainable development for all.@@@We must build future-proof, sustainable and resilient education systems.@@@To that end, we must scale up financial investment.@@@Pacific Islands Forum leaders have committed to strong regional action for a shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean.@@@They endorse the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@The Pacific Ocean covers one third of our planet’s surface, and it is our desire to act as one blue Pacific continent.@@@We continue to note with grave concern the threat posed by sea- level rise to our blue Pacific.@@@We commit ourselves to ensuring that climate change-induced sea-level rise does not challenge our maritime zones delineated under UNCLOS, as reflected in the 2021 Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-Related Sea-Level Rise.@@@We note the invaluable work of the International Law Commission, in particular the Study Group on sea-level rise, for its work in advancing deliberations on this topic with a view to strengthening the UNCLOS framework, particularly in addressing the modern realities of sea-level rise.@@@We further note the high debt sustainability analysis of Forum island countries and emphasize the need for debt instruments to be simple, manageable and implementable, given countries’ limited resources, the time-bound nature of debt instruments and the increasingly constrained development finance landscape worldwide.@@@We also committed to revitalizing the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration in 2023.@@@Our Pacific collective will remain and remains our strength in our advocacy for faster and more action by the international community.@@@Vanuatu’s initiative to seek an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligations of states under international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse impacts of climate change in order to clarify the legal consequences of climate change.@@@Tonga has joined all of the other Pacific Leaders in supporting
that initiative, which is a step in the right direction.@@@The initiative of Tuvalu and Antigua and Barbuda to establish a commission of SIDs on climate change and international law that will be tasked with developing and implementing fair and just global environmental norms and practices is also a step in the right direction.@@@I conclude by reiterating Tonga’s support for President Korosi’s important work.@@@May we show resolve, courage and partnership to meet the challenges before us and turn the needle to hope for present and future generations.@@@May God guide and bless the General Assembly and all its members, observers and staff in our shared journey during this session to the destination of finding solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science.@@@I bring the General Assembly warm greetings from the paradise in our backyards, the Federated States of Micronesia.@@@It is my honour to address the General Assembly, and in doing so I bring a warm kaselehlie on behalf of my delegation and the leadership and the people of the Federated States of Micronesia to all Member States in attendance today and those joining us virtually from across the globe.@@@I express my country’s gratitude as we join other members of the Assembly in extending our heartiest congratulations to the President on his election.@@@We also wish to thank his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his excellent leadership.@@@I would also like to pay our respects to Secretary- General Antonio Guterres, who continues to demonstrate dedication and integrity in his role as Secretary-General of this — our — United Nations.@@@I will begin by reiterating that the Federated States of Micronesia’s foreign policy is to be a friend to all and an enemy to none; that we extend to all peoples and nations that which we seek: peace, friendship, cooperation and love in our common humanity.@@@As leaders of the world, it is our duty and obligation to take bold decisions and actions that serve our citizens and reflect our values.@@@Every person in this Hall and beyond is impacted, in some form or another, by the brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.@@@The unprovoked attack against the people of Ukraine by another Member of the United Nations is illegal, blatantly disregards international laws and norms and undermines the Charter of the United Nations, whose purposes and principles are to maintain international peace and security.@@@I join Secretary of State Blinken of the United States and the members of the Security Council in imploring Russia at their recent meeting to stop the threat of nuclear war.@@@The people and the Government of Micronesia support the people and the Government of Ukraine in their quest to defend their families and their homes.@@@Micronesia strongly encourages all other peoples and Governments, most particularly those with greater influence and means, to firmly stand with the people and the Government of Ukraine and show that the people of the twenty-first century cannot and will not tolerate aggressive and violent behaviour.@@@An infringement on the rights of one is an infringement on the rights of us all, and we do well to stand with our neighbours — lest we one day find ourselves standing alone.@@@While traditional security concerns have taken much of our world’s attention in recent memory, for Micronesia, as a Pacific island country, it must continue to be emphasized that the most enduring security threat to the Pacific and the world is in the form of anthropogenic climate change.@@@The Federated States of Micronesia makes its most urgent appeal to the global community, especially the developed countries, to commit to the intent of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by providing adequate, accessible and concessional financing for climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as for loss and damage.@@@On loss and damage specifically, Micronesia calls for the adoption of an agenda item at the twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27) on a loss and damage response fund, the establishment of that fund at COP 27 and the full operationalization of the fund to be completed at COP 28.@@@The Federated States of Micronesia cannot overemphasize the extreme urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5°C through rapid, deep and sustained reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@However, to the extent that mitigation, as well as adaptation, are not sufficient to avert or minimize loss and damage, financing must be provided with all due haste to help vulnerable communities, like those of my country, to recover from climate change-related loss and damage.@@@Current efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions remain wholly inadequate.@@@The world is moving past 1.5°C of warming and is rapidly speeding towards and will soon exceed 1.5°C.@@@Despite warnings of dangerous feedback and tipping points, many actors still continue to engage in the worst carbon-emitting activities.@@@They ignore the solutions that could address climate while supporting development goals in favour of business as usual.@@@Fortunately, the tide is changing on CO- emissions, but still too slowly.@@@Moreover, research shows that efforts to reduce CO2 alone will not cool the planet in the short term.@@@Only the mitigation of methane, which is a super pollutant and the second-most potent greenhouse gas, and of the other short-lived climate pollutants can prevent the world from exceeding the 2.0°C upper limit over the next two decades.@@@We need a new and robust methane agreement, which is currently not addressed sufficiently in the existing legal framework.@@@Doing so is key to ensuring that countries can put their adaptation plans in place while additional CO2 mitigation gets under way.@@@Micronesia urges all countries to commit to the Kigali Amendment and the Global Methane Pledge to see a 30 per cent reduction of methane emissions from 2020 levels by 2030.@@@In that connection, I congratulate the United States on the ratification of the Kigali Amendment by the United States Senate yesterday.@@@That is indeed a monumental step towards curbing climate super pollutants.@@@I urge other countries to take that important step forward to collectively secure a livable planet for all of us and for future generations.@@@I look forward to working closely with the United States and others in fully implementing the amendment.@@@This is my fourth address to the Assembly.@@@In my previous three addresses, I urged the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China to consider climate change a non-political and non-competitive issue for cooperation, because solving the climate change crisis ultimately requires both of those superpowers to work together.@@@For the briefest period of time, it seemed as if the Americans, with whom Micronesia shares an enduring partnership, and the Chinese, with whom Micronesia shares a great friendship, were starting to work together on that issue despite increases in tension in other areas.@@@Now they are no longer speaking to each other on that important issue.@@@Micronesia cannot understand why our partners and friends cannot get along on an issue of total international importance, but one way to get attention and action is to explicitly call out your closest friends and allies by name instead of talking around the substance.@@@Indeed, President Xi and President Biden are both friends of Micronesia.@@@I respect both of them and their peoples and their countries.@@@As the two super-Powers in this world, they both set the tone and cadence of global
conversations.@@@It is my wish that they can respect each other so that they can see with their eyes wide open that it is Micronesia’s strongest desire and the desire of the rest of the Pacific island countries that they resume cooperation on tackling climate change.@@@Micronesia says that to each of them bilaterally and at the General Assembly multilaterally, in the quietest conversations in the President’s Office and in the loudest conversations streamed across the world, because it is our most important issue.@@@Their capacity to cooperate on climate change is necessary to ensure that our world is habitable for future generations and does not suffer from civilizational collapse.@@@Ours is undoubtedly an interdependent world, in which we share common goals for sustainability.@@@I am of the view that, through cooperation, we have a better chance of building healthy societies that we can proudly pass on to our children and a world that values the rights of every individual and every society.@@@I want to personally thank the leadership of this Organization and its Members for the support extended to my country in establishing the Multi-Country Office for the North Pacific.@@@I am proud to announce that the establishment of the Multi-Country Office has added value to our response to the coronavirus disease and accessing available funding sources and technical support through the United Nations system.@@@Small island developing States (SIDS) such as Micronesia are in dire need of support from our partners to support our country-driven development strategy.@@@Distance continues to be a challenge in providing service delivery.@@@In view of the efforts provided by the Multi-Country Office, I wish to acknowledge and commend the United Nations agencies for their diligent work in making sure that they reach every island in my country and in the Micronesia subregion, including the vulnerable outlying islands.@@@While acknowledging our interest in strengthening our tourism sector and developing value-added agricultural products, investment in the blue economy is our main aim.@@@To that end, our Government works closely with the private sector for the benefit of all.@@@Sustainable fisheries management and the protection of the environment are therefore essential in our endeavour to sustain marine life for our future generations.@@@In 2022, we have focused a substantial amount of work on oceans, with mixed results.@@@While the Our Ocean Conference, held in Palau, and the Ocean Conference, held in Lisbon, both concluded with successful outcomes, critical work remains to be done to fully protect the ocean resources considered a common heritage of humankind.@@@In March, as the international community, we were unable to finalize an international legally binding instrument to conserve and sustainably use the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Just last month, we had to pause the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) because we ran out of allotted time.@@@It is imperative that we finalize that work as soon as possible so that we can protect ocean resources effectively.@@@Micronesia looks forward to the resumption and conclusion of the BBNJ negotiations very soon.@@@This past summer, Micronesia announced that we were joining the Alliance of Countries for a Deep- Sea Mining Moratorium, alongside a number of fellow Pacific SIDS.@@@It is the view of Micronesia that deep seabed mining in the international seabed area should not occur until the precautionary principle, the ecosystem approach and the polluter-pays principle have been implemented.@@@In the area of the international seabed, no such implementation can take place in the absence of the finalization of a robust, responsible and comprehensive set of exploitation regulations by the International Seabed Authority.@@@To do otherwise would be a dereliction of our duty to protect and preserve the marine environment and respect the common heritage of humankind.@@@Turning to the maritime areas within our national jurisdiction, the vast expanse of Micronesia’s maritime zones represents both an opportunity and at the same time an enormous challenge.@@@We have some of the largest fishing grounds in the Pacific, covering an area of 1.1 million square miles, and one of the most productive tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific.@@@Our maritime zones are exposed to threats of transnational crime, illegal activities and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.@@@We need our partners to support us in capacity-building efforts for strengthened law enforcement in the areas of maritime surveillance, money-laundering and terrorist financing, drug trafficking and other transnational crimes.@@@We are thankful to Australia for donating two Guardian-Class patrol boats, as well as to Japan for complementing those assets with four smaller patrol boats for nearby coastal waters.@@@We recognize the
United States Coast Guard as an enduring partner in protecting our expansive ocean territory.@@@But given our vast exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelves, which reach beyond 200 nautical miles, we invite additional countries to assist us in acquiring more assets with much more advanced maritime surveillance capabilities, such as drones and submersibles.@@@Our law enforcement, border management and maritime surveillance teams would benefit from more partnership in capacity-building and support for continually enhancing their law enforcement skills.@@@Speaking further of the common heritage of humankind, Micronesia wishes to express its gravest concern about Japan’s decision to discharge, as of next year, nuclear-contaminated water, otherwise known as advanced liquid processing system water, into the Pacific Ocean.@@@We cannot close our eyes to the unimaginable threats of nuclear contamination, marine pollution and the eventual destruction of the Blue Pacific continent.@@@The impacts of that decision are both transboundary and intergenerational in nature.@@@As Micronesia’s Head of State, I cannot allow the destruction of our ocean resources that support the livelihood of our people.@@@The leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum face the future with a lot of optimism.@@@As leaders, through the Suva Agreement, we adopted key structural reforms for the Forum that strengthen our region, including reforms on the selection and subregional rotation of the Secretary General position, the hosting of a subregional office of the Forum in Micronesia, the hosting of the Office of the Pacific Ocean Commissioner in Micronesia and the filling of the head of that office in Micronesia.@@@We are implementing those reforms in good faith to strengthen unity among the Pacific nations as one family.@@@We also adopted the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, which we just launched this afternoon in New York.@@@It represents an important bridge into the future — a unique opportunity for our region to develop long-term approaches to address our common challenges.@@@The solidarity of our region will strengthen our collective sense of Pacific regionalism and the security of the Blue Pacific continent, and we therefore ask our partners to assist us — and not to divide us in any way.@@@The key message for the United Nations and all countries in the world that engage with the Pacific is that Micronesia and the rest of the Pacific Islands Forum solicit all countries that engage with the Pacific to support and respect the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@It is the Pacific region’s road map for sustainable development and growth and the security of current and future generations.@@@We can succeed in implementing it only if we work together with the support of our international partners.@@@I wish to conclude by explicitly calling on all peoples and nations who hear me today to know that the people and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia extend to them peace, friendship, cooperation and love in our common humanity.@@@We need Member States — all of them — to stand with us as nations united.@@@To my fellow world leaders: we must take action and make bold decisions today.@@@Our actions today will be our global prosperity tomorrow.@@@Allow me at the outset, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Cameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, who has done me the signal honour of representing him at these important meetings, to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi, as well as the other members of his Bureau, on his outstanding election as President of this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I take this opportunity to assure him of the support of the Cameroonian delegation in achieving the objectives he has set.@@@I would also like to commend his predecessor, Minister Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, for the availability and efficiency with which he carried out his mandate throughout the seventy-sixth session.@@@Finally, allow me to reiterate our appreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres who, despite the challenges and difficult times of the hour, has managed to stay the course by engaging with courage, determination and dedication in the defence of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The President has proposed that this general debate be structured around the theme entitled “A watershed moment: transformative solutions in the face of intricate challenges”.@@@That theme comes at the right time, in a particularly difficult context where the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has, for nearly three years, continued to affect the course and management of world affairs, whose complexity at the global, regional, subregional and national levels no longer needs to be demonstrated.@@@At the political level, rivalries for power, interest and hegemony are growing all over the world.@@@As a corollary, the arms race is intensifying and continuing to entrench itself, especially on the seas and oceans and in outer space.@@@Many hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world are the main theatres of operations where these shocks are felt, the waves and collateral effects of which amplify the threats and suffering that were already weighing heavy on peoples and nations in terms of loss of human life, material loss, migration, the deterioration of the environment, the disruption of financial systems, and food and energy crises, to name but a few.@@@That is the case in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe that we have been witnessing for more than six months.@@@Indeed, the Cameroonian Government is following with the greatest attention the conflict situation between Ukraine and Russia.@@@As members know, the peaceful settlement of disputes between States has always been one of the fundamental principles of my country’s foreign policy.@@@In that respect, Cameroon has, from the start of the crisis, reiterated its position by calling on the two parties to open negotiations with a view to reaching a joint solution so that the ideals of peace, security and sustainable development that underpin our Organization may prevail.@@@On the African continent too, hotbeds of tension persist.@@@In our efforts to find solutions, we unfortunately see that some of our partners very often come up with preconceived recipes for everything and everyone.@@@Faced with these trends, which continue year after year, it is important that the voice of Africa be heeded and supported, especially when it is raised by the African Union.@@@Economically, socially and culturally, the improvement observed before the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually giving way to a slowdown and even a decline in the progress and hope born of the courageous measures taken at the level multilateral and national since the early 2000s.@@@From a legal point of view, international commitments are no longer being met or are being met in dribs and drabs, due to selfishness, insufficient political will and even the crisis in multilateralism.@@@In such a context, it is no exaggeration to affirm that the fate of our species and the destiny of humankind are at stake.@@@The very first global and urgent challenge of the hour is the climate crisis.@@@No one is ignorant of the fact that the climate is changing, the cycle of the seasons is out of order and fires are increasing, as are unprecedented floods and hurricanes in various parts of the world.@@@Temperatures are reaching worrying levels; bodies of water, like Lake Chad, a source of life and prosperity for local populations, are reduced to their bare minimum.@@@This is the time to call for compliance with the commitments made within the framework of the various international conferences dedicated to climate change.@@@It is therefore more than urgent that action be taken to finalize the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, particularly with regard to mobilizing financial resources in favour of developing countries and to raising our ambitions for the global climate.@@@The twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled to be held in Egypt late this year, is of crucial importance in that regard.@@@It must provide urgent and decisive answers for the survival of the planet and better address that concern with innovative technologies.@@@The fight against climate change is a fight we all must wage on behalf of us all and every day.@@@It is a truly universal responsibility.@@@Aware of this major challenge and its responsibilities, Cameroon has made a commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and has set up an appropriate legal and institutional framework to that end.@@@Thanks to the forest massif of the Congo basin, one of the ecological lungs of the globe, the countries of Central Africa, united in the Central African Forest Commission, are making a major contribution to the search for solutions to climate change throughout the world.@@@They ask in return that sufficient financial and technological resources, regularly promised by developed countries, be granted to them to enable them to keep, maintain and regenerate that important ecological basin.@@@The same is true of the funding needed to implement projects designed as part of the Green Sahel initiative or the restoration of the Lake Chad basin.@@@Moreover, on the occasion of the revision of its nationally determined contribution, Cameroon has confirmed its commitment to this international momentum by increasing its greenhouse gas reduction commitments from 32 per cent to 35 per cent, 12 per cent of which are unconditional and 23 per cent of which are conditioned on the support of the international community for our efforts to address climate change.@@@For Cameroon, the fight against climate change is seen as a development opportunity and not as an insurmountable challenge.@@@Each country holds one of the digits of the access code to the new era in which the planet aspires to breathe newly clean air, without carbon but rich in oxygen.@@@The younger generations challenge us and call us to more action and not to wishful thinking.@@@Like other priority threats, the migration issue is acute.@@@Despite the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and despite the efforts also made by host countries and development partners, millions of people continue to flee their homes and homelands to live in deplorable, inhuman conditions due to conflicts, cataclysms and multiple calamities.@@@Faced with the magnitude of a human tragedy that challenges our collective conscience, we have the historic responsibility to act.@@@And my country does not intend to shy away from it.@@@Faithful to its centuries-old tradition of tolerance and hospitality, Cameroon has always been a land of welcome, transit and mixing of peoples.@@@Because of its stability, it represents a safe haven for many populations in search of peace.@@@As all know, Cameroon currently hosts more than half a million refugees and asylum- seekers, which ranks it nineteenth among refugee hosting countries in the world.@@@In addition to the tripartite conventions signed with the UNHCR and the countries concerned to promote the return and resettlement of refugees in their countries of origin, my country last April hosted the Regional Ministerial Conference on Solutions in the Context of Forced Displacement related to the Central African crisis.@@@The Conference was mandated by the Yaounde Declaration, which proposes common and inclusive solutions in favour of forcibly displaced Central Africans.@@@My country plays an active part in all these initiatives, in accordance with the Global Compact on Refugees.@@@At a completely different level, we must also deplore the persistence of terrorism and violent extremism, the effects of which continue to weigh on the world order.@@@Many regions are suffering from the resurgence of subversive operations carried out mainly by terrorist organizations, such as Boko Haram, which is rampant in the Lake Chad basin.@@@The northern part of Cameroon has been badly affected.@@@Faced with the danger and exponential advance of terrorism in various regions of the globe, my country renews its call for the strengthening of joint combat strategies.@@@Such pooling of efforts is aimed at waging a true fight against that threat in all its forms and in all its manifestations, strengthening the capacities of the sovereign States that are its victims, tracking down its financing sources and neutralizing them, and amending and activating international and regional agreements for the uncompromising repression of ever-evolving terrorism.@@@The international community must continue to play its part, in strict respect for the sovereignty of States, in rebuilding and strengthening the fragile stability in all of these areas.@@@We thank our bilateral and multilateral partners that are assisting the Joint Multinational Force established by the countries of the Lake Chad basin to combat and eradicate Boko Haram.@@@That assistance deserves to be increased, given not only the proliferation of regional terrorist groups affiliated with the Islamic State, but also the increasingly sophisticated means of these small groups, whose numbers are constantly growing, owing to the enlistment of ex-combatants from former terrorist hotbeds that have been more or less pacified.@@@It is imperative that the international community continue to invest in the fight against poverty and inequality.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reinforced by the Secretary-General’s report, Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), must be actively supported and fully implemented.@@@What is most lacking at the moment for the execution of that programme are financial and technological means, as well as synergy among the partners involved in its execution.@@@Cameroon is very committed to that path, as demonstrated by the recent submission of its voluntary national programme at the High-level Political Forum of the Economic and Social Council.@@@Because of its commitment to peace, its territorial integrity and its policy of national integration, the Government of my country continues to show openness and dialogue to put an end to the sociopolitical crisis in the regions of North-West and South-West.@@@Thus, after convening the great national dialogue in 2019, we continued the process of accelerating and deepening decentralization.@@@The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration centres created in those regions and in that of the Far North, host and train in various trades a large number of my young compatriots who have laid down their arms and renounced violence.@@@The State exercises its sovereign prerogatives throughout the national territory.@@@The Government’s current challenge is to pursue the implementation of the reconstruction of the affected regions through the humanitarian emergency plan and the development plan, drawn up in consultation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for the socioeconomic restoration of the regions, aforementioned.@@@At this point, I would like to sincerely salute the dynamic action and contribution of the UNDP in that regard and take this opportunity to thank our bilateral and multilateral partners that contribute to those various mechanisms, which are effective tools in the building of peace in Cameroon.@@@I also make a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize more actively in favour of these plans in order to allow my country to remain the haven of peace that it has always been.@@@In general, regionalization in my country is under way and helping to strengthen the participation of Cameroonians in the management of the affairs of their country.@@@These advances demonstrate that Cameroon is committed, irreversibly and resolutely, to the methodical completion of the democratic project it has set itself, and which responds to the legitimate wishes of the Cameroonian people and its project of economic revival by 2035.@@@In this, Cameroon promotes in all circumstances, through structures created to that end, a constructive and regular dialogue between the various sociological components of its population, as well as the members of its diaspora, with a view to their mobilization for the immense and exhilarating national construction process.@@@Cameroon is firmly committed to and supportive of a reformed and reinvigorated international order and genuine multilateralism based on the ideals, purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations by the founding fathers of our Organization.@@@This is why we support all the reforms currently under way within the United Nations aimed at establishing a more representative, fairer and more effective Security Council.@@@In this regard and within the framework of the democratization of United Nations institutions, Cameroon reiterates its adherence to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration unanimously adopted by African Heads of State.@@@In conclusion, Cameroon reaffirms its support for all reforms in progress aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly, strengthening the Economic and Social Council and streamlining the Secretariat, following the agenda adopted by the States Members of our Organization in order to consolidate its stature, its dimension and its capacity to better face the global challenges of our era.@@@At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid on his effective leadership of the work of the seventy-sixth session of our Assembly.@@@I also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, his successor, on his brilliant election and to assure him of the solidarity of the Comoros as he carries out his mission.@@@I also thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his sustained investment, as well as that of all his teams, in the service of peace and development.@@@The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a particularly delicate moment in the life of the international community.@@@The face of the world is changing profoundly from one year to the next.@@@Indeed, three years ago our countries entered the worst health crisis in their history, marked by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@The pandemic, as the Assembly knows, has brought all the countries of the world to their knees and demonstrated that, big or small, we are all equal in the face of the epidemiological threat that today is one of the worst situations facing our global village.@@@In that regard, the Union of the Comoros wishes once again to express its thanks and appreciation to all those who have worked tirelessly to provide, in just a few months, effective solutions that make it possible to restore hope in the world and to gradually emerge from this crisis that has seriously shaken the world’s economies.@@@As if all that were not enough, another crisis, caused by the invasion of Ukraine, has revealed once again, and in a dramatic way, the fragility of the multilateral system that brings us together today.@@@With each passing day we are seeing the price of wheat and other food products increase to unprecedented levels, which jeopardizes food security by increasing the threats of shortage and famine.@@@That is why my country condemns in the strongest terms this anachronistic invasion and urges the international community to convince Russia and Ukraine to resume as soon as possible the path of dialogue and mutual respect, the only things capable of opening the way to the cessation of hostilities.@@@I would also like to welcome last July’s Black Sea Grain Initiative, carried out under the auspices of President
Erdogan of Tiirkiye and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and aimed at allowing the export of millions of tons of grain blocked in Ukrainian ports.@@@Those agreements, which ought to be consolidated, are proof that dialogue can and must always prevail to prevent the world from plunging into chaos and misery.@@@In addition to concerns related to the ongoing conflicts and health and food crises, the community of nations must continue its quest for appropriate solutions to political and territorial problems related to the sovereignty of States and the dignity of nations.@@@In that respect, I reiterate here, on behalf of my delegation, the imperative need to find a rapid, just and equitable solution to the flagrant injustice that Palestine is suffering.@@@We must indeed find a solution that enshrines the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in perfect security and harmony with the State of Israel because, as the Comorian adage says, “we choose our friends, but we do not choose our neighbours”.@@@With regard to the question of the Moroccan Sahara, I reiterate the unfailing support of the Union of the Comoros for the principle of Moroccan rule over the Sahara.@@@The Moroccan autonomy initiative, within the framework of the sovereignty of the Cherifian Kingdom, is, in our eyes, the best basis for reaching a timely, pragmatic and lasting solution to that regional conflict, which has gone on for far too long.@@@My Government therefore strongly encourages dialogue between our two brotherly countries, Morocco and Algeria, and welcomes all initiatives likely to contribute to ensuring peace in that region, in particular the relaunch of the political process, based on Security Council resolutions.@@@In the same vein, with respect to the sovereignty of States, the Union of the Comoros reiterates its position on the need for the People’s Republic of China to recover its integrity with respect to the Chinese province of Taiwan.@@@In that context and given the threats that weigh on world peace today, which everyone recognizes and understands, my Government invites all parties involved in the various conflicts to show restraint and a spirit of responsibility.@@@With regard to the highly worrisome situation in the Sahel, we know from experience how dangerous it is to allow hotbeds of tension to arise and become fertile ground for the expansion of international terrorism.@@@My Government is all the more attentive to this issue as we have seen the rise in power in southern Africa of the barbaric Al-Shabaab phenomenon, which constitutes
a threat on land and at sea for the entire continent.@@@I reaffirm, as I did last year before the Assembly (see A/76/PV.10), that these groups threatening peace in the world are not Muslims.@@@They are quite simply terrorists who have nothing to do with Islam, which is a religion of peace, tolerance and coexistence.@@@However, we are aware that behind these contemporary terrorist phenomena, which we must fight vigorously, there is also a great deal of frustration among young people who have no points of reference and are in search of a future.@@@In that regard, I appeal to the great Powers of this world and recall that while their support is an essential contribution to the economic and social development of the States under the greatest threat, said support should be designed in such a way as to also meet the aspirations of the peoples that benefit from it.@@@I am convinced that nothing beats prevention when it comes to building peace, security and stability in the world.@@@The only way is to manage the complex issues that threaten world peace at their earliest stages, through dialogue and diplomacy.@@@I cannot talk about conflicts without mentioning the territorial dispute between my country and France concerning the Comorian island of Mayotte.@@@My Government, like all those that have preceded it, solemnly recalls before the Assembly, and in accordance with international law, Comorian sovereignty over this island, which was removed from Comorian rule during the decolonization process of our country.@@@The management of this painful dossier, which has lasted for more than 40 years, is very fortunately seeing new perspectives open up with the spirit of dialogue that has been created between the Comorian and French parties.@@@The principles and values of the United Nations are now gathered around the Sustainable Development Goals, which each country has made a priority.@@@It should be recalled that climate change is one of the important elements of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@However, entire regions are simply destined to disappear, while others are daily subject to the intensification of climate phenomena, such as floods, intense droughts, fires, coastal erosion or the acidification of the oceans.@@@While these disasters spare no country or region, it should be emphasized that the case of island developing States like the Comoros is even more worrisome and deserves greater attention from us leaders.@@@I also take this opportunity to renew our condolences, support and sympathy to the authorities and the people of Pakistan, and through them, to the bereaved families and the victims of the heavy floods that have affected this brotherly country.@@@Our States are also confronting other dangerous phenomena, such as piracy, pollution, illegal fishing, the plunder of resources at sea, human trafficking and drug trafficking, which require our utmost attention.@@@My Government joins all regional and global initiatives in waging a merciless fight against these barbaric acts, which are one of the major threats to the security of property and people.@@@That is why I have always attached great importance to the security dimension in our geostrategic action, particularly in the Mozambique Channel area and the south-west Indian Ocean region.@@@My country, the Union of the Comoros, has just celebrated 47 years of independence.@@@Although the first two decades following that regained freedom were marred by political unrest, turmoil and instability, the country has enjoyed peace and stability for more than 20 years now.@@@It is therefore necessary to do everything possible to consolidate and perpetuate this newfound political stability because it constitutes a real guarantee of socioeconomic development.@@@Our salvation lies, in fact, in a peaceful, united society that is increasingly inclusive of all the structures that make it up.@@@Thus, with a view to better national cohesion and mid-mandate, last February we held a national political dialogue aimed at bringing together more Comorian men and women around essential objectives, including peace, security and national unity, with a view to sustainable socioeconomic development.@@@The Assembly will understand why I wish to thank all the partners who were kind enough to lend their support to that dialogue.@@@I remain convinced that all the vital forces of the nation that took part in that important meeting will work towards the consolidation of the achievements of the past 20 years, in terms of human rights and the democratic transfer of power, and thereby advance the development of the country.@@@With regard to human rights, allow me to emphasize that my country works closely with the relevant regional and international bodies and has successfully passed the four-year universal periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council in 2019.@@@The constitutional and legislative reforms carried out confirm my country’s desire to make human rights a national priority.@@@With respect to social outcomes and all other areas, COVID-19 has been a concern and forced countries to prioritize its management.@@@The Union of the Comoros experienced two waves, the second of which proved to be more virulent, claiming many victims.@@@Nevertheless, the situation in the country has been brought under control thanks to forethought and the provisions taken by the authorities in that respect, and with the support of our bilateral and multilateral partners, the communities and civil society.@@@We thank them once again.@@@It must be said that even if the Union of the Comoros is, thankfully, currently classified in the “green” category, we must remain vigilant, especially being an island country, in order to avoid a new outbreak of the disease.@@@Consequently, the Comorian Government is making considerable efforts to support the population on a daily basis, particularly in this time of global food crisis resulting from COVID-19 and aggravated by the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.@@@I welcome the action of all the development partners of the Comoros and reiterate my thanks to them here.@@@Alongside the United Nations system, the newly signed framework plan for sustainable development for the next five years perfectly integrates the priorities held by the Emerging Comoros Plan, the reference framework par excellence for the development of our country.@@@The combined efforts of the Government and bilateral and multilateral partners must converge towards a major objective, that of the emergence of our country by 2030.@@@In that light, in early December we intend to organize in the country a follow-up seminar to the Conference of Development Partners that was held in France in 2019 in order to mobilize the promises made to support this challenge of emergence by 2030.@@@I would like therefore to launch from this rostrum a friendly and fraternal appeal to all our partners to find together the ways and means of evolving towards the concretization of the commitments we made in Paris to finance the various projects targeted in the programme.@@@At the regional level, I attach particular importance to the close cooperation that exists between the Comoros and the countries with which we share a common destiny in the Indian Ocean area.@@@The Union of the Comoros also participates in regional efforts aimed at ensuring security in eastern Africa and, in that context, supports the sisterly Republic of Mozambique in its fight against terrorism, a scourge that spares no country.@@@Regional and international solidarity must therefore prevail if we are to wage a merciless fight against this scourge and ensure the safety of all.@@@Our presence every year here at the United Nations is irrefutable proof of the interest we place in multilateralism and of our conviction of the major role of the Organization in further humanizing the world.@@@This year, it reflects an even stronger and unshakable common resolve to act for the good of our respective peoples.@@@In conclusion, I would like to stress the need for continued unity and solidarity within the international community.@@@It is together and within an organized framework that we will find the appropriate solutions to the great challenges of our time, for greater peace and progress, and for the betterment of all of us and generations to come.@@@Twenty years ago, Switzerland spoke for the first time from this rostrum as a full Member of the United Nations (see A/57/PV.1).@@@Switzerland’s joining the United Nations in 2002 was a special event.@@@It was not solely a question of timing.@@@Indeed, at the time Switzerland had already long been the host State of the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva.@@@Switzerland was also active in various specialized agencies of the United Nations.@@@No, the specificity of this event was quite different.@@@Switzerland is the only country to have joined the Organization following a popular vote by its
people.@@@That decision reflected the alignment between the values and goals of the United Nations and those anchored in the Swiss Constitution.@@@That is why we feel so closely bound to the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The principles enshrined in the Charter are more important than ever.@@@Our world has rarely faced so many challenges as it does today.@@@We are living in a pivotal moment, for ourselves, for the United Nations Charter and for the entire planet.@@@I was shocked by the military aggression launched by Russia, a great Power, against its neighbour Ukraine.@@@Allow me to clarify that this military aggression violates the most basic principles of the Charter, which was adopted in the aftermath of the Second World War precisely with the aim of preventing wars.@@@Switzerland reiterates its call on Russia to put an end to the war in Ukraine without further delay and to respect the latter’s territorial integrity.@@@The consequences of this war affect the entire world, adding to the many other global crises that we must, of course, not forget.@@@Almost no continent today is spared by armed conflict.@@@Tensions are growing among great Powers, among neighbouring States and even within certain countries.@@@Every day, international humanitarian law and human rights are violated.@@@That is intolerable and should alarm us.@@@Serious human rights violations are indeed harbingers of possible escalations of violence and instability.@@@If we examine a map of ongoing conflicts today, it becomes clear that a direct link almost always exists with other issues that destabilize our world, including: growing food insecurity; high energy prices and the issue of energy security; climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution; even global health challenges, such as the coronavirus pandemic, which we have just experienced and not yet overcome, and whose heavy economic and social consequences we continue to feel.@@@Strengthened by its qualities and the experiences accumulated over the course of its history, Switzerland is determined to contribute its stone to the building in order to collectively find “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, to quote the theme of this seventy-seventh session.@@@My country, Switzerland, is distinguished not only by its system of direct democracy, its federalism, the stability that characterizes its politics and its economy, but also by its diversity and ability to derive innovative solutions therefrom.@@@Those characteristics shape the way we manage conflicts and solve complex problems in our country.@@@The Swiss culture of compromise and consensus is an appropriate one.@@@Problems are tackled and resolved through dialogue that is sometimes difficult and slow, but that is peaceful.@@@That certainly takes time, but it allows a broad consensus to be reached, leading to a final result more slowly than elsewhere.@@@We have been a Member of the United Nations since 2002.@@@We were not among the first.@@@It was not a speedy process; however, it provides stability and durability to our situation.@@@That is precisely what happened when Switzerland joined the United Nations.@@@I believe that our experience is also relevant to a world that, undoubtedly, is facing a new era due to the upheaval in Europe.@@@Allow me therefore, in all modesty, to outline four elements that are of great value to Switzerland and that also seem to me to be decisive in meeting the many global challenges.@@@The first is the importance of fundamental norms and values.@@@The second is the inseparability of independence and cooperation.@@@The third is the commitment to peace and security.@@@The fourth is the courage to stay the course.@@@Let us take things in order.@@@Starting with the importance of fundamental norms and values, public international law is essential.@@@It is all the more essential the smaller a country is.@@@We cannot allow the power of the strong to prevail over the rights of the weak.@@@That is why Switzerland is committed to respecting public international law, which includes international humanitarian law and human rights.@@@That is also why Switzerland is committed to the fight against impunity.@@@We must all ensure that serious breaches of international law are punished.@@@Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions, as for example in the case of the mass grave in the city of Izyum.@@@In that context, values provide direction for our action.@@@We consider solidarity with the international community and sustainable development to be vital.@@@In that regard, our common road map is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which must enable our societies to be more resilient, more sustainable and more inclusive in the future.@@@Some global circumstances have significantly slowed the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Switzerland is proud, however, to have presented its second national report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda this year.@@@That report reveals the progress made, even if additional efforts must be made to achieve all the Goals.@@@I therefore invite Member States to return to the fundamental values of the 2030 Agenda and to redouble their collective efforts towards its implementation.@@@The second point concerns the inseparable nature of independence and cooperation, which are not mutually contradictory.@@@Under the Charter of the United Nations, each country is sovereign and thus independent.@@@Like any country, Switzerland values its independence.@@@That allows us to give the diversity of our culture and our population the attention it deserves.@@@Switzerland has four national languages and great cultural diversity.@@@It is made up of 26 distinct cantons, all of which were politically active long before the federal State.@@@Given those characteristics, we have learned that cooperation, mutual respect and continuous dialogue are the only way to deal with difficulties.@@@Independence and cooperation are actually two closely related concepts.@@@Without cooperation, independence would mean isolation, and without independence, cooperation would be a constraint.@@@An open dialogue between equals, a climate of trust and collaboration are also of paramount importance for international cooperation.@@@Thanks to the international character of Geneva, Switzerland contributes to that dialogue.@@@Geneva is the centre of multilateral diplomacy for matters relating to global governance, peace, human rights, disarmament, the environment and health.@@@More recently, Geneva has become significant in terms of anticipating technological challenges.@@@For all of us, the United Nations is a unique and universal platform for dialogue and cooperation.@@@We must take full advantage of it.@@@My third point concerns the commitment to peace and security.@@@Switzerland is a neutral country.@@@That means that we strictly respect the right of neutrality anchored in public international law.@@@We do not involve ourselves in conflicts or provide military support to either side of a conflict.@@@Nothing can call that into question.@@@However, neutrality does not mean indifference or the absence of solidarity.@@@We are committed to safeguarding the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law — all values also anchored in the Swiss Constitution.@@@Switzerland was elected to the Security Council in this Hall on 9 June with 187 votes (see A/76/PV.79).@@@We thank Member States for the strong mandate they have entrusted to us and for the trust they have shown in us.@@@In submitting its application, Switzerland demonstrated that it, too, is ready to assume its responsibilities for safeguarding peace and security in the world.@@@We will work tirelessly to live up to the trust Member States have placed in us and to embody our slogan, “A Plus for Peace”.@@@With that in mind, we have four priorities.@@@The first is to promote lasting peace.@@@We want to make available our long-standing experience in the field of peace promotion and conflict prevention.@@@In that context, we place special emphasis on the participation of women in peace processes.@@@Our second priority is to protect the civilian population.@@@It is they who pay the heaviest price in conflicts.@@@We will commit to the protection of civilians and to respect for international humanitarian law and human rights.@@@Our third priority is to strengthen the effectiveness of the Security Council.@@@We have long been committed to the improved effectiveness of that fundamental organ of the United Nations, greater transparency in its work and the involvement of all actors concerned.@@@We will pursue that path within the framework of our mandate.@@@Our fourth priority is to act for climate security.@@@Climate change, one of the greatest challenges we face, also threatens peace and security.@@@Therefore, we will mobilize to ensure that this issue is also dealt with within the Security Council.@@@Of course, our commitment to a more peaceful world is not limited to the Security Council.@@@Switzerland hosted, alongside its Ukrainian partners, the conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine in the canton of Ticino, my birthplace.@@@The resulting Lugano principles set widely accepted criteria for reconstruction and reform in Ukraine.@@@I take this opportunity to acknowledge the involvement of our partners, the United Kingdom and Germany, in pursuing this process in 2023 and 2024, respectively.@@@If the parties concerned so wish, Switzerland is always ready to provide its long and extensive experience of good offices.@@@The fourth element of great value to Switzerland is the courage to stay the course.@@@We face complex challenges, yet we have limited resources.@@@It is therefore essential to prioritize our action.@@@What does that mean for multilateralism?@@@It means that we must focus on the essential question of the peaceful and lasting coexistence of peoples and States.@@@It means that we need a strong and effective United Nations, and it can be effective only if it is concentrated and focused.@@@It means that a clear division of labour and better connectedness
of United Nations agencies is needed.@@@It will then be possible to harness all the existing synergies.@@@It also means we need to further leverage science.@@@I greatly appreciated the fact that the President of Assembly mentioned that collaboration with science in his statement this morning.@@@We call it science diplomacy.@@@The momentum offered by this new branch of diplomacy paves the way for new approaches and advances that can lead to concrete solutions.@@@The Swiss Government, with the canton of Geneva, is proud to have created in that spirit the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA) Foundation.@@@GESDA aims to anticipate the challenges posed by new technologies so as to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks for human beings, and to guarantee a sustainable future on our planet.@@@Or, if I may put it another way, the targeted strengthening of multilateralism and the refocusing on core tasks are precisely the instrument that will allow us to jointly find a way out of these troubled times in which we live and to move towards a better future.@@@The United Nations offers a unique framework—the only current framework at the global level — to give concrete expression to the resolution enshrined in the preamble of its Charter, namely, to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security.@@@That is our focus — we are partners, not adversaries.@@@I have the privilege and signal honour, on behalf of Mr. Patrice Talon, President of the Republic of Benin, who is unable to be here today, to deliver this statement, as follows:
“At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to extend to@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi@@@my warm congratulations on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@“I would also like to extend my congratulations to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, and his team for their remarkable work, carried out with competence and dedication, during their mandate, which deserves to be commended.@@@“Finally, I pay a warm tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, with all my appreciation for the commendable efforts that he continues to deploy, alongside the Members, for the achievement of the noble objectives of our common Organization.@@@“The theme around which we gather this year, A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges’, is a pressing call to action.@@@Indeed, this session is being held in a difficult international context, marked by the combined consequences of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the war in Ukraine, with their economic, political and social impacts on the whole world.@@@“In terms of peace and security, the first pillar of United Nations action and at the global level, action on our part, in the opinion of my delegation and in accordance with the position clearly expressed by the African Union, calls for imperative respect for international law and the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine.@@@We therefore urge the parties to the conflict to establish an immediate ceasefire and to open political negotiations without delay in order to save the world from the consequences of a planetary conflict.@@@“At the regional level, in this case in the area of West Africa to which Benin belongs, peace and security are threatened by the combined effects of the terrorist threat, on the one hand, and of maritime piracy, on the other, which constitute major obstacles to the free movement of persons and goods, as well as to the development of the nations concerned.@@@Those obstacles, far from being purely regional issues, constitute a global threat and call for an immediate, coherent and integrated response from the community of nations.@@@“In terms of development, the second pillar of United Nations action, the time for diagnosis is long past, since we have already adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, whose articulations offer us a real plan of action for humankind and the planet in the immediate future and for posterity, in a more forward-looking approach.@@@“Aware of its own responsibilities, Africa, through the formulation and launch of a transformative vision for the continent, ‘The Africa We Want’, embodied by the African Union Agenda 2063, is resolutely committed to its economic integration and the acceleration of its industrialization, with added value and increased integration into global value chains.@@@This means that the issue of Africa’s development, as one of the eight major priorities of the United Nations, must continue to be the subject of fruitful reflection, as was the case in July at the High-level Dialogue on Africa, organized jointly by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.@@@“However, in this decade of action, it is urgent that concrete and bold actions accompany the reflections so that solutions can be found to the concerns of the African continent.@@@Benin, for its part, is resolutely committed to ensuring a common social minimum for all by tirelessly investing in the satisfaction of the vital needs of all its citizens, which are to dress decently, to eat properly, to be housed with dignity, to enjoy proper health care and to be educated in an appropriate way.@@@“To that end, and in addition to courageous reforms in terms of good governance and optimal mobilization of internal financial resources, the Government of Benin is investing in finding innovative sources for mobilizing the funds necessary for its development, through the successful issuance of special Sustainable Development Goals Euro bonds, for example.@@@It is urgent that robust and appropriate support be provided to our countries, in support of their efforts, in order to consolidate and sustain the gains made, on the one hand, and to effectively meet the pending challenges, on the other.@@@“Development, if it is to be sustainable, requires, in addition to its economic and social components, an environmental component without which it cannot exist.@@@That is why it is more than ever time to pursue our joint efforts to deal appropriately with the problem of climate change, which poses a real existential threat for Benin, due to the combined effects of desertification in the north, coastal erosion and the ongoing salinization of fresh water in the south, and the increasingly accentuated disruption of the cycle of the seasons throughout the national territory.@@@In that context, Benin has great hopes for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and calls on the entire community of nations to hold fruitful discussions and achieve results that are commensurate with the stakes before and the restoration of hope.@@@“With regard to the promotion and protection of human rights, Benin, at the international level and thanks to the start this year of its mandate as a member of the Human Rights Council, contributes and will continue to contribute to actively promote and facilitate all initiatives contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is the most concrete way to guarantee respect for the rights of the human person.@@@“At the national level, Benin, among other actions, is investing in the mobilization, through various strategies, of resources to give the most vulnerable populations access to an adequate food system, high-quality education, health care that protects everyone, including the poorest, drinking water, electricity and clean energy.@@@“Faced with the multiple challenges that challenge us, the time is more than ever ripe for the need to preserve and even strengthen multilateralism and make it truly inclusive and based on rules that are fair and valid for all, as a crucible for reflection and action to provide viable and comprehensive solutions.@@@In this context, Benin fully supports ongoing diplomatic initiatives within the United Nations to find peaceful, lasting and equitable solutions to the question of the creation of a viable Palestinian State endowed with the attributes of full international sovereignty and living in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel; to efforts to find a definitive solution to the question of Western Sahara, capitalizing on the achievements of the political process, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, which is aimed at reaching a compromise solution, in the framework of the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; and to the question of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba, concerning which Benin associates itself with the declarations of the relevant summits of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, on the one hand, and with the resolution adopted at the thirty-fifth ordinary session of the African Union, held in February in Addis Ababa, on the other, to appeal to the need to end the said blockade in the name of the promotion of peace and development.@@@Better still, we call for the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States of America, which are two partners dear to Benin.@@@“As the Secretary-General underlines in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), the history of humankind, ancient and recent, demonstrates that it is capable of great things when it acts united and that we are now more than ever called upon to make a fateful choice between remaining passive and promoting the continuation of the ongoing disintegration, or acting resolutely to build a better, greener and safer future.@@@I remain convinced that we will hear the voice of reason in favour of action for a better world.@@@“The theme of this session is fully relevant at a time rightly described as “decisive”, it invites us to find transformative solutions, in the face of interlocking challenges.@@@That will be possible only through the engagement of multidimensional partnerships involving Governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society, with the common goal, in a spirit of shared responsibility, of taking bold action for the diligent implementation of existing agreements, in particular the effective achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@“It is therefore with this call to responsible action, and with faith in our ability to work together to meet the challenges before us, that I wish full success to the work of the seventy-seventh session of General Assembly, pledging the readiness of my delegation to spare no effort to follow up, jointly with other members, on the commitments made in the context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@“Long live more solid, more inclusive and more coherent multilateral cooperation in the service of sustainable development!”@@@I congratulate Mr. Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also pause to salute his predecessor in office, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, Foreign Minister of Maldives, for his sterling tenure during his service.@@@I recognize the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his outstanding stewardship over the past few years.@@@It is indeed an honour for me to address this organ for the first time since assuming the role of Prime Minister just 44 days ago.@@@I bring greetings from the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and we pledge our unswerving support for the ethos of this great organ.@@@I assumed my new responsibilities at a time when the complexities of the multiple and interlocking challenges facing humankind require from us a renewed commitment to the democratic principle and to multilateralism.@@@It is clear to me that the tectonic plates of geopolitics and global stability are shifting beneath us.@@@What are those tectonic shifts?@@@It is now certain knowledge that a pathogen can emerge with such lethal power that it threatens the very survival of humankind.@@@The coincidence in timing of a global pandemic and a war, with the growing calamity of the climate crisis, has exposed the fragility, vulnerability and instability of the global supply chains for food, staples and other essentials.@@@Power shifts are taking place in international relations as the influence of some countries rises and that of others wanes.@@@With that has come an insistence on the reform of the United Nations to make it more relevant and reflective of the composition of today’s world and the current power structures, including the reform of the anachronistic Security Council.@@@The effect and widespread nature of technology is creating change faster than most can manage.@@@Faith in multilateral systems is being eroded, and their capacity to do global good is being jeopardized by the rise in crass, unbridled nationalism, which has shown the powerful to be nonchalant to the suffering of anyone other than their own population.@@@It was the seventh Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who reminded us that no nation can defend itself against the threats to development entirely on its own and that the challenges we face are global, and they demand a global response.@@@That remains true today.@@@The coronavirus disease, with all its consequences, has presented us with a powerful reminder that we are all connected, which compels every nation and every person to be their brothers’ and sisters’ keepers.@@@The United Nations finds itself at a crossroads in our reckoning with history’s judgment.@@@Do we want to be the body that abdicated our responsibility to protect the planet or the body that debates and postures as the world around us submerges beneath cascading crises?@@@It is my hope that we choose instead to be the body that met the moment and responded to the fierce urgency of now.@@@We must therefore use this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly not merely for political posturing, but for a resolute recommitment to multilateral cooperation.@@@For small island developing States, and indeed vulnerable peoples everywhere, there can be no international security without climate security.@@@That requires collective fidelity to multilateral action for our very survival.@@@I am ready, and I am sure that all of us are eager to build a better world through multilateral action and to uphold this sacred tenet of the United Nations with all our will and might.@@@Even as geopolitics and great Power competition exacerbate conflict and the climate catastrophe, we must face the hard truth that only through multilateralism will we force the global trajectory towards global peace, prosperity and sustainability.@@@Every country on the planet and national populations have had to confront the reality of climate change.@@@As our planet heats up, so too have the frustrations and impatience of the globe’s ordinary citizens, who feel that they are losing the fight to make ends meet and secure the future of their children.@@@Small island developing States and other developing nations experience a reality that is plagued by that continuous existential threat.@@@With the passage of every hurricane, every outbreak of war and every global food shortage, we all remain at risk of tipping the balance that we have striven to create over these many years.@@@Consequently, it is not enough for us to articulate that grim reality year after year.@@@We must now look to act in ways that provide tailored responses to those vulnerabilities so as to foster true resilience and risk mitigation.@@@I therefore humbly urge countries to honour the financial commitments made before the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to double contributions to adaptation financing by 2025.@@@A delayed response to those commitments would further imperil our developing nations.@@@Climate financing, resiliency and environmental conservation must be integrated into national development policies and must be at the forefront of our global development agenda.@@@The situation cries out for the multilateral system to urgently put in place a multidimensional vulnerability index that takes into consideration the particular characteristics and climate vulnerabilities of small island developing States such as mine.@@@All countries are environmentally vulnerable; all are socially and economically exposed to the exogenous shock, but the climate-challenged, tourism-dependent countries in the Caribbean Sea run the real risk of a wipe-out event during several consecutive months every year.@@@Surely that warrants special consideration.@@@Caribbean nations are on the bullet end of a climate fight that we did not cause, do not want and cannot afford, but that we are unable to escape.@@@I therefore join my brother and sister leaders in the Caribbean Community in calling for the development of a multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@Saint Kitts and Nevis will use such an index in its advocacy for a more
appropriate redistribution of development assistance and access to concessional financing.@@@Notwithstanding such injustice, we continue to invest in social empowerment programmes in order to build resilience in our people and our economy.@@@One such area is education, which is one of society’s greatest equalizers.@@@Saint Kitts and Nevis reaffirms that access to quality education is a human right and the foundation of sustainable development and thriving societies.@@@We welcome the Transforming Education Summit, which was held earlier this week.@@@I am happy to report that our Government committed to entering a new pact — a new deal on education, as it were — that will reform, transform and reinvigorate our education system based on equality, access and inclusion.@@@In fact, just a few weeks ago, my Government made a decision to introduce free tertiary education to ensure that all people can have equal access regardless of their socioeconomic status.@@@Other goals for education reforms include, but are not limited to, first, incorporating specialist spaces for science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics in all schools; secondly, reintroducing the I-Literacy one-to-one laptop programme; and thirdly, strengthening technical and vocational education by providing alternative programming and scholarships.@@@As part of my Government’s thrust to mainstream empowerment across all sectors and policies, Saint Kitts and Nevis will continue to put women and young people at the forefront of its social development and all its pursuits, including the advancement of the digital economy.@@@We are confident that our active inclusion of women and young people in public life through their appointment in our Parliament, diplomatic and senior civil service and other decision-making forums will bear much fruit.@@@It is against that backdrop that we therefore pledge our support for the ongoing process of the Declaration for Future Generations, which will culminate in the Summit of the Future next year.@@@As its leader, I pledge my country’s active commitment to meeting Sustainable Development Goal 5 and surpassing, or meeting, the goals of the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women in achieving gender equity now and for future generations.@@@The recent past has proved that we cannot ignore the glaring truth of our interconnectedness as nations in the international community.@@@The world continues to shrink in size, drawing us all nearer to each other as a people, reinforcing the need for global solidarity, international cooperation and strong and meaningful partnerships.@@@We are therefore stronger in the company of our friends, particularly those that share our democratic principles and values.@@@At this body of nations, I re-emphasize our unswerving support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United Nations system.@@@Taiwan has been a long-standing friend and a partner for sustainable development.@@@Its unfailing commitment in that regard since the very day of my country’s independence is consistent with the spirit and intent of Sustainable Development Goal 17.@@@I can also speak first-hand to what our friendship with the Republic of Cuba means to me and its value to the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.@@@Cuba has partnered with my own country and many in the developing world in health care, education, training and agriculture.@@@We therefore call for an end to the decades-long embargo imposed against Cuba.@@@My country encourages meaningful dialogue in resolving that and other conflicts in countries targeted by unfair sanctions that create enduring external and internal hardships.@@@In conclusion, we must be bold and grand in the way in which we forge ahead with the promise to leave no one behind.@@@My Government and I are prepared to do our utmost for our people.@@@That will be enhanced by multilateralism, and the United Nations should afford that opportunity to all of us.@@@The theme for this year’s General Assembly shares the idea of a watershed, which speaks to the significant and transformational changes that are taking place.@@@The challenges faced by the countries of the world and their peoples are indeed interlocking, and we must resolve them together.@@@The issue for us is how we will bring that change about for those who most need it.@@@Rarely have the foundations of this institution been shaken as strongly as in the early hours of 24 February, when various cities throughout Ukraine felt the terror of Russian bombardments.@@@More than six months later, we still witness the horror of an invasion that evokes times we believed we had left behind in Europe.@@@Yesterday Putin continued his headlong rush with totally unacceptable statements.@@@From this rostrum and what it represents, I want to condemn in the strongest terms the announcement of the annexation referendums in the occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson.@@@Those false referendums constitute a further violation of international law by Vladimir Putin.@@@Let me be clear: the results will never be recognized.@@@We will continue to support what we have supported since the beginning of this dispute — the freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.@@@It is precisely now when we must act united in defence of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in support of an attacked country, Ukraine.@@@This war seeks to rob the sovereign people of Ukraine of their legitimate right to exist in peace and freedom, and it has condemned the entire world — because it is a global crisis — to an era of uncertainty.@@@And it has done so at the very moment when we were on the cusp of a well-deserved era of optimism, just after humankind had successfully set in motion the greatest large-scale scientific and humanitarian cooperation effort in its history in order to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).@@@In these uncertain times, the economic and social consequences of the war are a threat to global prosperity, especially for the most vulnerable countries.@@@The food crisis, which has been central to the debate of the General Assembly, is being compounded by an energy crisis provoked by an autocrat who will stop at nothing and utilize any and every instrument as a weapon of war in order to stay in power.@@@The impact on prices, already rising due to the supply chain crisis last year, threatens to leave the world’s poorest even poorer.@@@It is not hard to understand why many people feel that they have had enough.@@@Young people, born at the start of this new millennium, in particular represent a generation that, in addition to confronting this new crisis in their lives, is living under the very real threat of the climate emergency and its consequences for the world they will inherit.@@@Despite everything, however, I am certain that precisely where the danger lies, there too lies our salvation.@@@That is why today I want to extend an unequivocal message of hope and confidence — hope in the capacity of the international community to overcome any adversity, and confidence in the strength of an institution such as the United Nations to rise up against challenges that know no borders.@@@Allow me to focus this reflection on five major challenges: the commitment to global health, the food crisis, the environmental transition, the digital transition and true and effective gender equality.@@@In matters of global health, it is essential that we learn from the lessons of our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@On 9 November 2020, the whole world celebrated the news that the first vaccine against the virus was proving successful.@@@Barely six weeks later, the first doses began to be administered.@@@With those vaccines, not only did we begin to invert the trend of the pandemic, but we also reversed the pessimism of a world that had come to doubt whether things would ever return to normal.@@@The vaccine represents many things, but above all — in my view — it represents the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.@@@I say that because, in just two years, the world has managed to develop not one or two, but 40 vaccines against COVID-19.@@@Through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, more than 2 billion doses have been allocated for developing countries.@@@Massive vaccination campaigns have enabled us to control the spread of the virus and return to normality in many countries.@@@However, it is clear that much remains to be done and that many lessons must be drawn from the handling of the pandemic.@@@The degree of inequality between countries with regard to access to the vaccine is, quite simply, insulting.@@@That inequality, moreover, is to the detriment of humankind as a whole because a virus cannot be eradicated if its spread is not halted in each and every country around the globe.@@@Spain, which was very affected at the beginning of the pandemic due to our strong tourism sector, seeks to be part of the global solution to the enormous challenge that this pandemic and future pandemics represent.@@@We will contribute €15 million to the Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and we support the adoption of a legally binding international instrument to that end by the World Health Organization.@@@In that way, we will strengthen a key organization in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Our debt to science also demands that we take action in areas neglected during our race against the virus.@@@We must step up efforts and promote scientific research in order to guarantee universal access to medical care and treatment.@@@Over the next three years, Spain intends to allocate more than €237 million of its official development assistance funds to health-related issues, including €130 million for the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.@@@The second major challenge I wish to share is the food crisis currently threatening millions of human beings.@@@It is a complex problem that has the potential to deteriorate in 2023 if we do not act.@@@The crisis has been exacerbated both by Russia’s blockade of grain exports from Ukraine and by selfish decisions to erect barriers to trade in agricultural products and fertilizers.@@@Two days ago, as co-sponsor of the Leaders Network Reinforcing Multilateralism Together, I co-chaired — together with the President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, the President of the European Council and the United States Secretary of State — the Global Food Security Summit, on the current food crisis affecting the entire planet.@@@It brought numerous world leaders from all regions, especially those most affected by this crisis, and we adopted a joint declaration renewing our commitment to deal with the crisis.@@@The meeting had a very clear purpose — to address this challenge and to seek solutions as a matter of urgency.@@@At the meeting, I announced that Spain would lead by example by mobilizing €151 million in donations, and a further €85 million in loans over the next three years.@@@That step is consistent with my country’s commitment to combating inequality and poverty the world over.@@@That commitment has been made visible through our new law on cooperation, which anchors our promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of our gross national income to official development assistance by 2030.@@@The third major challenge I wish to discuss is related to the climate emergency and the need to advance the ecological transition with urgency and determination.@@@It is clear that the current energy crisis is pushing us towards making a decisive commitment to far more sustainable energy models, reducing our dependencies and becoming more resilient.@@@Diversifying, electrifying and decarbonizing our energy mix will be essential for
two reasons.@@@First, we must prevent certain countries from using their resources as a weapon of war, as Putin’s regime is doing.@@@Russia believes it has the right to blackmail the entire planet, helping to increase inflation and jeopardize the crucial recovery of the many economies that have suffered greatly due to the pandemic.@@@Secondly, it is necessary because if we are to respond to climate change, which is the fundamental and increasingly obvious challenge facing our and future generations, we need to redouble our commitment to the transition to renewable energy.@@@I believe that the current situation is pushing us to even greater determination to deliver on our societies’ commitment to decarbonizing our economies.@@@It is not a question of whether or not to do so but to do it fairly and at the speed demanded by the scientific certainty that time is running out.@@@In that regard, Spain also wants to contribute to concrete solutions within the framework of the United Nations.@@@Together with Senegal, we will support the creation of an international alliance for drought resilience to promote innovation, technology transfer and the mobilization of resources for countries exposed to this threat, which includes Spain.@@@We will present that initiative in Egypt in November during the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, together with the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and other interested countries.@@@I believe that the energy crisis is severely testing all European societies, including mine, essentially because of the harshness with which it is attacking the social majority of our societies, the middle and working classes.@@@Every measure taken to reduce its impact should be based on the principle that this time the burdens and sacrifices should not fall on the shoulders of the great majority who were mistreated in previous crises, in particular the financial crisis.@@@In that context, Spain has pushed for far-reaching regulatory reforms to reduce the impact of gas prices.@@@But we are also aware, as the Secretary-General has said, that we must continue working — as we have been doing so for more than a year now — on vitally urgent reform of the electricity sector throughout the European Union.@@@It is time to move forward by adjusting the sector to the current reality and distributing and limiting the costs and benefits of price increases in a fairer way.@@@That is a commitment that my country will adhere to and uphold.@@@The fourth major challenge I want to mention relates to the digital transition and its impact on education and labour rights, now and in the future.@@@On Monday, Spain participated in a session of the Transforming Education Summit dedicated to the digital transformation.@@@We once again evoked the lessons learned during the pandemic and how technological solutions made it possible for the benefit of our children to bridge the gap of the in-person presence that was impossible at the time.@@@Spain wants to play a leading role in that regard.@@@We will be hosting the Giga Technology Centre, a United Nations programme for the digitalization of education to be established in the beautiful city of Barcelona, thanks to Spain’s collaboration with UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union.@@@Education is the path to a more educated, better informed, freer, more inclusive and more egalitarian society.@@@If we want to continue advancing our human rights agenda, it is essential that we continue to support the right to education for all, but especially for girls.@@@For it is at school where the agenda for gender equality and the empowerment of women — half of the world’s population — begins.@@@In that connection, my fifth and final point concerns the feminist agenda and real and effective equality between men and women.@@@We live in times when stating the obvious sounds revolutionary.@@@The global threats to women’s sexual and reproductive freedom are yet another example of the exasperatingly slow progress the world is making in ensuring full equality between men and women.@@@Worse still, we are seeing that previous achievements are fragile, with women falling victim to an inexplicable regression in some advanced democracies in the twenty-first century.@@@Spain will continue to be at the forefront on the matter, with the adoption of a new law guaranteeing sexual freedom and a future law on sexual and reproductive health to ensure public health care for women and all their needs across the entire country.@@@In that area, I would also like to announce that Spain will lead by example and contribute €100 million over the next three years to organizations working for gender equality and with a focus on reproductive and sexual rights, including UN- Women.@@@I believe it essential that we listen to women’s voices and remove every obstacle in their path so that they can occupy their rightful spaces in business, Government and peacebuilding.@@@I invite members to participate in a simple exercise and contrast pictures from 20, 30 or 40 years ago.@@@Compare family photographs at home with the images that appeared then in the national media.@@@For example, in my country, Spain, it is surprising and indeed amusing to see how our fashion, appearances and habits
have changed — including smoking indoors.@@@All of that has changed.@@@However, when we compare those images, we see one particularly intolerable difference, which is the presence of women in family photographs and their absence in public images reflecting the political or economic news of the day.@@@We have come a long way towards achieving equality between women and men, but there is still a long way to go.@@@Besides, not everything can be guaranteed, as we saw a few months ago in Afghanistan with the Taliban’s rise to power.@@@Last month, I had the privilege of visiting the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center in the Colombian capital of Bogota.@@@I was able to observe first-hand the efforts of an entire people, and especially its women, to move forward by providing reparations to victims and building a society free of violence.@@@Colombia is entering a new stage of hope in its efforts to continue building peace, and Spain will stand by its side, ready to support it.@@@The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have a fundamental role to play in the world and in the multilateral order, starting with the defence of democracy.@@@However, we must be aware that the region also needs international support, including in the fight against drug trafficking.@@@Spain is committed to supporting Latin America and the Caribbean and we will work to achieve greater rapprochement between the region and the European Union under our presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of next year.@@@We want Europe to reaffirm its broad and strategic outlook towards Latin America and the Caribbean, aimed at achieving very simple objectives that make sense, such as revitalizing a fundamental alliance between the two regions.@@@We must also pay greater attention to our own southern neighbourhood.@@@We are ready to take up the baton at a key moment for Europe.@@@We seize it with enthusiasm and hope, aware of the challenges ahead and the responsibility it represents.@@@We want the priorities I have just outlined to permeate and direct our action in the second half of 2023.@@@The green transition and digitalization, as well as the social transition, will resolutely guide the path we wish to follow during our presidency of the Council of the European Union.@@@Europe is a project for stability, peace, freedom, democracy and harmony.@@@It is a project for peace that we want to see projected into other parts of the world, starting with Ukraine.@@@It is clear that we must continue to work to ensure that other areas, in addition to Ukraine, also regain stability.@@@We are making progress in negotiations to reach a nuclear deal in Iran, in which I believe the European Union is playing a key role.@@@However, we have recently seen how tensions in the East China Sea are threatening the status quo in a region that is key to humankind’s present and future.@@@The importance of Asia in the field of global security was underlined at the NATO Summit in Madrid in June, which brought NATO’s Pacific partners together at the top level for the first time and endorsed a new strategic concept for the organization for the next 10 years.@@@In Madrid, we welcomed two new full and democratic members, Sweden and Finland, and approved a new strategic concept for NATO that will guide the future of the alliance for the next few years.@@@The concept makes a fine-tuned diagnosis of an increasingly complex strategic environment.@@@It gives significant attention to the South and the Sahel in particular, a region affected by growing instability and increasing terrorism.@@@We must focus on the serious risks in the area such as irregular migration flows and the threat of terrorism, which could be exacerbated by the conjunction of the food and energy crisis, the climate emergency and demographic trends.@@@We cannot carry over conflicts from the past century.@@@For that reason, with regard to Western Sahara, an area of great importance to Spain, we support a mutually acceptable political solution within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@In that regard, we consider the work of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara to be fundamental, and I want to assure him of the Spanish Government’s full support.@@@My country will continue to support the Sahrawi population in refugee camps, as it has always done, in its capacity as the main international donor of humanitarian aid to those camps.@@@On the other hand, as I reported during last year’s general debate (see A/76/PV.9), on 31 December 2020, Spain and the United Kingdom reached a bilateral understanding on Gibraltar in the context of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.@@@We have been working very hard since then to ensure that this understanding serves to lay the foundations for the territory’s future relationship with the European Union, trusting that an agreement will be reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom in relation to Gibraltar as soon as possible.@@@The agreement should fully respect United Nations doctrine on the territory, with which Spain is wholly aligned, as well as for my country’s legal position with regard to its sovereignty and jurisdiction.@@@In any case, we hope to work for the
development of a prosperous social and economic area that encompasses the whole of Gibraltar and the Campo de Gibraltar as well.@@@In conclusion, I appealed at the beginning of my address to two sentiments — hope for the future and confidence in the multilateral order represented by the United Nations system.@@@Two years ago, we feared we would never again see a world in which people could shake hands or hug or kiss one another.@@@We came to believe that such acts of affection and courtesy would also fall victim to the pandemic.@@@Today the world that seemed unattainable has been restored.@@@It is a logic often repeated in history when societies arrive at a great crossroads.@@@Yet hope always finds away.@@@Sometimes with a push from science and knowledge, as in this case, and sometimes from a desire not to repeat the fatal mistakes of the past.@@@I believe that humankind will always find a way to overcome the blows of fate and move forward.@@@What makes the difference is how we deal with these crises and how we heal the wounds suffered along the way, while at the same time protecting those who are most vulnerable and most exposed.@@@We must be guided by the values and principles to which we all adhere as Member States of this noble and important Organization, in which Spain reaffirms its full confidence.@@@We must persevere in our efforts to build a freer, more prosperous, fair, diverse and democratic world.@@@In order to do so, it is essential to strengthen rules-based multilateralism and ultimately to guarantee peace — the most valuable asset we have.@@@Many times in history, assassinations have been the prologue to great tragedies.@@@Based on the rejection or hatred of their victims, the perpetrators of such actions have upended the public order and opened the gates to enormous social discord.@@@Entire peoples have succumbed to such prophets of hate.@@@For that very reason and in order to underscore the values of rational democratic coexistence, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the solidarity that the entire world has shown with Argentina with regard to the attempt on the life of our Vice-President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.@@@In Argentina, the attempt on the life of Vice-President not only affected the public order; it also sought to undermine the virtuous collective achievement that next year will see the celebration of its fortieth anniversary.@@@In 1983, we restored democracy and began a long historic cycle during which different political parties have alternated serving in the Government.@@@We Argentinians adopted the “never again” agreement on State terrorism and political violence.@@@We value democracy as a model of social development that demands respect for others in their diversity.@@@I am sure that fascist violence under the guise as republicanism will not succeed in changing the broad consensus to which the vast majority of Argentine society adheres.@@@By exploiting the unrest caused by the pandemic and the economic effects of the war, extremist and violent narratives have proliferated and found fertile ground for promoting anti-political sentiment in our societies.@@@Remaining silent before such glaring signs could make us responsible for jeopardizing the rule of law itself.@@@Those who seek to weaken and erode democracies have a special interest in fostering extreme polarization.@@@Let us not resign ourselves to such a scenario.@@@Let us forge a robust global condemnation of those who promote division in our communities.@@@It is incumbent upon the General Assembly to respond to the warning signs on the planet in a timely manner.@@@As survivors of a pandemic that struck humankind, we face the choice of learning from that tragic experience or watching the world move towards ever-greater confrontations.@@@The pandemic revealed the enormous inequalities endured by the world’s population.@@@Is it fair that the wealth of 10 men alone represents a sum greater than the combined income of 40 per cent of the world’s population?@@@Where are the ethics in the fact that the pandemic has claimed four times as many lives in the poorest countries than in the richest?@@@Failing to condemn this model of capital accumulation that concentrates wealth among a few people while millions of others drown in poverty makes us complicit in creating such a level of inequality.@@@We still have time to stop many of the threats facing humankind.@@@The injustices we are seeing will only get worse if extreme positions take root; if wars become protracted, while exacerbating hunger; and if persistent inflation erodes the incomes of the most vulnerable.@@@We must work together in solidarity.@@@We must strengthen a cooperative multilateralism that will ensure the strengthening of the rule of law, the principle of non-violence and greater equity to reduce social gaps.@@@In order to overcome such challenges, we must restore the primacy of peace.@@@We have always advocated for the peaceful settlement of all disputes.@@@It is imperative that all ongoing hostilities cease.@@@For that reason, we need to work together to pursue dialogue and restore peace in the dispute that began with the Russian Federation’s military encroachment on the territory of Ukraine.@@@As we seek to reach the horizon of global peacemaking, we must abandon the economic and financial practices that the developed world demands of the developing world.@@@Maintaining the current situation will only increase poverty and marginalization.@@@If we do not change, we will be unable to build fairer, freer and more stable societies committed to upholding their institutions.@@@Indebted nations suffer much more from the effects of the established system.@@@Argentina is among them.@@@For that reason, I would like to thank all the States that have supported us in the complex process of renegotiating our foreign debt.@@@My Government did not create that debt but is addressing it in all seriousness.@@@Our criteria are known.@@@They respond to the provisions of resolution 69/319 of 2015, which stipulates that sovereign debt restructurings must promote sustained and inclusive growth while minimizing economic and social costs, warranting the stability of the international financial system and respecting human rights.@@@While we call for a change in the paradigms that govern the international financial system, we subscribe to the same principles underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Food security must be guaranteed to all who live on the planet.@@@Hunger cannot be allowed in this day and age.@@@The recent reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations warn of the impact of the excessive volatility in some food prices and the changes in input markets that influence their production.@@@All of that has had and continues to have a significant effect on increased inflation worldwide; all of those factors are to the detriment of the most vulnerable.@@@Argentina will fulfil its role as a reliable producer and exporter of nutritious and quality food, as well as a supplier of technologies to improve food production.@@@We must guarantee a fairer and more transparent, equitable and predictable international trade system for agricultural products.@@@If we ensure such a system, food-producing countries will be able to make the needed investments to increase production and help alleviate world hunger
Just as we must ensure food security, we must have secure and predictable access to energy.@@@Argentina will continue to stand ready to help overcome that great challenge.@@@We are ramping up production to provide the world with clean energies ,and others that, like natural gas, will enable us to reduce carbon emissions during the transition.@@@We have the world’s
second largest unconventional gas reserves and the fourth largest unconventional oil reserves.@@@We hold large reserves of lithium and the potential to develop solar and wind energy, as well as low- and zero-emission hydrogen.@@@We are working to ensure that our path towards achieving environmental sustainability and food and energy security will be feasible, but all our efforts will be in vain if we do not walk on that path within a framework of increased equitable economic and social development.@@@In that spirit, we are deploying our industrial capabilities and creating added value along the entire production chain.@@@We must include our industrial, scientific and technological suppliers at every turn.@@@Production that creates dignified employment is the path we have chosen to develop.@@@Just as it is incumbent upon us to seek development that benefits everyone, the environmental situation of our planet urgently requires us to take firm and decisive action for the sake of future generations.@@@Ecological problems require the involvement of everyone.@@@They need a constructive relationship between States and societies — a crucial partnership, without which sustainable development becomes an illusion.@@@Urgent issues, such as climate change, biodiversity and plastic pollution, should mobilize our efforts in the hope that we can build a broad consensus to ensure the preservation of the planet and humankind.@@@We are not all equally responsible for the climate crisis.@@@Neither Latin America and the Caribbean nor Africa are at the forefront of carbon emissions.@@@Responsibilities must clearly be differentiated, and that requires immediately alleviating the efforts of those that were not to blame.@@@We want to continue strengthening Argentina’s long-standing position based on the principles of international humanitarian law, unrestricted respect for the sovereignty of States, the self-determination of peoples, the gender perspective and cooperation.@@@Through the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, holding the presidency pro tempore, we are reinforcing the principles of collaboration, promoting democratic pluralism and fostering South-@@@South and triangular cooperation.@@@Argentina is actively involved in peacekeeping operations, an essential instrument of the United Nations.@@@We will continue on that path.@@@I would like to draw attention to the use of unilateral coercive measures.@@@Under the Charter of the United Nations, the only legitimate sanctions are those imposed by the Security Council to enforce its resolutions regarding the maintenance of peace and security.@@@Argentina therefore joins the demand by the peoples of Cuba and Venezuela that the blockades suffered by those nations be lifted.@@@I would like to thank all Member States for having entrusted Argentina with the presidency of the Human Rights Council this year.@@@For us, the defence of human rights is part of our identity and our history.@@@The Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo taught us to persist and to fight.@@@They showed us the way so that, with political will and social consensus, we could carry out a process to eradicate impunity that is unique in the world, based on memory, truth and justice.@@@In the same spirit, our country has expanded citizens’ rights by developing laws and public policies that promote the equality of women and diversity, based on an intersectoral, intercultural and human- rights approach.@@@The much-declared social equality requires that we all have access to the advantages offered by the present.@@@In the digital era in which we live, we believe it a priority to universalize access to information and communication technologies and to promote actions that reduce the inequality gaps seen today.@@@The United Nations is the right place for the international community to achieve the necessary agreements to ensure the maintenance of a free, open, stable, secure and, above all, peaceful cyberspace, where hatred and violence are not fostered through anonymity.@@@Argentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.@@@It must be countered in the context of the rule of law and full respect for international law.@@@We continue to fight against impunity, investigating the attacks on the Israeli Embassy in 1992 and on the headquarters of the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) in 1994, which claimed the lives of 107 people and injured hundreds.@@@We want those responsible for such heinous attacks to be identified, tried and ultimately sentenced.@@@Once again, we urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities to advance the investigation into the AMIA bombing.@@@We also urge the international community to join us in our struggle by refraining from receiving or harbouring any of the accused, even if they enjoy diplomatic immunity.@@@We must remember that international arrest warrants and INTERPOL red notices are pending against them.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean is a region of peace.@@@We are working to also make it more just and equal.@@@We know the tremendous comparative advantage that the Southern Common Market, in particular, and all of Latin America, in general, have in sustainable food production and energy supply.@@@We have a great opportunity to develop.@@@If we improve the quality of life of our people by creating genuine employment, we can eradicate the pockets of poverty that persist in our societies today.@@@I wish to reaffirm the legitimate and inalienable sovereign rights of the Argentine Republic over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.@@@They are part of Argentina’s national territory and have been illegally occupied by the United Kingdom for almost 190 years.@@@The request made through resolution 2065 (XX), of 1965, has remained in force and has been reiterated on many occasions,
The United Kingdom persists in its attitude of disregarding the call to resume negotiations on the territorial dispute.@@@Moreover, it has exacerbated the dispute by its calls for the illegal exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural resources in the area.@@@It also insists on an unjustified and excessive military presence on the islands, which only brings tension to a region characterized as an area of peace and international cooperation.@@@We request that the Secretary-General renew his efforts to fulfil that request and that the United Kingdom agree to heed the call of the international community and put an end to that anachronistic colonial situation.@@@In that context, I wish to reiterate my country’s full readiness to return to the negotiating table and seek a solution that will put an end to this long-standing sovereignty dispute.@@@We live in a world where injustices and inequalities are increasing.@@@At the same time, democracies are increasingly at risk, peace is crumbling and uncertainty is increasing.@@@We have an urgent moral duty that cannot be postponed, and that is now.@@@We must work and implement effective global agreements that eradicate hunger, drastically reduce inequalities and ensure democratic stability, peace and coexistence.@@@Humankind is threatened.@@@Argentina humbly calls on all the countries of the world to build a new social model that ensures prosperity through social justice.@@@With only a few months left of my 10-year tenure in office, I stand before members to address the plenary session of the General Assembly for the very last time.@@@I would have wished nothing more than for this address to have been a reflection of positive developments in what humankind has had to face or is facing.@@@Like all of those here, I would have liked to have applauded the results of the implementation either of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations or of the decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.@@@That would have ensured that any threat or attempt to call into question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any United Nations State Member would have been brought to a complete halt or minimized; that long-standing conflicts and disputes would have been resolved or would be in the process of being resolved in accordance with the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations; that the need for the Organization’s reform would have led to the effective prevention of new threats and challenges to world peace; that, through its new role, the United Nations would have implemented projects to effectively combat hunger and to improve the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people in dire need of aid; and that the number of refugees and migrants forced to flee from their homes due to conflict or poverty would have been greatly reduced.@@@Furthermore, that would have ensured that we would have been able to tackle social and economic exclusion, the lack of adequate health-care standards and the shortage of educational opportunities; that
sustainable development would have finally become a reality for all countries and regions in need by establishing the necessary political and socioeconomic conditions that lead to stability, economic growth and institution-building; that measures for the prevention of climate change and its devastating consequences would have been implemented consistently by all parties involved; that terrorism and religious fundamentalism would have given way to tolerance and understanding; that the trillions of dollars spent on destructive weapons would instead have been spent on actions and programmes aiming to bridge the gap between rich and poor States; and, finally, that multilateralism would have been the guiding doctrine of all States.@@@In addressing the General Assembly in 2018 and referring to the weakness of dealing with the same problems, I wondered aloud:
“how is it that we come back again and again, year after year, as a kind of ritual, to attest to the dismal lack of effectiveness for some and the attempts at embellishment of others for what is in fact our inability to fulfil the aims of the Charter of the United Nations?”@@@(A/73/PV.10, p. 5)
I wondered further:
“Why do the decisions of the Security Council in their overwhelming majority remain mere certificates that attest to violations?@@@Why are international law and international agreements not implemented?@@@Why do strategies and programmes aimed at creating better conditions for people who are suffering remain wishful thinking?”@@@Although I am well aware that what I am about to say is well known to everyone in attendance, for the sake of history I cannot but relay some truths that are leading us on a declining path and to the gradual loss of credibility of the United Nations, an Organization that was formed right after the Second World War in order to prevent new disasters and to provide protection and hope to those in need of effective protection, as well as to take action to tackle the challenges I just mentioned.@@@I know that what I am saying may be outside the bounds of diplomatic etiquette, but I believe that the obligation of each leader before history is not to overlook failings and shortcomings in favour of wishful thinking or flattery.@@@That is why I will proceed with a review, not just of the reasons that have transformed the Organization into a repository of problems, but also of what States are required to do in order to lend credibility to the Organization so that it can effectively impose international legal order and consistently implement decisions and programmes for the benefit of humankind.@@@In my opinion, the weaknesses and inefficacies of the United Nations are due to several factors.@@@The first problem is the fact that international law is dictated by the financial or other interests of powerful Member States.@@@Secondly, despite the end of the Cold War, alliances based on common interests lead to tolerance towards States that violate international law if the offender is under their sphere of influence.@@@Thirdly, there is a resurgence of hegemonic tendencies by some States, with the aim of creating new empires, at the expense of smaller States and in violation of international law.@@@Fourthly, despite the declared intention of the Secretary-General to proceed with the much-needed reform and modernization of the Organization, as well as its modus operandi and decision-making processes, the lack of willingness on the part of the States I referred to has not allowed for the implementation of such a change.@@@Fifthly, as a result of the same political expediencies, the United Nations, unfortunately, adopts an equal-distance stance, even when faced with the violation of decisions, resolutions and defined scope and terms of reference specified to the Secretariat.@@@That results in emboldening offending States, which not only disregard international law but also create new precedents outside the framework of legality.@@@I have set out the main reasons for the lack of effectiveness, as well as the weakness, of the United Nations in living up to the expectations of billions of people.@@@I know that I may be considered a romantic ideologist, but I believe that the recent events and problems affecting the world do not leave any choice other than to take bold, but necessary decisions.@@@The first decision is to ensure the identification of the causes that lead to unnecessary rivalries and conflicts and the renewal of our commitment to a global order based on international law — a global order that ensures that peace, security, human rights and sustainable development remain the highest values, which we undertake to preserve and hold.@@@The second decision is to ensure the political will and determination to proceed with the reform and modernization of the United Nations into a just and efficient multilateral governance system.@@@That reform and modernization process becomes even more imperative and urgent with the imminent danger, after 77 years, of a new world war following the Russian aggression and Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.@@@My reference to the need for reforms to the structure and implementation mechanism of decisions taken by the United Nations arises not only from my assessment as to other international problems, but also from what my country still endures and suffers as a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.@@@It is with deep disappointment that I heard President Erdogan claiming that
“As a country, Tiirkiye wants all the issues in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean to be resolved within the framework of good-neighbourly relations and in conformity with international law.”@@@(A/77/PV.4, p.24).@@@How ironic is it for the Turkish President to put forward such a claim when every day he threatens to overtake Greek islands, or when he commits thousands of violations of the airspace of the sovereign and neighbouring country, contrary to international law?@@@How even more provocative is it to express the desire to resolve disputes “in conformity with international law” when he refuses to implement numerous resolutions of the United Nations on the Cyprus problem and creates new faits accompli?@@@How much in conformity with international law is his refusal to abide by, first, resolution 3212 (XXIX), adopted in October 1974, which urges the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and foreign military presence and personnel from the Republic of Cyprus and the cessation of all foreign interference in its affairs; secondly, resolution 365 (1974), which was endorsed by the Security Council in December of the same year; and thirdly, Security Council resolution 1251 (1999), which reaffirms the Council’s position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, international personality and citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded in a bizonal, bicommunal federation?@@@The latter resolution also stresses that such a settlement must exclude union, in whole or in part, with any other country or any form of partition or secession.@@@Last year, Mr. Erdogan claimed that efforts should concentrate on reaching a settlement based on the so- called realities on the ground (see A/76/PV.3), while this year he spoke about the need for everyone to “see the truth” and that there were “two distinct States and two distinct peoples on the island today”.@@@I am wondering as to which truth is he talking about?@@@Is it the truth that 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, a State member of the European Union, remains under military occupation?@@@Is it the truth that, after the Turkish invasion of 1974, one third of Greek Cypriots were forced to leave their ancestral homes?@@@Is it the truth that they have implanted hundreds of thousands of Turkish nationals in the occupied areas, thereby altering the demographic character of the island, turning the Turkish Cypriots into a minority in the areas that they illegally occupy?@@@Is it the truth that Turkey established an illegal entity in the occupied areas, which is under its absolute political, economic, social, cultural and religious control — an illegal entity, bear in mind, described by the European Court of Human Rights as a subordinate local administration of Turkey?@@@Is it the truth that Turkey tries to equate the State, the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, with the illegal secessionist entity?@@@Is it the truth that that proclamation of the purported secession was condemned by the Security Council and considered legally invalid?@@@Is it the truth that the Security Council called for its reversal and for all States and the international community as a whole not to accept it or in any way assist it?@@@Is it the truth that it is trying to change the status of the fenced city of Famagusta, contrary to Security Council resolutions 550 (1983) and 789 (1992)?@@@Is it the ruth that Turkey adopts its own arbitrary interpretation of international law, which reduces the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus by 44 per cent, at the expense of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?
As I noted earlier, when decisions or resolutions based on international law are not implemented or enforced, that, rightly so, could be perceived as fostering, or even rewarding, arbitrariness.@@@That is what we are actually witnessing today with the Cyprus problem.@@@Turkey, which systematically violates international law, calls on the international community to recognize its illegal faits accompli.@@@Unfortunately, that was the long-standing aim of Turkey ever since 1956.@@@That is why, despite
the historical compromises by the Greek Cypriot side, all efforts to reach a settlement of the Cyprus problem failed as a result of the intransigent stance and irrational demands of Turkey.@@@The latest example of this was the Conference on Cyprus held at Crans-Montana in July 2017.@@@In his report dated 28 September 2017, the Secretary-General offered his assessment of the proceedings at Crans-Montana with regard to the internal aspects of the Cyprus problem, stating that,
“[t]he core outstanding issues related to governance and power-sharing remained few ...”@@@(S/2017/814, para. 20)
and that
“[b]y the time the Conference closed, the sides had essentially solved the key issue of effective participation” (ibid., para. 27).@@@Therefore, while the aim of the Secretary-General to reach a strategic agreement was within close reach, the reason for the unsuccessful outcome was Turkey’s inflexible stance and its insistence on maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee, the right of intervention and a permanent presence of troops.@@@I would further like to recall the Secretary-General’s statement in June 2017, in which he stressed that,
“Progress in this chapter [on security and guarantees] is an essential element in reaching an overall agreement”.@@@Following a period of stalemate and despite our disappointment, we undertook new initiatives to resume the process where it was left off at Crans-Montana, culminating in the joint understanding reached with the Secretary-General and the then-leader of the Turkish Cypriots on 25 November 2019, which reaffirmed the principles for the resumption of a new round of talks, namely, the Joint Declaration of 11 February 2014, the prior convergences and the six-point framework the Secretary-General presented at Crans-Montana.@@@Regrettably, once again, Turkey undermined the prospect of resuming the negotiating process and, instead, at the meeting held in Geneva in April 2021, the Turks presented their position, which was to change the agreed basis of a settlement from a federal solution to a two-State solution.@@@Nonetheless, our side undertook another initiative, which also led to a new joint meeting of the leaders of the two communities with the Secretary-General in September 2021, during which it was agreed that the Secretary-General would proceed with the appointment of an envoy in order to deliberate with both sides and all interested parties, so as to reach common ground for a new peace process to resume.@@@Yet again, Turkey refused to uphold said agreement.@@@We also continued taking initiatives to break the impasse, including through a letter I sent to the Turkish Cypriot leader on 23 May 2022, by which I conveyed constructive proposals for the adoption of bold win-win confidence-building measures — measures that were immediately rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side, which submitted counter-proposals in line with their aim for a two-State solution.@@@Mrs. Gonzalez Lopez (El Salvador), Vice-President,
took the Chair.@@@Based on the foregoing, I believe that it is clear that the Greek Cypriot community has exerted and will continue to exert every possible effort for the resumption of talks, in order to reach a settlement based on the United Nations resolutions.@@@And as I have emphasized, the only way forward in resolving conflicts and for peace to prevail is none other than the unwavering adherence to international law and the United Nations Charter — and not as arbitrarily interpreted by those who seek to disguise their revisionist aspirations.@@@During my 10-year tenure as President of Cyprus, I may not have been able to enjoy what the vast majority would have also wished to see: the necessary reforms of this international Organization, the resolution of international conflicts and the tackling of such challenges that affect hundreds of millions of people as hunger, poverty and climate change.@@@I may have not been able to see my homeland reunited, with my Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot compatriots living in conditions of peace, prosperity and stability, but I earnestly hope that, during my lifetime, I will be able to witness a better and more stable future for humankind.@@@Trinidad and Tobago congratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and we commit ourselves to fully supporting you.@@@I also wish to express gratitude to your predecessor, whose leadership and dedication demonstrated that to be a great leader, one does not have to come from a large country.@@@In our maiden statement to the General Assembly as a newly independent nation in 1962, our first Permanent Representative, the late Sir Ellis Clarke, declared that Trinidad and Tobago embraces the solemn responsibility that comes with membership in this Organization (see A/PV.1122).@@@I stand before the General Assembly today, in our sixtieth year of independence, on the anniversary of the day on which we became a Republic, to reaffirm Trinidad and Tobago’s unequivocal acceptance of our obligation to honour the responsibility of membership in the United Nations.@@@Over the decades, Trinidad and Tobago has anchored its multilateral engagement on the founding purposes and principles of the United Nations.@@@We have nurtured these principles by maintaining a strong tradition of democratic governance that respects constitutionally enshrined fundamental human rights and freedoms and promotes strict adherence to the rule of law.@@@Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago is bound by duty to uphold these principles unconditionally and to defend them whenever there is evidence of breach.@@@That is why Trinidad and Tobago cannot accept or ignore any unilateral attempt to violate the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of any State.@@@The violation of Ukraine’s internationally agreed borders constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and of international law.@@@It is a clear threat to international peace and security, and the only credible solution is to end this aggression immediately.@@@We therefore call on the Russian Federation to immediately abandon its action and resume negotiations with the Ukrainians in good faith in order to find a peaceful and durable resolution.@@@Our collective experience over the last seven months has laid bare the urgent necessity for the Security Council to be reformed to reflect current geopolitical realities.@@@And as the international community celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC), evidence and events around the world confirm that, if in fact the court did not exist, it would have to be created in order to ensure accountability for increasing acts of impunity.@@@Trinidad and Tobago is proud of our long-standing involvement with the ICC through the pioneering work of our distinguished former Prime Minister and President — from the little island of Tobago — the late Arthur N. R. Robinson.@@@The mission of the International Criminal Court and its record as an independent tribunal engenders the fullest support of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@As the war in Ukraine rages, fuels such as coal are making quite a resurgence, and the commitments made in Glasgow are at risk of being severely derailed.@@@At the same time, climate commitments made by developed countries are definitely not on track.@@@Droughts, wildfires, floods and cataclysmic hurricanes and typhoons are realities that small island States know all too well.@@@Meanwhile, slow-onset events such as the deterioration of coral reefs and the influx of sargassum seaweed threaten our fragile ecosystems and the livelihoods of all people, especially of fisherfolk and those dependent on tourism.@@@Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago calls for the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.@@@A dedicated facility to address loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change financial mechanism is an absolute necessity.@@@These actions must be prioritized because what is at stake is the very existence and viability of small island States.@@@The added burden of rampant global inflation and the crises of food, fuel, feed and fertilizers have placed an extraordinary strain on our economies and our people, further imperilling our ability to attain sustainable development across the globe.@@@On the critical issue of achieving food security for all people, the international community must work together to accelerate global food production.@@@In this regard, leaders of the country members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have not just been calling for action, but they have been acting in solidarity and with decisiveness.@@@In August, Trinidad and Tobago was pleased to host the second CARICOM Agri Investment Forum and Expo as part of our region’s commitment to reducing its food-import bill by 25 per cent by the year 2025.@@@Trinidad and Tobago is firmly committed to working with CARICOM and other partners towards restoring peace and stable democratic governance in Haiti.@@@Our objective must be to work with the Haitians to secure their long-term progress and future.@@@We therefore call upon the United Nations system and the international donor community to urgently strengthen their rule and engagement with Haiti.@@@We encourage them to provide the necessary assistance to quell the ongoing and devastating gang violence and to urgently improve the humanitarian situation in that beautiful country.@@@In the Caribbean, our efforts to build safe and peaceful societies are being completely undermined by transnational organized crime, human trafficking, the illicit trade of drugs and a steady flow of illegal firearms from source countries far beyond our region — all of which contributes to unacceptably high levels of gang violence within our communities.@@@We are further committed to strengthening our cooperation with regional and international partners to address these challenges, which threaten the very stability of our societies.@@@Violent extremism, international terrorism and the use of technology for criminal purposes remain clear and present dangers.@@@In combating these phenomena, Trinidad and Tobago attaches the highest value to collaborating with the United Nations and other international partners.@@@We must bear in mind that in addressing extremism there must be no compromise to the constitutionally protected rights and freedoms of our citizens.@@@In all of these complexities, we must recognize the critically important role of women as agents of positive change.@@@To that end, Trinidad and Tobago will once again submit the biennial resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control.@@@We encourage all Member States to co-sponsor and support this forward-looking resolution.@@@But while we assiduously work to encourage and ensure the inclusion of women in places and spaces of decision-making, we must continue to insist that the rights of women and girls are fully respected at all levels of society.@@@Violence against women and girls continues to be a menace, destroying lives and impeding overall progress towards balanced and inclusive sustainable development.@@@Addressing this must be a priority, and, in Trinidad and Tobago, a growing number of stakeholders, including the private sector, have now joined the national effort to make our society safe for women and girls.@@@The last two years in particular have demonstrated that the structure of the international economic and financial system is not fit for purpose.@@@The system as designed actually undermines developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development.@@@It cannot be business as usual.@@@A transformative global agenda, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, necessitates a transformative economic and financial framework that is compatible with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Without such a shift in the global architecture, even the best efforts at the national level will not produce the results that we need in the global South.@@@Trinidad and Tobago calls on the international community to adopt tailored measures and solutions to address the fundamental financing challenges that developing countries face, with particular attention to the least developed countries and small island developing States.@@@One such measure is the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index, which we consider to be an utmost priority.@@@Our history cannot be rewritten or erased.@@@We therefore continue to call for reparatory justice for the unpaid debt resulting from centuries of enslavement
of African people, for the historical crimes of native genocide visited upon the indigenous peoples of this world and for the exploitative legacy of colonialism that has directly resulted in the persistent underdevelopment of Caribbean nations and so many others.@@@We continue to call for abandoning and destroying all nuclear weapons as the only means of guaranteeing the avoidance of total annihilation of humankind.@@@We continue to call for the unconditional lifting of the unjust economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on the people of Cuba, and for the full integration of Cuba into the international economic and political system.@@@We also continue to call for a long-lasting and mutually agreed two-State solution to the Israel-@@@Palestine conflict, which will guarantee Palestinians a permanent homeland and recognize Israel’s right to exist in peace and security.@@@To get the 2030 Agenda back on track, all stakeholders — whether large or small, powerful or otherwise — must embrace the value of multilateralism.@@@Clearly, we are not quite there yet.@@@In this regard, I echo the words of one of Trinidad and Tobago’s greatest calypsonians, David Rudder, who in his iconic song “Rally ‘round the West Indies”, wrote
“Soon we must take a side or be lost in the rubble
In a divided world that don’t need islands no more
Are doomed forever to be at somebody’s mercy?@@@Little keys can open up mighty doors”.@@@This world needs little islands.@@@We bring a perspective that is valuable and beneficial and necessary.@@@Trinidad and Tobago continues to offer the point of view of a small, sovereign democratic nation harbouring a big ambition, namely, to unleash the creativity and resourcefulness of our diverse people, especially our youth, to make the most positive contribution to society, community and the world.@@@As a relatively young nation, Trinidad and Tobago’s people are our greatest source of power and energy.@@@It can be felt in the rhythm of our beautiful Tassa drums and in the melodies of our national instrument, the steelpan.@@@Our achievements stand as testimony of what can be achieved when a small nation punches above its weight.@@@Our citizens have served as judges at the ICC and at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and we have given the world experts of the calibre of Lennox Fitzroy Ballah and Anthony Amos Lucky.@@@We have contributed extensively to the work of the United Nations, serving on the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and a range of subsidiary bodies and organs.@@@Trinidad and Tobago looks forward with enthusiasm and optimism to our next 60 years of membership of the United Nations.@@@We continue to deepen engagement and partnership with our neighbours in the Caribbean and with all members of the international community in order to achieve our common objectives and thereby strengthen international peace and security.@@@As we write the next chapter in our nation’s history, I can share with the Assembly that Trinidad and Tobago offers itself to serve as President of the General Assembly during its seventy-eighth session.@@@Being tasked with such a defining role by the Assembly would truly be an honour and responsibility that the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago shall embrace with commitment and impartiality.@@@In the best traditions of multilateralism, let us therefore join our strengths for the benefit and upliftment of all humankind.@@@Let us build a truly global community where no one is left behind.@@@In conclusion, I offer the General Assembly the inspiration found in the words of the national motto of Trinidad and Tobago, which declares: “Together we aspire; together we achieve”.@@@I would like to greet the Secretary-General, whom I have the renewed pleasure of addressing in our common language.@@@I begin by congratulating you, Ambassador Csaba Korosi, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@You can count on the support of Brazil.@@@The theme chosen for this general debate revolves around a concept that perfectly applies to the moment we live in: a watershed.@@@Our collective responsibility in the General Assembly is to understand the scope of the challenges that make up this watershed moment and, from there, to build responses that pull their strength from the objectives shared by us all.@@@The task is not simple.@@@But strictly speaking, we have no alternative.@@@The effort must begin within each of our countries.@@@First of all, it is what we do at the domestic level that gives the measure of the authority with which we act at the international level.@@@Allow me to speak from my country’s perspective.@@@When Brazil expresses its positions on the public health agenda, we do so with the authority of a Government that, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, spared no effort to save lives and preserve jobs.@@@Like many other countries, we focused our attention from the very beginning on ensuring emergency financial assistance to those most in need.@@@Our goal was to protect families’ income so that they could face the economic hardships resulting from the pandemic.@@@We helped more than 68 million people, the equivalent of one third of our population.@@@In tandem, we launched a broad vaccination programme, including the domestic production of vaccines.@@@We are a nation of more than 210 million people, and already more than 80 per cent of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19.@@@All were vaccinated voluntarily, in full respect of each person’s freedom of choice.@@@Likewise, economically Brazil has the authority of a country that, for the sake of sustainable and inclusive growth, has been implementing reforms to attract investment and improve the living conditions of its population.@@@During my Administration, we uprooted the systemic corruption that existed in the country.@@@Between 2003 and 2015 alone, the period in which the left presided in Brazil, the debt level of Petrobras due to poor management, politically driven appointments and favours, as well as the diversion of funds, reached $170 billion.@@@The person responsible was convicted unanimously in three court cases.@@@Whistle-blowers returned $1 billion, and we paid the United States stock market another $1 billion due to losses incurred by shareholders.@@@But that is the Brazil of the past.@@@We upgraded public services by reducing costs and investing in science and technology.@@@Nowadays, for instance, Brazil is the seventh most digitally advanced country in the world, with 135 million people accessing 4,900 services provided by my Administration.@@@Brazil was a pioneer in the deployment of 5G in Latin America.@@@We implemented a comprehensive agenda of privatizations and concessions, with an emphasis on infrastructure.@@@We have concluded the Transfer of the Sao Francisco River project, bringing water to the Brazilian north-east.@@@We adopted new regulatory frameworks, such as in basic sanitation, railroads and natural gas.@@@Moreover, we improved the business environment, with the economic freedom law and the start-up law.@@@As a result, we created opportunities for young people to be entrepreneurs and have quality jobs.@@@Crowning all those efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy, we are making great strides towards Brazil’s entry as a full member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.@@@Despite the global crisis, Brazil is reaching the end of 2022 with an economy in full recovery.@@@We have high employment and a low inflation rate.@@@The economy is growing again.@@@Poverty increased across the world as a result of the pandemic.@@@In Brazil, it has already begun to fall sharply.@@@The figures speak for themselves.@@@It is estimated that, by the end of 2022, 4 per cent of Brazilian families will be living below the extreme poverty line.@@@In 2019, it was 5.1 per cent.@@@That represents a drop of more than 20 per cent.@@@Auxilio Brasil, the minimum-income programme established by my Administration during the pandemic, which reaches 20 million families, pays them almost $4 a day.@@@Unemployment fell by 5 percentage points, reaching 9 per cent — a rate not seen for seven years.@@@We reduced inflation to an estimated 6 per cent this year.@@@I am pleased to announce that we had unprecedented deflation in Brazil in the months of July and August.@@@Since June, the price of gasoline has dropped by more than 30 per cent.@@@Today a litre of gasoline in Brazil costs about $0.90.@@@The price of electricity also fell by more than 15 per cent.@@@Let me stress that the cost of energy did not drop because of price-fixing or any other type of State intervention.@@@It was the result of a tax-rationalization policy formulated and implemented with the support of the National Congress of Brazil.@@@In 2021, Brazil was the fourth-largest destination for foreign direct investment in the world.@@@Our foreign trade reached the historic milestone of 39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), even after reducing taxes or lowering them to zero on thousands of products.@@@Domestically, we are also breaking records in three areas — tax collection, State-owned company profits and the public debt-to-GDP ratio.@@@In fact, in 2021 we had a surplus in the consolidated result of national accounts.@@@Brazilian GDP increased by 1.2 per cent in the second quarter.@@@The forecast for 2022 is 3 per cent growth.@@@We have the peace of mind of being on the right path — the path to prosperity shared among Brazilians
and, beyond that, with our neighbours and other partners around the world.@@@That is what we see, for example, in food production.@@@Four decades ago, Brazil used to import food.@@@Today we are one of the world’s largest exporters.@@@That was only possible thanks to heavy investments in science and innovation, with a view to increasing productivity and sustainability.@@@I pay tribute to Alysson Paolinelli, Brazilian candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, for his role in expanding the Brazilian agricultural frontier through the use of new technologies.@@@This year the country has already started the largest grain harvest in our history.@@@We estimate it to be at least 270 million tons.@@@In a few years, Brazil will also make the transition from importer to exporter of wheat.@@@For the period 2022 to 2023, total production is expected to exceed 300 million tons.@@@On a recent visit to Brazil, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization stated that if it were not for Brazilian agribusiness, the planet would go hungry, as we feed more than 1 billion people worldwide.@@@Our agribusiness is a source of national pride.@@@I also note that, in the area of sustainable development, Brazil’s achievements lend credibility to our country’s international action.@@@With regard to the environment and sustainable development, Brazil is part of the solution and a reference for the world.@@@Two thirds of Brazilian territory is host to native vegetation, which is exactly as it was when Brazil was discovered in 1500.@@@In the Brazilian Amazon, an area equivalent to all of Western Europe, more than 80 per cent of the forest remains untouched, contrary to what is reported by the mainstream national and international media.@@@It is essential that, when taking care of the environment, we do not overlook people.@@@The Amazon region is home to more than 20 million inhabitants, including indigenous and riverside dwellers, whose livelihoods depend on economic use of the forest.@@@We brought the Internet to more than 11,000 rural schools and more than 500 indigenous communities.@@@Brazil began its energy transition almost half a century ago, in reaction to the oil crises at that time.@@@Today we have a modern and sustainable biofuel industry.@@@That industry contributes to the cleanest energy mix among the Group of 20 countries.@@@About 84 per cent of our electricity matrix is currently renewable — a goal that many developed countries hope to achieve only by 2040 or 2050.@@@Last year, Brazil was chosen by the United Nations as the global champion of energy transition.@@@We have the potential to become a major global exporter of clean energy.@@@We have a surplus, already under construction, that can reach more than 100 gigawatts between biomass, onshore wind and solar, in addition to the unexplored opportunity of 700-gigawatt offshore wind farms, with one of the lowest production costs in the world.@@@Those sources will produce green hydrogen for export.@@@Part of this 100 per cent clean energy opens up the possibility for us to become suppliers of highly competitive industrial products, especially in the Brazilian north-east, with one of the smallest carbon footprints in the world.@@@The sustainable development agenda is impacted in many ways by threats to international peace and security.@@@We built the United Nations from the ruins of the Second World War.@@@What motivated us back then was the determination to avoid repeating the cycle of destruction that marked the first half of the twentieth century.@@@To some extent, we can say that we were successful.@@@But today the conflict in Ukraine serves as a warning.@@@A reform of the United Nations is essential if we are to find world peace.@@@In the specific case of the Security Council, after 25 years of debates, it is clear that we need to look for innovative solutions.@@@Brazil delves into this topic based on experience that goes back to the beginnings of the United Nations.@@@This is the eleventh time that we have held a non-permanent seat at the Council.@@@We have tried to do our best to achieve peaceful and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, always led by the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@Brazil also has an extensive history of participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@From Suez to Angola, from Haiti to Lebanon, we have always supported peacekeeping.@@@We also contributed to peace by opening our borders to those seeking a chance to restart their lives in our country.@@@Since 2018, over 6 million Venezuelan brothers have been forced to leave their country.@@@Many of them came to Brazil.@@@Our response to that challenge was “Operation Welcome”, which has become an international benchmark.@@@More than 350,000 Venezuelans have found in Brazilian territory emergency assistance, protection, documentation and
the possibility of a fresh start.@@@All of them have access to the labour market, to public services and social benefits.@@@In recent months, around 600 Venezuelans have been arriving in Brazil every day on foot, the vast majority of them being women and children weighing on average 15 kilos less than before and running away from violence and hunger.@@@The Brazilian humanitarian reception policy goes beyond Venezuela.@@@We have also received Haitians, Syrians, Afghans and Ukrainians.@@@It has been seven months since the conflict began in Ukraine.@@@It is a source of great concern — not only in Europe but throughout the world.@@@I would like, first, to reiterate Brazil’s gratitude to the countries that helped with the evacuation of Brazilian citizens who were in Ukraine when the conflict started.@@@I refer especially to Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic.@@@The operation was successful.@@@We left no one behind, not even their pets.@@@With regard to the conflict itself, Brazil has been guided by the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter.@@@Those principles are also enshrined in our Constitution.@@@We call for an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and non-combatants, the preservation of critical infrastructure in order to assist the population and the maintenance of all channels of dialogue between the parties in conflict.@@@Those are the first steps to achieving a lasting and sustainable solution.@@@We have been working towards that goal.@@@At the United Nations and elsewhere, we have tried to avoid the hampering of dialogue channels caused by the polarization around the conflict.@@@In that regard, we are against diplomatic and economic isolation.@@@The fallout of the conflict can already be felt in world prices for foodstuffs, fuel and other raw materials.@@@This situation distances us all from the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Countries that once presented themselves as leaders of the low-carbon economy have now turned to dirty sources of energy.@@@That is a serious setback for the environment.@@@We support all efforts to reduce the economic impact of this crisis, but we do not believe that the best way is to adopt unilateral and selective sanctions that are inconsistent with international law.@@@Those measures have hampered the economic recovery and undermined the human rights of vulnerable populations, including in European countries.@@@The conflict in Ukraine can be resolved only through negotiation and dialogue.@@@I make a plea to the parties, as well as to the entire international community, to not pass up any opportunity to end the conflict and ensure peace.@@@The stability, security and prosperity of humankind are at serious risk if the conflict continues.@@@I have been an unconditional supporter of the freedom of speech.@@@Moreover, under my Administration, Brazil has made an effort to bring the right to the freedom of religion to the core of the international human rights agenda.@@@It is essential to ensure that everyone has the right to freely worship and practice their religious orientation without discrimination.@@@I would like to state here that Brazil is ready to welcome the Catholic priests and nuns who have suffered cruel persecution by the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua.@@@Brazil repudiates religious persecution wherever it occurs in the world.@@@Other fundamental values for Brazilian society with implications for the human rights agenda are the defence of the family, the right to life after conception, the right to self-defence and the rejection of gender ideology.@@@I would also like to stress our commitment to women’s rights.@@@Our effort to enact over 70 legal norms on the subject since the beginning of my Administration, in 2019, is proof of that commitment.@@@We resolutely combat violence against women.@@@That is part of our broader priority of ensuring public security for all Brazilians.@@@The results can be seen in our Government — a 7.7 per cent drop in the number of femicides and a decrease in the general number of deaths by homicide.@@@In 2017, there were 30 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants; now there are only 19.@@@Violence in rural areas has also plummeted, and land tenure by the most in need has increased.@@@Under my Administration, we delivered 400,000 rural property deeds, 80 per cent to women.@@@We are making efforts in Brazil to have strong and independent women so they can reach their goals.@@@Since 2019, First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro has brought new meaning to volunteer work, with special attention to people with disabilities and rare diseases.@@@On 7 September, Brazil celebrated 200 years of history as an independent nation.@@@Millions of Brazilians took to the streets, called upon by their Government, wearing the colours of their flag.@@@It was the largest civic demonstration in the history of our country, a people that believes in God, nation, family and freedom.@@@At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly and to express to him, on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, our support for his work for the benefit of the international community.@@@May this seventy- seventh session allow us to continue strengthening multilateralism to more effectively confront the new and old threats that beset humankind.@@@Today, we are facing a multiple and systemic crisis of capitalism that increasingly endangers the life of humankind and the planet.@@@There is no doubt that the challenges we are facing are becoming more complex every day.@@@If we seek a better future for current and future generations, we must not only reflect on the economic, social, food, climate, energy, water and trade crises, but also clearly identify their origins so as to change a system that perpetuates the domination, exploitation and exclusion of the vast majority, generates the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and prioritizes the production and reproduction of capital over the creation and reproduction of life.@@@At the same time that we face the multiple and systemic crisis of capitalism, we are witnessing the final chapter of the unipolar world.@@@The construction of a new world order, which we hope will be for the benefit of all States and peoples of the world, is inevitable.@@@Convinced that another world is possible, we in the Plurinational State of Bolivia propose the following.@@@First, we should declare the world a zone of peace.@@@In that connection, we express our dismay at the considerable number of armed conflicts ravaging humankind, many of them promoted by transnational military corporations, as well as by the desire to impose a global political and economic order that benefits the interests of capitalism.@@@Those conflicts have a great human cost and, in many cases, lead to the destruction of our cultural and environmental heritage.@@@Regardless of the origin, nature or geopolitical reasons for international tensions, the Plurinational State of Bolivia has been and will remain committed to a culture of dialogue among nations, through diplomacy among peoples.@@@Unfortunately, however, we are seeing the growing deterioration of the multilateral system due to the capricious failure of the capitalist Powers to acquiesce to the existence of a multipolar world with a balance of power.@@@Multilateralism is the only mechanism that represents a guarantee of respect among States, regardless of their economic or military power.@@@We therefore believe that any breach of international peace and security is linked to the insufficient application of the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or, failing that, to their flagrant violation.@@@In 2014, the countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States declared the region a zone of peace.@@@We committed ourselves to settling our disputes peacefully and banishing forever the use of force in the region.@@@Along those lines, we call for the Assembly to be the space for a great historic agreement — an agreement in which dialogue and diplomacy prevail over any dispute — and for the world to also be declared a zone of peace.@@@To achieve that goal, it is vitally important, among several initiatives, for the United Nations to work tirelessly to achieve a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, for the historic rights of the people and State of Palestine to be respected, and for NATO to stop entertaining its expansionist plans.@@@Secondly, we should replace the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction with fair compensation to the world’s poor.@@@It is precisely the lack of dialogue and measures of preventive diplomacy that has dragged us into an era of great tensions worldwide and of growing uncertainties and instability in global security.@@@We are living in times in which there is a concentration of a large number of weapons of mass destruction in a small group of countries, which, by refusing to eliminate them and prioritizing their geopolitical interests, are endangering the peace and security of our planet.@@@Nine countries today have 12,705 nuclear warheads, 9,440 of which are in military stockpiles, ready to be used.@@@Given this frightening reality facing the world, we must raise the banner of replacing military spending on the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction with the fair economic compensation that the main capitalist countries owe, morally and historically, to the countries of the periphery and the world’s poor countries.@@@Thirdly, we oppose the commodification of health care and favour universal health-care systems.@@@In the past two years, our peoples have had to face not only uncertainty resulting from conflicts, but also a serious health crisis resulting from the coronavirus disease, which exposed the vulnerabilities and inequalities of health-care systems around the world, as well as of the financial system and the global economy.@@@In the face of health-care systems that benefit only those able to access private insurance, and in opposition to those who have turned health into a commodity, it is imperative to strengthen universal health-care systems in which the State meets its obligation to protect and guarantee collective rights, within the framework of the pre-eminence of economic, social and cultural human rights, thereby reducing the effects of the global economic crisis on the most vulnerable sectors of the population.@@@Fourthly, we need a global food sovereignty programme that is in harmony with Mother Earth.@@@Another manifestation of the structural and multipronged crisis of capitalism is the food crisis, which is exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic, global geopolitical conflicts and the numerous environmental crises facing the planet.@@@This situation has not only affected the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, but also threatens the most basic rights of millions of human beings.@@@According to the 2022 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, the number of people suffering from hunger in the world has increased dramatically over the past few years.@@@In 2021 alone, a total of 828 million people, accounting for 9.8 per cent of the world’s population, were the victims of food insecurity.@@@Asia, with 425 million people affected by the food crisis, and Africa, with 278 million affected, remain the regions hardest hit by the crisis.@@@In Latin America and the Caribbean, the food crisis has affected more than 56 million people.@@@To address the food crisis, we must urgently implement a global food sovereignty programme that ensures better production conditions for small- scale farmers.@@@That means access to seeds, fertilizer, technology, infrastructure, credit and private and community-based access of all kinds to markets.@@@It also means better living conditions in their communities, in full harmony with Mother Earth.@@@Fifth, we must rebuild the productive and economic capacities of the countries of the periphery hard hit by the unrestrained logic of the concentration of capital.@@@In addition to the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic, which has degraded our economies and business transactions, today we are on an expansionary path, sustained by inflation, which has become a critical problem.@@@For example, in August, the United States recorded annual inflation of 8.25 per cent, the highest in the past four decades, and there was unprecedented inflation rate of 9.1 per cent in the Eurozone.@@@In addition, the war between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated pressure on the price of energy, food, fertilizer, commodities and other products.@@@In July this year, interannual inflation with respect to food reached double digits in some countries of Europe and in the United States.@@@In an interconnected world, it is important to respond to the needs of our peoples in the post-pandemic context by strengthening integration and cooperation, based on the principles of solidarity, complementarity and respect for the self-determination of peoples.@@@In so doing, we can address the multidimensional effect on the economy and our industries, as well as on our productive capacities and self-sufficiency.@@@To that end, it is essential that we restructure the global financial architecture to ease the external debt burden globally so that developing countries have an opportunity to implement, in a sovereign manner, social policies with a focus on comprehensive and sustainable economic and social development.@@@As always, the countries of the South are calling for balance in trade relations, as current trade relations continue to benefit only countries of the North.@@@In that regard, I would like to humbly share Bolivia’s experience.@@@Following the restoration of democracy in 2020, thanks to the unity, struggle and conscience of our people, we returned to the path charted by our democratic and cultural revolution, dignity and sovereignty.@@@We resumed the construction
of our plurinational State and the consolidation of our economic, social and community-based production model.@@@It is a sovereign economic model.@@@We have not accepted and will never accept measures that are imposed by the International Monetary Fund.@@@Our economic model reflects our political, economic, social and cultural reality and is based on the active role of the State in the economy, the nationalization of our strategic natural resources, the development of economic organization of all kinds, increased public investment, import substitution industrialization, the revitalization of the domestic market, product diversification, food security and sovereignty, income redistribution and the fight against poverty and inequality.@@@In other words, we seek economic growth with social justice, inspired by our civilizing political objective to ensure that our people live comfortably, which has its origins in our indigenous roots.@@@Such responsible and sovereign policies have enabled us to return to the path of stability, economic growth and income redistribution.@@@In the first quarter of 2022, economic activity increased by 4 per cent, fuelled by domestic demand.@@@Our inflation rate stood at 1.6 per cent in August.@@@Our economy has the lowest inflation rate in the region and one of the lowest in the world, compared to the inflation rates of various countries that, over the past 12 months, have exceeded double digits.@@@With regard to social development, in the second quarter of 2022 Bolivia recorded the lowest unemployment rate in the region — 4.5 per cent.@@@International organizations, such as the Economic Commission for Latin America, have listed us as the country leading in poverty rate reduction in 2022, while poverty rates in other countries will increase.@@@However, as with many other periphery countries, we continue to make herculean efforts to solve issues related to the multidimensional and systemic crisis affecting us, making our recovery increasingly challenging.@@@We deplore the fact that, while capitalist countries spend copious amounts of money on war, they make miniscule contributions to comprehensive sustainable development, decolonization, elimination of the patriarchy and the eradication of poverty and economic and social inequalities.@@@One example is that in recent months, 20 times more financial resources were earmarked for the conflict in Eastern Europe than were pledged to the Green Climate Fund over the past decade.@@@Peace is achieved not by buying and selling weapons, but rather by working together to build and, if necessary, rebuild the economic and productive capacities of all countries.@@@Sixth, the climate crisis requires accountability, solidarity and harmony between human beings and nature, not profit-seeking.@@@Another crisis that threatens to destroy humankind and the integrity of our Mother Earth is the climate crisis, which is leading towards environmental collapse.@@@The discouraging rates of emissions reductions that have been observed and estimated to date demonstrate that countries with the means to change their production and consumption patterns do not have the political will to do so.@@@Those that have set ambitious targets for themselves have not received the means for implementation, as promised in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to achieve those targets.@@@Furthermore, those that are mainly to blame for greenhouse gas emissions are now asking each country to chase the illusion of decarbonization by 2050, without considering the past responsibilities of developed countries or the capabilities and limitations of developing countries, for whom access to the latest clean technologies is out of reach.@@@Perhaps the historic climate debtors want us all to be concerned only about the future so as to avoid, in the present, talking about the unfulfilled promises that were made to developing countries on funding, technology transfer and capacity-building.@@@The recent flooding in Pakistan, to whose people we offer our solidarity, serves as the most vivid and tangible example of the high human and material cost of the loss and damage caused by centuries of poor capitalist development.@@@Today, more than ever before, it is clear that we need a specific financial mechanism that is based on solidarity, and not on profit-seeking, to address the losses and damage caused by the climate crisis in countries engaged in intense development of their productive forces.@@@We firmly believe that a future that is low in emissions and resilient to the climate crisis will not be possible if wealth remains concentrated in the hands of a few.@@@Therefore, to reverse the climate crisis, we must resolve the economic, social and political contradictions that have been created by the capitalist model, as well as those human beings and nature.@@@Seventh, we must focus on the industrialization of lithium for the benefit of peoples and as a key pillar for the energy transition.@@@I am referring to a strategic natural resource.@@@Our country possesses the largest reserves of lithium in the world.@@@We have managed this resource very responsibly, in particular as we take steps towards its industrialization, while ensuring that it is used to benefit all humankind as a key pillar of a global and just transition to a future that is low in emissions and respectful of Mother Earth.@@@We do not want our reserves of lithium to follow the path of other natural resources that, under conditions of colonialism and capitalist development, serve only to enrich a few and foment hunger among peoples.@@@Bearing that in mind, we have consolidated our sovereignty over our natural resources, such as lithium.@@@Its industrialization and benefits are for the well-being of peoples, not to enrich transnationals or a small, privileged group.@@@We retain sovereign ownership of the economic surplus, which should be distributed among the lowest-income earners in the population.@@@We also reject interference or attempts of any kind to destabilize our country’s democracy with the goal of controlling our lithium.@@@According to remarks by the commander of the United States Southern Command just a couple of months ago, the United States has the so-called lithium triangle, located in South America, formed by Bolivia, Argentina and Chile, in its sights.@@@The United Nations must take measures against all those countries that do not respect sovereignty and the principle of non-interference and that challenge peoples to take control of their strategic natural resources.@@@We are not pieces on a chessboard.@@@We are peoples who work, day in and day out, to move ahead, and we have every right to make decisions about our natural resources.@@@Eighth, we must shift from nationalizing to regionalizing the fight against drug trafficking.@@@We must change our approach to the fight against drug trafficking.@@@We continue to focus only on supply and not on demand and that has served as a pretext for militarization and the waging of a global war on drugs.@@@That has affected the farmers of the global South, while major criminal groups go unpunished, as they have never been publicly identified in the countries where drugs are consumed.@@@The global war against drugs criminalizes and leads to unilateral sanctions against countries of the South.@@@However, it provides opportunities for asset-laundering, facilitates drug trafficking and other related crimes in the countries of the North.@@@That cannot continue.@@@Having enjoyed positive results in the fight against drug trafficking, Bolivia defends its model.@@@We believe that the time has come to work with Peru, Colombia and other countries affected by the transit of drugs to regionalize the fight against drug trafficking, based on a comprehensive approach that is less militarized and more focused on economic and social issues.@@@Here at the United Nations, we must work on a mechanism to assess results, not only in countries of the South, but also in countries of the North, one of which unilaterally endorses the war on drugs.@@@Ninth, we must strengthen international mechanisms offering preferential treatment to landlocked countries.@@@Allow me to draw the Assembly’s attention to the law of the sea, which is now a major issue in international legal relations.@@@All landlocked or isolated States have serious challenges in accessing the sea and taking advantage of its resources and marine areas have considerable development potential for countries, in particular developing countries.@@@All countries have the right of access and use of oceans, seas and marine resources, as stated in the Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@We must ensure a just distribution of rights and responsibilities with respect to marine resources, which play a decisive role for the future of the peoples of the world.@@@The sea is a right of all peoples, and no one should be prevented from enjoying that right or using it for development purposes.@@@Therefore, guided by the principles of equality, non-discrimination, international solidarity and social justice to rectify imbalances and global injustice, we believe that it is important to strengthen international mechanisms to provide preferential treatment to States that have no sea coasts and are therefore at a severe geographical disadvantage with regard to taking advantage of marine resources.@@@It has been proven that landlocked countries are at a double disadvantage.@@@It costs us more to import products and we face major obstacles in our development.@@@In that regard, we must remind the international community that my country, Bolivia, was created with access to the sea, However, it is now a landlocked country, compelled by past circumstances to address various challenges in the areas of transport, communication and trade.@@@We hope that, sooner rather than later, dialogue and diplomacy will triumph to right the injustices of a war imposed by capitalist interests and build a better future for kindred nations.@@@Tenth, we must enlarge our limited view of human rights and democracy.@@@There is no doubt that democracy and human rights are inseparable.@@@The Plurinational State of Bolivia experienced for itself that, when democracy is undermined, the very foundation for the enjoyment of human rights is also undermined.@@@That is why we are most firmly committed to the decisions and actions taken by the Organization to protect the most vulnerable groups in our society.@@@Bolivia has decided to rebuild its institutions by incorporating the plurinational nature of our State, which means that our 36 indigenous peoples are an integral part of our State.@@@A nation that is proud of its diverse identity can build a better country, based on its intercultural nature.@@@Bolivian men and women know that.@@@From the historical perspective, this has occurred in very short order and our challenge is to ensure that the transformation continues, with the goal of ensuring that everyone lives comfortably.@@@We must expand our criteria for human rights in relation to democracy.@@@Neither human rights nor democracy can exist if the privileges of the few are preserved at the cost of the economic, social and cultural rights of the majority.@@@Eleventh, concerning intergenerational solidarity, we firmly believe that the current vibrant and productive generation must show solidarity with those who have laid the foundation of our nations.@@@We cannot ensure equality among generations if we do not consolidate equality among present generations.@@@We are concerned about the overemphasis on future generations in the multilateral sphere without considering all the work done by the older people in our countries.@@@We are concerned about the fact that, to date, there is no universal treaty that protects older people.@@@We hope that in-depth reflection on this issue can take place at the Organization.@@@Twelfth, we must proclaim a decade of action for depatriarchalization in order to combat all forms of violence against women and girls.@@@In the same vein, I would like to draw attention to a cause for alarm at the global level — the violence that continues against women and girls, particularly indigenous women and girls and those living in poverty.@@@The pandemic and the structural crises of capitalism are degrading living conditions, especially for women in rural and urban areas, who continue to face complex and intersectional forms of violence.@@@The Gender Snapshot 2022 report issued by UN- Women and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which evaluates the annual progress on the nine targets of Sustainable Development Goal 5, points out that
“Gender discrimination has long relegated women and girls to positions subordinate to men in the workplace, politics and the home [...] and it will take at least another 21 years for laws to address and prevent violence against women to be in place everywhere and 286 years to secure gender equality in legal frameworks based on the current rate of change.”@@@The report also notes a worrisome setback in progress in poverty reduction and that rising prices are likely to exacerbate the trend.@@@By the end of 2022, some 383 million women and girls will live in extreme poverty.@@@Many other women in most parts of the world will not have an income sufficient to meet basic needs, such as food, clothing and adequate housing.@@@Mrs. Gonzalez Lopez (El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.@@@Our Plurinational State of Bolivia has declared 2022 the year of the cultural revolution for depatriarchalization for a life free from violence against women.@@@We are promoting policies aimed not only at strengthening regulatory frameworks, but also at tackling the structural causes of violence through education and strengthening women’s economic independence, as well as through cultural processes, in order to change the unfortunate reality created by the oldest system of oppression, the patriarchy, which sustains itself through colonialism and capitalism.@@@We call for the General Assembly to proclaim a decade of depatriarchalization.@@@We refer to depatriarchalization because it is a complex process that requires community-wide political, economic, social and cultural change aimed at building reciprocal relationships for a life free from all forms of exclusion, dominance, exploitation, discrimination and violence for all of humankind and our Mother Earth.@@@Thirteenth, we must reject unilateral sanctions.@@@It is inconceivable that in a world hit by crises and the pandemic that unilateral coercive measures are still being applied with the aim of breaking Governments at the expense of the hunger and suffering of their peoples.@@@In the current global context, no country should be
persecuted, sanctioned or cornered for exercising its right to freely determine its own political, economic and social systems.@@@Putting Bolivia on a list of major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries is one example of the unilateral actions that some countries have taken.@@@The Plurinational State of Bolivia has a sovereign policy on combating drug trafficking that has yielded important results, and we reaffirm our Government’s commitment to strengthening the fight against that global scourge.@@@However, it is clear that the war on drugs — primarily the one unleashed by the United States — has failed.@@@That country therefore urgently needs to thoroughly consider changing its policies in view of the fact that it has become one of the major drug-consuming countries.@@@Regrettably, during the previous administration, more than 100,000 people died of overdoses or drug addiction in the United States.@@@Another clear example of ongoing unilateral sanctions is the inhumane and criminal commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which threatens the lives of millions of citizens.@@@Maintaining such measures is a crime against humanity — not to mention that the United States designates Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism.@@@That unfortunate example should also give us pause to reflect on the fact that some countries do not comply with the majority of the decisions taken every year in the Assembly.@@@Finally, we must ensure the full application of the Charter of the United Nations and the principle of multilateralism.@@@If we, the international community, cannot overcome the major problems we are facing, we will lead our peoples to a mass catastrophe.@@@Fulfilling our responsibility to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Charter, as well as international law and the institutions it governs, is more crucial than ever.@@@The multidirectional crisis the planet is suffering because of capitalist ambition — and we are far from overcoming it — will worsen if we do not take urgent measures.@@@Only by strengthening multilateralism can we achieve greater dialogue and cooperation in seeking solutions to the crisis.@@@Revitalizing multilateralism in earnest will allow us to restore the legitimacy of international law, ensure peace through social justice and reshape the fragile international order to make it pluralistic and solid.@@@Based on the experience it has accumulated since its democratic and cultural revolution in 2006, the Plurinational State of Bolivia is hopeful that we will overcome the current polarization in the global architecture — as well as the capitalist world order that has left us in a dizzying, dangerous, never-ending race of consumerism that threatens humankind and the planet — and build, in its place, a more just, inclusive and equitable world for all based on the principles of living well and people’s diplomacy.@@@Times of crisis require the best of us.@@@When warnings sound, action must follow.@@@Only then will development be sustainable and peace be maintained.@@@Honest reflection on the gravity of the challenges must be followed by determined commitments to address them.@@@That is what respecting the Charter of the United Nations means and what multilateralism is all about.@@@We are all aware of the immense tasks facing us.@@@Almost 350 million people in more than 80 countries face acute food insecurity, trying to merely survive the day instead of making plans for tomorrow.@@@Some 50 million people in 45 countries are on the brink of starvation.@@@Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is halting, leaving millions of women, men and children behind.@@@Extreme poverty is on the rise for the first time in two decades.@@@The world is in the midst of an accelerating climate and environmental crisis, and the effects of the ongoing pandemic continue to afflict individuals and societies around the world.@@@A permanent member of the Security Council has launched an unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression against a neighbouring country.@@@That was done in blatant disregard of its international obligations and the human suffering that extends far beyond the immediate war zone.@@@As Member States, we also know what is required of us.@@@The General Assembly has come together to demand that Russia immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@The General Assembly has reaffirmed Ukrainian sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.@@@Today Sweden reiterates that demand in the strongest possible terms, alongside other European Union (EU) member States, transatlantic partners and countries around the globe.@@@The war in Ukraine must stop, and Russia’s troops must withdraw.@@@Any fake referendums on Ukrainian territory would be illegal and will have no effect.@@@Neither partial mobilization, the appalling use of nuclear threats nor any other escalation will deter us from supporting Ukraine.@@@Humanitarian law and principles must be upheld, and Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be protected from Russia’s illegal and reckless attacks.@@@Accountability for the heinous crimes committed must be ensured.@@@International law must be upheld, and decisions by United Nations entities must be respected.@@@Russia’s aggression has severely escalated the food security, energy and financial crises.@@@Governments and societies already struggling to cope with the consequences of climate change, conflicts and the pandemic now face even more serious challenges.@@@Because of the actions of one country, more than one and a half billion people in more than half of the States Members of the United Nations find themselves at greater risk of poverty, starvation and debt.@@@In short, the global relief, recovery and resilience needs are immense.@@@Sweden and the EU have scaled up our own contributions to meet them.@@@To save lives and alleviate suffering where needs are greatest, Sweden has increased its humanitarian assistance to a record high $950 million this year.@@@We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@Under the Initiative, some 50,000 tons of wheat will, thanks partly to Swedish funding, soon leave the port of Odesa, bound for millions of women, men and children at risk of famine in Yemen.@@@A significant part of Sweden’s ambitious aid budget has been directed to the United Nations as an investment in global peace, security and development and the multilateral system itself.@@@Our actions are firmly anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace, with the SDGs, and in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which are now more important than ever.@@@It is time to raise our ambition and accelerate action to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, or we will fail not only future generations but also our own.@@@At the international meeting Stockholm+50, held in June, countries came together to follow through on recommendations and actions.@@@Sweden has spearheaded the climate transition through innovation and green investments and an ambitious increase in climate aid.@@@Mounting evidence shows that climate change also leads to greater risks to peace and stability.@@@A solid foundation for advancing climate security is in place at the United Nations and in regional organizations.@@@The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe took key decisions last year during the Swedish chairpersonship, and the EU is scaling up.@@@The nuclear threat is alarmingly present, and Russia’s actions lower the threshold in a way that increases the threat facing us all.@@@In January, the leaders of all five nuclear-weapon States committed to the prevention of nuclear war and avoiding an arms race.@@@They affirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.@@@Russia’s irresponsible actions and nuclear rhetoric since then severely undermine the credibility of its commitment to that pledge.@@@It is also deeply troubling that Russia broke consensus on the draft outcome document of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@The countries of the Stockholm Initiative on Nuclear Disarmament have presented ideas in response to the Secretary-General’s call to bring disarmament and non-proliferation back to the top of the international agenda.@@@The world is in a gender-equality recession.@@@Regrettably, we still cannot take for granted women’s rights and representation or the resources needed to ensure them.@@@Violence against women and girls has increased.@@@Access to safe and legal abortion has suffered major setbacks.@@@And one year after the Taliban takeover, the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan has turned into a nightmare, in an unparalleled system of discrimination.@@@At the same time, more and more States are acknowledging that a gender perspective is needed to meet global challenges.@@@As we gather for the first fully in-person General Assembly high-level week since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, we must do everything in our power to prevent another pandemic.@@@Sweden and the EU have made substantial contributions to global vaccination.@@@Last year alone, Sweden committed more than $600 million to global health.@@@The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response has set out clear recommendations for action, and we should make use of them.@@@A year ago, the Secretary-General presented his blueprint for a modern multilateral system.@@@Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) is an accelerator of the SDGs, a launch pad for a new agenda for peace and a way towards a more inclusive, modern and networked United Nations.@@@It was us, the Member States, who called for the report — and as Member States we should do our collective best to act on it.@@@The recent establishment of the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth was a fitting first decision, because this is an agenda for the future.@@@And the convening of the Transforming Education Summit earlier this week was another important step towards implementation.@@@We look forward to similar progress on other recommendations, from investments in peacebuilding and strategic foresight to digitalization and a global economy that benefits all by being fair and open.@@@We must keep up the momentum until we realize our ambitions at the Summit of the Future in 2024.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has caused the greatest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, aggravating the already serious global refugee situation.@@@This military invasion of a country in our neighbourhood, in violation of the very same international law that has protected us all from aggression, has also fundamentally changed Sweden’s security environment.@@@In response to the serious deterioration of the security situation, on 16 May the Swedish Government decided to apply for NATO membership.@@@The decision has broad national support and was made following extensive consultations among our political parties.@@@It was taken in tandem with Finland, and the decision is anchored in a firm belief that security is best built together with others.@@@When I signed our formal request for NATO membership, I noted the fundamental changes to our defence and security policy.@@@But I also stressed the importance of the continuity of our ambitious global and multilateral foreign policy.@@@That enduring global commitment is also reflected in the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.@@@Sweden will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first half of 2023.@@@We look forward to further strengthening the EU’s global role and deepening cooperation with partners around the world.@@@We will work to protect, promote and defend democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.@@@And we
will reinforce the already solid EU-United Nations relationship in seeking multilateral solutions.@@@We lend our full support to Denmark’s candidacy to serve as an elected member on the Security Council for the 2025- 2026 term.@@@Its campaign message — equality, security, action — is a message from all the Nordic countries.@@@People working for peace, security, development and human rights should feel safe in their jobs.@@@There have been 176 attacks on humanitarian workers so far this year, and 47 of those workers were killed.@@@More than 50 peacekeepers have lost their lives while serving in United Nations missions.@@@A few months ago, the Secretary-General@@@and I inaugurated a work of art in this very building in memory of Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp, who were murdered while working for the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@In too many countries, civil-society representatives, human rights defenders and journalists are threatened, subjected to violence or even killed for expressing their opinions or reporting on current events.@@@The global trend of democratic backsliding must be reversed, and we must break the vicious circle of a lack of democracy, disrespect for human rights and disregard of the rule of law.@@@Investing in democracy means investing in peace and sustainable development.@@@Efforts must continue to bring clarity to the circumstances of the death of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and his crew.@@@We fully support the work of the United Nations- appointed independent investigator.@@@To echo the topic of today’s debate, we are at a watershed moment.@@@We are witnessing a full-scale war in Europe.@@@Across the globe, armed conflict and repression cause suffering and halt development.@@@We are not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis.@@@Too many people are facing hunger, being forced to flee their homes, dying from curable diseases or living in fear or under oppression.@@@We, the United Nations, must make sure there is a different story to tell next year.@@@It will not be easy, but it is possible if we heed the call to meet our interlocking challenges with transformative change — and act when warnings sound.@@@Next year we will mark 50 years since the Bahamas became a fully independent sovereign nation.@@@Our accession to full membership of the United Nations in 1973 was inspired by a recognition of the interdependence of this family of nations and by the hope that dialogue and partnership can be a path to shared solutions.@@@I believe that we Bahamians are justifiably proud of what we have accomplished in our 50 years of independence.@@@We are free, democratic, entrepreneurial and resilient, and our small size has not held us back from great achievements at home and on the world stage.@@@But we are ever more aware that many of our greatest challenges emanate from or are made worse by events and conflicts outside our borders.@@@Hurricane Dorian in 2019 was a category 5 storm that nearly destroyed two of our main islands and wiped out 30 per cent of our national economic activity.@@@The impact on our economy, our infrastructure and our people is still very much present.@@@The scientific consensus is that as ocean temperatures rise, we can expect hurricanes of greater intensity to arrive with increased frequency.@@@Small island nations like mine did not create the emissions that are warming the Earth, but we are nonetheless on the front lines of climate catastrophe.@@@Hurricane Dorian in 2019 was followed by the coronavirus disease in 2020.@@@What happens in industrialized countries does not stay in industrialized countries.@@@Every year we welcome millions of visitors to the Bahamas, drawn by our country’s beauty, culture and people.@@@But for a long while visitors could not come.@@@The health crisis quickly became an economic crisis and an education crisis, too.@@@Now, as we are working to recover, a global inflation crisis stubbornly endures.@@@It is making the basics of life unaffordable for too many and creating more hardships for our people.@@@The same is true for other countries in the Caribbean Community region and around the world.@@@And of course, day in and day out, we must also defend our thousands of miles of ocean borders from trafficking in people, drugs and guns.@@@We are not waiting for others to act — we are doing what we can to be stronger and better prepared.@@@But no one country, large or small, acting alone can stop climate change, nor can we individually reduce the threat of future pandemics, end the policies and conflicts driving global inflation or tackle global criminal networks.@@@Those problems require collective action.@@@It was the second Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold, who was candid about the purpose of this Organization.@@@The United Nations was not created in order to bring us to heaven, he said, but to save us from hell.@@@The United Nations was born out of the ashes of two World Wars.@@@Today we face different threats — ones that require us to mobilize, innovate and above all, collaborate.@@@Of all the risks we face, none require more urgent action than the climate crisis.@@@The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the first conference on climate change, was held in 1992, yet despite decades of conferences and meetings featuring warnings from scientists and experts, one sixth of all the carbon emissions ever generated — some 407 billion tons — occurred between 2010 and 2020.@@@I have frequently spoken, as have so many others, about the need for action in terms of climate justice and fairness.@@@Why should small island nations like mine, which have contributed so little to the climate crisis, experience the biggest burdens and risks of climate change?@@@The argument may be straightforward, but it has not been effective.@@@For a long time, decision-makers in both the public and private sectors believed that climate action had to come at the expense of economic growth, but now many are beginning to understand that climate inaction is the most expensive option of all.@@@Taking action is not just in the interests of those of us who are particularly vulnerable.@@@It is in the interests of every country.@@@That enlightened self-interest that should motivate action.@@@The good news is that there are also positive incentives.@@@Transitioning to clean energy is going to create jobs, increase efficiencies and improve living standards.@@@Again, I want to emphasize that other countries should not do it for us, but for themselves.@@@I do not believe in despair.@@@I believe in determination and human ingenuity.@@@We can do this.@@@Countries that disagree on many other issues, including important ones, must cooperate on this issue in their own self-interest.@@@We have roughly 40 days until the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is held in Egypt.@@@Let this year be the year that we turn talk into action.@@@Let us roll up our sleeves and get to work.@@@Let those who pledge write the cheque.@@@Countries like mine, already trapped by billions in climate debt, need funding to transition to renewable energy infrastructure.@@@We have begun to install solar microgrids across our islands, but scaling up will require a lot of additional funding.@@@We in the Bahamas are playing our part.@@@In February and July of this year, we hosted the One Young World regional and annual conferences for young people to support the next generation in their efforts to engage with climate-related issues.@@@This was the first climate conference for young people in the region.@@@We recognize the importance and value of the participation of young people.@@@The Bahamas supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the provisions on youth engagement in the Secretary- General’s report entitled “Our Common Agenda” (A/75/982).@@@Then in August, the Bahamas took the lead in bringing together the member countries of the Caribbean to agree a consensus position for negotiations at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We are actively defining ways to protect and safeguard our shallow seas, mangroves and seagrasses.@@@All of it acts as a major carbon sink for the world.@@@We urgently need to build capacity.@@@We are now inviting those with potential technological solutions to bring their innovations to the Bahamas.@@@It is time for a new resolve and new cooperation.@@@Last year, I brought the threat to the financial-services industry in the Bahamas and our region to the attention of the General Assembly (see A/76/PV.14).@@@I said then that financial services are a crucial component of the Bahamian economy.@@@We see an indispensable role for the United Nations in leveraging its universal jurisdiction for greater oversight of global anti-money-laundering, de-risking and tax-cooperation matters.@@@Sadly, little to nothing has changed.@@@We continue to struggle to recover from the economic shocks of hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@We also have the additional battle brought by inflationary pressures created not by us, but by the war in Europe.@@@And now, to top it off, we are yet again the victims of inequitable and unjust measures on the part of major economic actors.@@@All those factors place a stranglehold on our national development and that of other small island developing States.@@@Just yesterday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued a statement placing the Bahamas on its blacklist.@@@That action is profoundly unfair.@@@When we look at the countries that are flagged as high risk and blacklisted, several startling commonalities emerge.@@@Why is it that European States that operate frameworks akin to those of blacklisted countries are not even eligible for inclusion on these lists?@@@Why are all the countries targeted — all of them — small and vulnerable, and former colonies of European States?@@@We find it astounding that the $2 trillion to $3 trillion, which is estimated to be laundered each year through the developed countries, are never flagged as causes for concern.@@@And yet my country, which is widely recognized as one of the best regulated countries in the world, and other countries such as the Bahamas, are singled out for such reputational attacks.@@@The robust regulatory regimes of our Central Bank, Securities Commission and Insurance Commission are chastised on minor details of technical process, while much bigger transgressions in the developed world are ignored.@@@The evidence is mounting that the considerations behind these decisions have less to do with compliance and more to do with the darker issues of prejudged discriminatory perceptions.@@@Let me submit that Black-governed countries also matter.@@@We support the call for reforms in the global financial system to make it more relevant to the needs of today.@@@But those reforms need ambition.@@@They need to go beyond the incremental, and they need to apply to all.@@@For example, the community of international financial institutions is in a position to forgive the debt incurred by the economic shutdowns that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they should do so.@@@Every year that we do not do the right thing, the right thing to do becomes more expensive.@@@When my neighbours are in crisis, whether the cause is climate or crime or instability, the Bahamas is affected by the humanitarian and security needs that arise.@@@We repeat once again our opposition to the decades-long embargo and sanctions against Cuba.@@@COVID-19 has exacerbated the situation for the people of Cuba and made existing hardship and deprivation much worse.@@@The people of Haiti continue to suffer.@@@The political vacuum left after the assassination of the country’s president just over a year ago has led to more
violence, with the instability fuelling more tragedy and threatening the entire region.@@@Migration is not the only issue with which the Bahamas is grappling.@@@We are also struggling with the proliferation of guns.@@@We do not manufacture guns in our country, and yet they find their way illegally to the Bahamas and within days can be connected to some criminal activity.@@@In an archipelagic nation made up of some 700 islands and cays spread across 100,000 square miles of water, defending our borders is an expensive challenge.@@@We believe more manageable and effective efforts can be made at the source to ensure that a right to bear arms does not so quickly and easily translate into our right to traffic arms.@@@We in the Bahamas believe there is still real purpose in the mission of the United Nations.@@@We will continue to support multilateral efforts aimed at tackling the shared challenges of our time.@@@We congratulate Secretary-@@@General Guterres for his leadership in achieving agreement with Ukraine, Russia and Turkey to get the flow of trade in the Black Sea moving once again.@@@The stabilization in world food markets has served millions of people in the developing world.@@@We see the involvement and participation of women and young people as inherent and central to our process.@@@My Government considers it vital that women play fully active roles in planning and decision-making, both in national and multilateral affairs.@@@We also support the addition of a United Nations Youth Office.@@@The needs and rights of small island developing States cannot be sustained by making policy advances only in times of global shock.@@@We are grateful that the Alliance of Small Island States seized the moment in 2020 to secure the cause of work on the multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@We consider this a critical step forward in ensuring greater equity for countries such as the Bahamas.@@@We are aware that the global community is grossly underprepared in securing protections for the global commons, including water, biodiversity and the digital landscape.@@@In moving forward on this agenda, we also recognize that a more robust and better change-making architecture is needed across the United Nations.@@@In this respect, we hope that members will support the candidature of Bahamian citizen Stephen Bereaux for the post of Director of the Telecommunication Development Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union for the 2023-2026 term.@@@By each of us acting out of our own enlightened self-interest, we acknowledge that we ourselves benefit from doing what is in the best interest of all in meeting the existential challenge posed by the climate crisis.@@@It should be an increasingly self-evident truth that none of us can be safe until we are all safe.@@@Good morning to one and all.@@@First, I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@I also commend his predecessor, Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives.@@@In a challenging year, I am here to condemn not one but three great global conflicts.@@@The first is Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine — a scourge that reflects a brutal mentality of conquest and empire.@@@No matter their might or size, Fiji is unafraid to condemn any warring nation.@@@We owe nothing less to the Fijian
peacekeepers who have sacrificed and paid the ultimate price for the sake of peace around the world.@@@We in the Pacific, who have lived the horror of nuclear fallout, wholly denounce Mr. Putin’s threatened use of nuclear weapons.@@@And I appeal to him — give diplomacy a chance to bring this war to a speedy close.@@@We also condemn another war — the climate war — that humankind is waging on itself, its ecosystems and its oceans.@@@This war is not fought with bullets and bombs, but apathy, denial and the lack of courage to do what we all know must be done.@@@This is a war we are losing in every community, city and country of every size.@@@But small States, those least responsible, stand to lose the most of all.@@@Yet we are not being heard — not even, it seems, by the leadership of multilateral development banks.@@@Lastly, I condemn the cold war of indifference against the citizens of small islands and States who bear the brunt of this superstorm of global shocks — from rising commodity prices to the climate crisis and the pandemic.@@@Surely, as leaders, we have the capacity to defend peace on all those fronts.@@@I ask — where is the world’s courage to do so?@@@I see that courage in the Fijian people I serve as we build up our country, undaunted by those challenges.@@@Today I will share their story — not for the sake of pride, but because leaders should know the lives, progress and aspirations they threaten through their inaction.@@@I arrived this week from the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a leader who holds a special place in Fijian history and in the hearts of the Fijian people, as well as in my heart.@@@My fondest memory of Her Majesty is from London, four years ago, at a welcome reception she hosted at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.@@@She walked over to me from her greeting post to say that she had asked the then- Prince Charles to look after their other guests so that she could personally welcome me and Fiji back into the Commonwealth.@@@It was a simple gesture, but a special affirmation of all that we had worked to achieve for Fiji’s new and true democracy.@@@For we had done away with an undemocratic system that relegated hundreds of thousands of Fijians to the margins of society by design.@@@We had adopted a new Constitution that echoed the spirit of the promise of the Charter of the United Nations to uphold equal rights for all peoples regardless of background, religion, ethnicity, gender, age or physical ability or provenance.@@@It guaranteed common and equal Fijian identity and citizenship for all citizens.@@@The strong and accountable institutions it established and the protections it upholds produced an electoral system in which every Fijian vote holds equal value.@@@And the Fijian people have used that vote to elect my Government twice in the past eight years.@@@In our service, we have worked to advance the civil, political and socioeconomic constitutional rights of every Fijian — from the protection of indigenous land ownership to the right to clean water and adequate sanitation, the right to a clean and healthy environment and the right to education, among many more.@@@Since 2014, we have built or replaced hundreds of kilometres of water pipelines and improved access to clean water to over 80 per cent of all Fijians.@@@Thousands of Fijian households have gained access to electric power for the first time — propelling electricity access in the country to upwards of 96 per cent.@@@We have replaced or outright built dozens of bridges and crossings and lit up the country with thousands of new streetlights.@@@We have built, upgraded or rehabilitated close to 1,000 kilometres of roads.@@@Poverty is falling, incomes are rising.@@@The cost of data has fallen by as much as 98 per cent.@@@Ninety-five per cent of the Fijian population have mobile phone connectivity.@@@And a national digital television platform, Walesi, reaches all 110 populated islands in Fiji.@@@We achieved the longest stretch of economic growth in Fijian history.@@@Among those wins for sustainable development, the Fijian education revolution is my greatest pride as Prime Minister.@@@For the first time in our history, primary and secondary education are free — not free in name, but free in fact and accessible to all.@@@Textbooks are free.@@@Whether they travel by road, river or ocean, disadvantaged students’ transportation to schools is subsidized.@@@We have extended opportunities for tertiary education beyond what was ever thought imaginable.@@@And today Fijian women outnumber men in our universities.@@@In times of crisis, our constitutional commitments to every Fijian have served us best and mattered most.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic contracted our economy by over 20 per cent.@@@It stole half of our Government revenues, flung over 100,000 Fijians out of full-time employment and pushed us to the precipice of a socioeconomic crisis.@@@Through decisive policy choices, we maintained the strongest possible focus on protecting people and communities.@@@Although our tourism revenue was zero, we paid out income support to the unemployed.@@@We did not slash a cent
of our pensions and payments to elderly and disabled Fijians.@@@In total, we paid out half a billion dollars in social assistance — the equivalent of 10 per cent of the value of our gross domestic product.@@@With our partners’ support, we achieved near-universal vaccination of our adult population.@@@We reopened Fiji’s borders from this past December, and we have since welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors and earned hundreds of millions in revenue.@@@More of our people are working again, and we are set towards record-breaking double-digit economic growth for the Fijian economy this year.@@@The pace of our recovery is possible because we prepared for it.@@@We kept our national airline, Fiji Airways, ready to resume full operations throughout the COVID-19 crisis.@@@We supported our tourism industry to weather the storm.@@@That allowed us to set the terms of our reopening.@@@With our steady recovery, we are now paying out tens of millions of dollars to help the most vulnerable Fijian families to meet the global rising cost of food, fuel and other essentials.@@@Our eight-year-old democracy has delivered the equality that our people cherish.@@@It has delivered the services and infrastructure on which they depend.@@@It has certainly also shown its resilience.@@@Our eyes are now on the next eight years — the sprint from now until 2030, which will be the most defining period ever for our people’s and planet’s future.@@@If we do not halve carbon emissions by that critical year, the crisis of our warming planet will imperil every gain that we and every nation have made.@@@If we fail to secure 1.5°C, we will crush any hope of improving our citizens’ quality of life.@@@We were given glimpses of that doomsday proposition worldwide in the floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, dying coral and melting glaciers.@@@We in Fiji felt that devastation in the 14 cyclones that have struck us since 2014.@@@Those storms stole lives.@@@They levelled homes.@@@They destroyed schools.@@@They traumatized our young people.@@@The Pacific’s children are among the least to blame for the climate crisis, yet our children are the most affected.@@@I challenge leaders from the high-emitting nations to name a greater global injustice than the price that young Pacific islanders are paying for climate change.@@@Since 2014, Fiji has rebuilt or repaired more than 200 schools devasted by cyclones.@@@We built cement and nature-based seawalls to keep out the rising seas.@@@We stabilized vast stretches of riverbank.@@@Where seawalls cannot suffice, we have already relocated six communities, with over 40 more in the queue to be moved.@@@We are building back better to the standards demanded by a warmer world.@@@We are borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to do that.@@@The archaic architecture of multilateral development banks and global financial services gives us little to no access to grants or concessional climate financing, particularly for adaptation.@@@We are therefore left with little to no choice.@@@We legislated a net-zero commitment by 2050 through the Climate Change Act 2021, which will make us more energy secure, protect us from energy price shocks beyond our control and provide us with cleaner air, better health and better jobs.@@@Yet, despite the clear benefits, the imperative before us and all the talk that we hear of saving the planet, the world’s collective commitments remain trifling.@@@They simply will not keep us at well below the 2°C target, let alone 1.5°C.@@@I again urge developed nations to deliver on the $100 billion climate financing commitment at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt this year.@@@That is now three years overdue.@@@Ahead of Glasgow, I told leaders not to bother packing their bags if they did not come with serious carbon-slashing commitments.@@@I have a new ask before they arrive in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@They should come only if they plan to arrive true to their climate financing commitments.@@@They should come to Sharm El-Sheikh only if they are ready to agree to a loss-and-damage mechanism, in addition to a post-2025 financing framework.@@@That must be in the order of $750 billion, with at least 10 per cent of climate financing destined for small island States.@@@That is our story	a Fijian story in every sense.@@@It is the story of David against Goliath — a small State facing nations, corporations and interests far bigger than we are.@@@On behalf of every family that is watching us from home and praying for our success, we are unrelenting in this fight for its future.@@@We are determined to provide it with opportunities to do well for itself and its families.@@@We are determined to create new jobs in nature, in technology, in sustainable tourism and in our blue and green economies.@@@Today we ask the world to join us.@@@This is not the time for war.@@@This is not the time for words.@@@This is a
time for will and a time for courage.@@@Fiji is ready to make the coming years count for our people and for the planet.@@@Our question is this: Are Member States with us?@@@They should not say yes unless they plan to show it.@@@I bring the warm greetings of His Majesty the King and from the people of Bhutan.@@@Allow me to convey our congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@He may rest assured of Bhutan’s full support as he steers us through the session.@@@I also take this opportunity to convey our gratitude and admiration to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for the exceptional manner in which he guided our work this past tumultuous year.@@@Our appreciation is also due to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who, in a most challenging year for our Organization, coinciding with the first year of his second term, has continued to serve as a compelling and valiant advocate for peace, people and planet.@@@I arrived in New York last week with a vastly different prepared text for delivery today.@@@In recent days, however, I received a heartfelt appeal from Chimi, a bright seven-year-old girl in class two at Lunana Primary School, in Bhutan, which has compelled me to rethink my statement.@@@Lunana is a place in one of our northernmost districts, remote and perched at an altitude of 3,400 metres.@@@It is home to a community of 810 people, comprising 185 households of highland nomadic herders, spread across 13 scattered villages.@@@Today Lunana is embraced in the astounding beauty of the rugged snow-capped peaks of the mighty Himalayas, which Lunaps, or the people of Lunana, both revere and depend upon for their livelihood and sustenance.@@@Each time that Chimi and members of her community glance at these majestic peaks, the foremost question on their mind is: How long before they become barren and brown?@@@I would like to share young Chimi’s letter with the Assembly today: It reads:
“My village is in great danger because of global warming.@@@The glaciers and snow on our mountains are melting, the glacial lakes above our village are getting bigger every day.@@@“I am sure it may cause a big flood in our village at any time.@@@And we have to be in constant fear every day and night.@@@“Our innocent people are suffering because of others’ evil actions.@@@In the near future, we may not see glaciers and snow on the mountains, beautiful glacial lakes or Lunaps in this place.@@@“Therefore, I would request Your Excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from global warming.@@@“I am sure that if we all come together, we can not only save our tiny village but also make our Earth safe for all living beings.@@@“I think we are not too late to fight against global warming now.”@@@Chimi’s poignant letter evokes the plain truths of communities standing on the front lines of the climate crisis.@@@But this is not limited to Bhutan.@@@We are reminded with far too much frequency that across the world today, lives and livelihoods are in peril due to the impacts of human-induced climate change, rising sea levels and natural disasters.@@@The negative impacts of climate change are disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable and marginalized communities around the world, and doing so at a faster pace.@@@The future of our youth and successive generations is under immediate threat, and the great irony is that it is through no fault of their own.@@@But it is not too late.@@@There is still time to undertake course correction, but that window of opportunity is fast closing.@@@This calls for a demonstration of greater ambition from developed and large emitters, consistent with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@We must see deeper emission reductions in keeping with a fair share of global efforts, consistent with the 1.5°C pathway.@@@At the same time, we must see greater solidarity and cooperation from all States to support the efforts of the most vulnerable to adapt to the changing climate and deal with its consequences.@@@We must ensure adequate and predictable finance and technological and capacity support for developing countries, particularly the landlocked developing countries, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small island developing States, to enable us to achieve the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.@@@We need to forge strong international cooperation in coming up with viable projects and partnerships to scale up investments in alternative renewable energy and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in the manufacturing and transport sectors.@@@Bhutan hopes that the urgency to move beyond business as usual will be heeded at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in November.@@@In Bhutan, our visionary Monarchs have long recognized the importance of conserving our natural environment and living in harmony with nature.@@@Although small, we have made bold commitments to safeguarding nature and protecting our environment, most significant of which is the constitutional requirement of maintaining 60 per cent of our total area under forest cover, whereas in reality more than 70 per cent of our territory is forested.@@@Our forests are net carbon sinks, absorbing two-thirds more carbon than we emit.@@@Bhutan is not just carbon neutral, but carbon negative.@@@In a world heading towards a water, food and energy crisis, investing in sustainable mountain development should be a global priority.@@@We need to build the resilience of our communities and offer mountain communities practical and sustainable alternatives to enable them to continue living in harmony with nature and their surroundings.@@@We must continue to foster sustainable mountain development, with special emphasis on mountain agriculture, sustainable mountain tourism and opportunities to tap the renewable energy that the mountains provide.@@@The proclamation last year of 2022 as the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development put the spotlight on sustainable mountain development, its conservation and sustainable use as integral means of protecting the common heritage of our planet.@@@To maintain focus and raise awareness, we are organizing an annual ultra-marathon event, known as the Snowman Race, that will invite elite athletes from around the world to run across the Himalayas at elevations of 5,000 metres above sea level.@@@We hope that this will generate more action and enhance greater partnerships.@@@We are at a watershed moment in history.@@@The world today faces an unprecedented series of interlinked and cascading crises.@@@The human race continues on a collision course with nature, battling against the climate, biodiversity and pollution.@@@At the same time, the pandemic that surfaced in March 2020 is still with us, and rather than abate, continues to morph and reinvent itself in new and more virulent strains.@@@Outbreaks of other viral infections continue to occur at alarmingly frequent intervals, threatening the world with another possible pandemic.@@@It is certain that these biological threats will continue and that we need to be better prepared.@@@Like many other parts of the world, Bhutan was not spared the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or its induced disruptions.@@@We are fortunate that with our beloved Monarch leading from the front, with Government policies and measures firmly grounded in science, and most importantly of all, with the full solidarity and confidence of our people behind us, Bhutan was fortunate to fare better than many others.@@@As a result of stringent measures, determination, and grit, we were able to minimize the immediate public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging with minimum loss of life.@@@Our campaign to vaccinate our population has been recognized as an unlikely
success story, and today more than 90 per cent of our entire population stand fully vaccinated.@@@This was made possible due in no small measure by the heartwarming goodwill of friends and partners, including India, whose Vaccine Maitri initiative enabled the full first round of vaccinations for our adult population.@@@We are also grateful to the United States, Denmark, Bulgaria, Croatia and China, whose generosity with vaccines came at a most critical time.@@@We also thank all the other bilateral partners and multilateral agencies that supported logistics and provided financial support, medicines and equipment for our response to the pandemic.@@@Our success would not have been possible without all of their support.@@@We remain ever grateful.@@@Just when we are embarking on rebuilding and recovering from the pandemic and its associated impacts, conflict, supply disruptions, a surge in food, energy and fertilizer crises are driving millions more into extreme poverty, magnifying hunger and malnutrition.@@@Predictably, it is the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us that suffer the brunt.@@@The Secretary-General has rightly described this as either a breakdown or breakthrough moment for humankind and for the planet.@@@Transformation is what we called for in declaration on the on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1).@@@We thank the Secretary-General for his groundbreaking report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), responding to this call.@@@Bhutan has followed closely the discussions around the report and its recommendations, and we are pleased with the momentum that has been generated.@@@As we continue our deliberations, Bhutan will engage constructively, including in preparations for the Summit of the Future, and work towards elaboration of a global digital compact.@@@Our Common Agenda must provide the road map to turbocharge and accelerate our actions towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Bhutan welcomes the report’s recognition of the need to look beyond the gross domestic product (GDP).@@@That finds strong resonance with Bhutan’s own approach to balanced and human-centred development, which we call Gross National Happiness.@@@It is now widely accepted that this cannot be achieved by tracking GDP alone.@@@Bhutan has always believed that the pursuit of development and progress must respond to a higher calling.@@@We need measures that take into account the full spectrum of human development, as well as the multifaceted factors that provide the enabling environment within which individuals can pursue and achieve that common yet elusive human aspiration to happiness and well-being.@@@This discussion assumes greater urgency as we approach the midpoint towards implementing the 2030 Agenda, in full realization that today, the conflict in Europe and the looming climate emergency have thrown efforts towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and SDGs off course.@@@We need to refocus our priorities by shifting gears and turning our commitments into action, and doing so by working together in the spirit of genuine solidarity.@@@Bhutan welcomed the convening of the Transforming Education Summit on 19 September.@@@His Majesty the King has always accorded the highest importance to the education sector, recognizing that a nation’s fate begins in its classrooms and schools.@@@Education is a critical pillar of a country’s development and holds the key to unlocking many of our shared global challenges.@@@As His Majesty The King remarked as early as 2014,
“Education is empowering — it is a social equalizer and it facilitates self-discovery, which leads to realizing one’s full potential.@@@Good education gives you confidence, good judgment, virtuous disposition and the tools to achieve happiness successfully.@@@A good school gives a child a fair shot at success and ensures that a person’s achievement in life will not be predetermined by his or her race, parentage and social connections.”@@@Bhutan may have been one of the most recent countries to finally reopen its borders since the emergence of the pandemic.@@@As difficult and painful as these past two and half years have been, they have allowed for deep reflection at the national level and permitted time for an honest assessment of gaps and challenges.@@@Weaknesses were bared and, in some instances, fault lines deepened.@@@We came to the harsh realization that drastic recalibration of our systems were needed if Bhutan is to position itself as a country that is prosperous, resilient and future-ready.@@@With one year remaining before our exit date from the LDC category, those measures will buttress our efforts to ensure that Bhutan’s graduation is smooth, sustainable and irreversible.@@@As I speak, major transformational initiatives are underway in Bhutan to strengthen public service delivery.@@@The entire public sector will be streamlined, strengthened in terms of capacity and performance, and held to more rigorous standards of professionalism and accountability.@@@Our public servants must serve the citizens with the better and faster public services that they deserve.@@@While universal health care is a guarantee enshrined in our Constitution, reforms in the health sector focus on the importance of preparedness for future outbreaks and pandemics, strengthening the quality of health care, leveraging technology, and a renewed focus on mental health.@@@The health sector is being reformed to provide not only primary, but secondary and tertiary health care to all people within half a day’s travel.@@@Specialist services are expanding across the country including, sending mobile teams to screen and treat high-burden diseases.@@@Bhutan’s revamped tourism policy was launched with much anticipation on 23 September, coinciding with the opening of our international border.@@@Since 1974, when Bhutan opened its doors for tourism, we have always followed the policy of high value-low volume tourism, as envisioned by His Majesty the fourth King of Bhutan.@@@However the minimum daily tariffs that were instituted were found to be too low, resulting in our becoming a budget destination, leading to mass tourism and its associated problems of increasing waste, a decreasing quality of service standards, the underemployment of our youth engaged in the sector, never-before-seen traffic jams and overcrowding of our most religious sites.@@@We have always prioritized the well-being of the people, preserving our environment, tradition and culture over unsustainable and mindless development.@@@Therefore, in keeping with our development philosophy of Gross National Happiness, the sector has been restructured and reformed so that it benefits Bhutan not only economically, but socially and environmentally as well.@@@In the long run, we want to create high-value, authentic and unique experiences for visitors and well-paying professional jobs and businesses for our citizens.@@@The increasing fragmentation, polarization and growing inequality we witness in the world today only serve as an urgent cry for strengthening multilateralism, greater political resolve, solidarity and compassion.@@@It is apparent that no individual, community or country can overcome contemporary challenges on their own.@@@Interdependence is at the core of our existence, and we must come together through stronger, more effective multilateralism.@@@Bhutan’s commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, remains unwavering.@@@As a small, landlocked and peaceful country, we remain fully committed to the noble objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Coinciding with the fiftieth year of our membership in the Organization, which we marked last year, Bhutan responded to the call to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security — a key pillar and objective of the United Nations.@@@Since then, Bhutan has prepared for the deployment of its first uniformed military unit, a light quick reaction force, to a United Nations peace mission.@@@This process was set in motion in 2014, when we first joined the ranks of United Nations troop-contributing countries.@@@Our well-trained troops will arrive to serve the cause of peace in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic in the weeks ahead.@@@I am confident that they will serve the international community with distinction and honour.@@@It is a matter of great pride that, although Bhutan is amongst the smallest Members of the United Nations, with this initial deployment we will rise into the ranks of the top 60 troop-contributing countries, from our current position at 81.@@@Of particular note, and consistent with Bhutan’s deep commitment to the promotion and protection of the environment, Bhutan considers the pursuit of environmentally responsible practices in operations to be a moral imperative.@@@We feel strongly that at the minimum, the do-no-harm ethic must drive all aspects of field operations and conduct, and that wherever possible, field presences should, on their departure, be remembered by local communities for the positive legacies they have left for host countries.@@@Bhutan has therefore pledged that when Bhutan’s uniformed contingent deploys, we will do so in an environmentally sustainable manner with renewable energy, waste management and the provision of assistance to the local communities that we will serve.@@@The centrepiece of our pledge is the use of solar panels for lighting purposes in barracks and the camp area.@@@We will carry out the planting trees around the company location, in accordance with the existing policies of the host country.@@@While those pledges are modest, our hope is that they will contribute to the overall environmental efforts of United Nations peacekeeping and demonstrate that such practices can be emulated and scaled.@@@Our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping is a significant milestone in the progression of Bhutan’s engagement with the Organization.@@@We are sincerely thankful to the international community for the trust and confidence reposed in our ability to meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@In its seventy-seventh year of existence, our Organization too needs a reboot to be able to meet the challenges of the present day and the future and to keep pace with and reflect contemporary realities.@@@It must be reformed to respond more effectively to changed global realities and to the new and emerging threats that confront us today.@@@Nowhere is this more evident or urgent than in the growing call for comprehensive reform of the Security Council.@@@Yet we note that, 43 years since inclusion of the subject in the General Assembly’s agenda and nearly three decades since the establishment of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council, we have fallen far short.@@@Lack of progress on Security Council reform throws into question the relevance and legitimacy of the current global architecture, fragilizes international peace and security, and impinges on the Council’s ability to deliver on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.@@@Bhutan has always maintained that reform must accommodate the interests and concerns of all Member States, particularly those unrepresented and underrepresented.@@@The expansion of the Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, along with reform of its working methods, constitute essential components of this process.@@@In our view from Asia, India and Japan must be included as permanent members of a reformed Council.@@@The current challenges facing the world today remind us of our interdependence and the imperatives of collaboration and solidarity.@@@While there have been shining examples of international cooperation, we continue to be distrustful with each other, less understanding and driven more by self-interest.@@@As the Buddha revealed 2,000 years ago, if we are to end suffering we must rid ourselves of its three root causes, also known as the three poisons: ignorance of the nature of impermanence, greed and hatred.@@@It is these that are the main causes of the global problems today.@@@The antidote and traits we can all draw inspiration from are said to be wisdom, sharing and compassion.@@@Those enduring values find consonance in the essence of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.@@@Allow me to join all speakers before me in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on his election and in wishing him well in his role.@@@I also thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session for his excellent leadership.@@@Finally, I thank Secretary-General Guterres and the Deputy Secretary-General for their ongoing leadership of our multilateral Organization.@@@We meet at a time when the United Nations family is facing its greatest tests.@@@The States Members of the United Nations have to work with the Organization to develop effective responses to the current challenges.@@@As the theme of the General Assembly indicates, those challenges are diverse, immense, yet interconnected, and no country can respond alone.@@@Some have referred to this moment as a key turning point in history.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war strongly influence those attitudes today.@@@However, for South Africa, the real inflection point will be a world attending fully to the needs of the marginalized and the forgotten.@@@Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality joblessness and a feeling of being entirely ignored and excluded.@@@Acting on the 2021 Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) vision of the Secretary-General should become the major objective of this time — because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will, in our view, be the beginnings of the real inflection point in human history.@@@The Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its human rights protocols all commit us to protecting all people without distinction of any kind.@@@We must acknowledge that we face theses crises today because we have not always upheld those foundational principles consistently and fairly.@@@We believe that international law matters when this one is affected, but does not matter when this other one is affected.@@@That does not help to uphold international law.@@@We have learned a great deal from the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@It has provided us with a road map on what
we should do as the global community and what we should not do in order to address global challenges.@@@We need to use the lessons learned from the pandemic effectively.@@@There were some noble initiatives, such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), co-chaired by President Ramaphosa of South Africa, the African Union champion for the COVID-19 response, as well as the Prime Minister of Norway.@@@The ACT-A initiative laid the basis for a fairer distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.@@@We would like today to thank all of the countries that have acted on their financial commitment to the ACT-A initiative.@@@Global solidarity is also required if we are to meet other pressing challenges, such as energy and food insecurity, climate change and the devastation caused by conflicts, including the existential threat of nuclear weapons.@@@Up to now, instead of working collectively to address those challenges, we have grown further apart as geopolitical tensions and mistrust permeate our relations.@@@We should, however, move forward in solidarity, united in efforts to address our common global challenges to ensure sustainable peace and development.@@@One of the tasks we must successfully implement in order to ensure developing countries are not left behind when treatments are available is to create and support research and innovation capacity in Africa and other parts of the world for vaccine production, to invest in strengthened public-health systems and to produce thousands more qualified professional health workers.@@@All of that requires sustainable investment in higher education research institutions and in global research cooperation.@@@The mobilization of resources and capabilities to strengthen the pandemic response and the preparedness of all nations must be substantially increased.@@@It would be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19.@@@We need to strengthen the global health architecture in order to ensure that we are better able to meet the challenges of new pandemics and other infectious diseases of concern.@@@South Africa is proud to be part of the solution to those problems through the recent establishment of the first mRNA global-technology transfer hubs, which will contribute to the security of supply of life-saving medication for African countries and other developing countries.@@@South Africa, like many other developing countries, faces huge development challenges, including in our energy sector.@@@We need to collectively address global energy shortages, including by deploying innovative solutions that are cheaper, cleaner and more accessible.@@@Working with international partners, South Africa is developing its Just Energy Transition Plan in order to significantly reduce harmful emissions in our country.@@@We are working on an expanded green economy intervention that is gaining significant momentum in our country.@@@I would like to commend the Secretary-General for focusing attention during this session of the General Assembly on transforming education.@@@Education remains one of the most important drivers to end poverty and inequality, and we will work towards increasing access to education that is affordable as a country and as a continent.@@@South Africa has no-fee schools at primary and secondary levels to allow the most vulnerable learners to access compulsory education.@@@We also have a State bursary scheme for poor students who qualify for tertiary education.@@@Over the years those measures have served to increase the enrolment of learners previously unable to access education.@@@In the field of research and innovation, we believe we need more partnerships such as the Square Kilometre Array science infrastructure project hosted in South Africa and Australia, an international partnership that is one of the largest joint scientific endeavours in history.@@@Partnerships of that nature must be encouraged in order to leverage scientific breakthroughs for development purposes.@@@We also believe that the multilateral trading system must be strengthened so that we can create an environment that is genuinely conducive to fair trade and provides opportunities for developing economies.@@@If actionable steps such as those are not taken, developing countries will remain subject to an unbalanced global financial and trading system.@@@Let us use this moment of renewal to reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as the only means for building a better world.@@@The United Nations itself must of course be transformed so that it fulfils its role in a way that is cognizant of current global dynamics.@@@It is unacceptable that 77 years after the establishment of the United Nations, five nations wield disproportionate decision-making power in the system as a whole.@@@Its transformation must include more representative, transparent and accountable organs of
global governance.@@@In order for our Organization to be effective, the General Assembly must be revitalized and the Security Council reformed.@@@Nor will we have a credible Organization if it cannot hold persistent transgressors of the Charter accountable.@@@We believe we must act immediately to protect the environment and the world we live in, for ourselves and future generations.@@@While Africa is the region least responsible for the climate crisis, it finds itself at the epicentre of its worst impacts.@@@We should therefore emerge from the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), in Egypt, with an agreement that contains enhanced and balanced actions on adaptation, mitigation and financing.@@@It must of course take into account our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.@@@In addition, we must agree at COP 27 on a mechanism for loss and change.@@@In South Africa, our Cabinet has approved wide-ranging policies to ensure that we can meet our newly determined climate-change targets.@@@We have established a climate finance task team to lead and coordinate negotiations with international partner groups in order to give effect to the Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to address South Africa’s investment needs in infrastructure with the aim of facilitating our phase-down of coal so as to ensure that no one is left behind.@@@I do not need to reiterate that building a better world requires peace and stability.@@@South Africa continues to believe that conflict resolution should not come through fuelling conflicts but through investing in efforts aimed at political dialogue.@@@We should aspire to peace as a global public good.@@@There have been no winners of the wars of the past seven decades.@@@Instead, they have engendered strife, distrust among nations, divisions — as we are seeing this week — a perpetual misallocation of resources to weapons, and increased poverty and underdevelopment.@@@Those are all features and effects of war.@@@While we work to address contemporary clashes, we should not ignore long-standing conflicts such as that of the people of Palestine, which has been on the United Nations agenda throughout the seven decades of the Organization’s existence.@@@We cannot ignore the words of Daniel Levy, the former Israeli negotiator at the Oslo talks, who addressed the Security Council recently (see S/PV.9116) and referred to the increasingly weighty body of scholarly, legal and public opinion that considers Israel to be perpetrating apartheid in the territories under its control.@@@Israel must be held accountable for its destructive actions, which have significantly impaired the possibility of a two-State solution.@@@Similarly, we cannot ignore the decades-long struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.@@@We must treat all conflicts across the globe with equal indignation, no matter the colour or creed of the people affected.@@@South Africa also calls for an end to the embargo on Cuba, which continues to impede the right to development of its people.@@@In the same vein, we call for an end to unilateral coercive measures against Zimbabwe, which have compounded the problems experienced by its people and have a detrimental effect on the broader Southern African region.@@@Our quest to build a better world will remain unfulfilled as long as people are still discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language.@@@We have a responsibility to make sure that every girl child receives an education and that every woman has an opportunity to work, study or start a business and has choice and control over her life and body.@@@We must also ensure that more women speak at the General Assembly.@@@We need to end the violence perpetrated against the most vulnerable, most often women and children.@@@We have witnessed that women in conflict situations are particularly vulnerable, including women journalists.@@@The murder of Shireen Abu Akleh and others is a stark reminder of the danger that women in conflict situations face.@@@We must do all we can to protect them and make every effort to hold those who harm them accountable.@@@We must also strengthen the capacity of the African continent’s young people and draw on their voices.@@@In that regard, we need to harness the demographic dividend by maximizing our investment in quality education as a means for addressing intergenerational poverty and ensuring inclusive economies.@@@Africa is home to more than 1.3 billion people.@@@It is fast emerging from centuries of colonialism, occupation and exploitation, as well as willful neglect and underdevelopment.@@@We now have an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, and the countries of Africa are laying a firm foundation for a new era of trade, commerce and productivity.@@@Our countries are establishing the conditions for the seamless flow of goods and services between African markets, as well as the growth of industry and the construction of the
roads, bridges, railway lines, ports and power stations that will support growth.@@@As we continue our efforts to end war, conflict and insurgency in several parts of our continent and prevent unconstitutional seizures of power, we will continue to seek greater alignment between our agenda and that of the United Nations and our own body, the African Union.@@@To overcome all those acutely global challenges, we must agree to a common path out of an increasingly polarized world.@@@A rules-based international system, predicated on international law and strict adherence to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, is essential.@@@Such a system should safeguard the interests of all, not only powerful countries.@@@We acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary- General through his vision in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which we strongly support.@@@We believe that he has provided us with options to put aside our differences, build trust and forge a world where future generations will prosper and thrive.@@@That, and not a mandate of division and conflict, should be the mandate that we adopt.@@@It is an honour to represent His Excellency Mr. Lionel Rouwen Aingimea and deliver this statement for the Republic of Nauru at the seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.@@@On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Nauru, allow me to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly for the seventy-seventh session.@@@Let me assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation and support as he leads this body in seeking transformative solutions to our shared interlocking challenges.@@@Allow me to also thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives for his exceptional stewardship of this body during the seventy-sixth session, and to note the many successful initiatives undertaken during his tenure, including the “presidency of hope” fellowship.@@@Nauru was privileged to have one of its young officials participate in this pioneering fellowship.@@@We come together at a critical moment created by three interconnected crises: the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its consequences, the war in Ukraine and a tipping point in climate change.@@@These crises are creating unprecedented humanitarian challenges and growing concerns about the global economy.@@@To overcome these challenges, and to fulfil the promises of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must draw upon the strength of multilateralism and the ability of this Organization to bring about the transformative change that builds our people’s resilience to face the crises of today and of the future.@@@This time last year, Nauru was proud to declare its COVID-19-free status.@@@Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.@@@Thankfully, however, with the strong support of our partners, Nauru was able to achieve high vaccination rates for both adults and children.@@@Our high vaccination rates have been critical in ensuring minimal casualties from COVID-19 infections.@@@We thank our partners Australia, India, Japan, Switzerland and the United States, including the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, for their support throughout the pandemic.@@@We would also like to acknowledge in particular the support and good practices demonstrated by the people of Taiwan in the face of COVID-19.@@@The Republic of China (Taiwan) is an important partner in the global response to the pandemic, as well as a particular partner of Nauru.@@@Taiwan’s exemplary response and assistance should not be ignored.@@@Taiwan is ready to share their experience, and we call for their recognition to ensure their right to engage with us all in this global forum.@@@With the help of our partners and friends, the health effects of COVID-19 on our country have been relatively mild.@@@Despite that achievement, we note with deep concern the growing global resistance to vaccinations, alongside a rise in misinformation and fear-mongering through social media and mainstream media platforms.@@@Vaccine resistance and misinformation puts us all at risk, not only for COVID-19, but for other diseases, as evidenced through the global outbreaks of measles and polio.@@@In our interconnected world, we know that no one, and no country, is safe until everyone is safe.@@@We need practical and collaborative solutions to combat the dangerous trend of misinformation for the sake of global health.@@@As we have seen too many times in Nauru, in our deeply connected world, an outbreak in one corner can produce a ripple of destruction that can touch us all.@@@To build our resilience domestically, Nauru prioritizes a preventative strategy for public health.@@@Our strategy is informed by the lessons learned during this pandemic, and we continue to seek support to review, overhaul and revamp our health systems and to thereby develop innovative solutions to our needs.@@@Moreover, to address the challenges of today and tomorrow, our health system needs to be climate resilient, with the capacity for viral risk management through e-medicine, digital technology and more.@@@Meeting our ambition will require partners to provide support and technical expertise.@@@Beyond communicable diseases, other health challenges plague small island developing States, thus undermining our chances of a sustainable and healthy future where no one is left behind.@@@The battle against non-communicable diseases is one battle we have low odds of winning owing to ongoing challenges with food security and nutrition, as well as weak policies, strategies and capacities to adequately address substance use and abuse.@@@There must be a wholesale transformation of the food system to eradicate food insecurity and malnutrition.@@@Incremental measures such as trainings, workshops and kitchen gardens alone cannot meet the needs.@@@We call on the United Nations and our partners to focus their efforts and help us towards securing affordable nutritious food for all.@@@We also take this opportunity to thank the Government of Cuba for their long-standing commitment to strengthening our health sector through the work of their medical brigades.@@@Despite the assistance they provide to many, the Cuban people continue to suffer from the economic, commercial and financial embargo of the United States.@@@We call on the United States to not forget the friendly people of Cuba, who are also struggling like us under this pandemic.@@@Education holds the key to unlocking the transformative solutions we so urgently need to address the interlocking challenges of today’s world.@@@Education holds the mould for shaping the future we want and need.@@@We must leave this week and the Transforming Education Summit not only inspired and energized by the passion of young people, but with concrete ideas and partnerships to take home and implement.@@@Quality education for all will require both creativity and urgent action, to tackle immediate needs and build towards long-term transformation.@@@We have the opportunity now to reimagine education and invest in new approaches.@@@We join calls for global efforts to review and revamp our education delivery models, with a view to improving teacher attraction and retention strategies, strengthening partnerships between the home and school and developing inexpensive, alternate models of delivery.@@@When we speak of transformation and resilience, we must prioritize the climate emergency, in which the Pacific is on the front lines.@@@Climate change continues to ravage our planet, and the global community has once again failed to take the actions required to curb its spread.@@@We can no longer continue to debate the human impact on our planet and when and if we will band together to mount a fight against the climate emergency and its undeniable security implications.@@@The maintenance of international peace and security demands that we unite with a shared understanding of the threats and challenges we face.@@@Nauru continues its call upon the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security, and to immediately undertake an assessment of the capacity of the United Nations to respond to climate disasters.@@@Climate change has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and our response must therefore be equally diverse and robust.@@@While we are hopeful for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we are not naive regarding the reality that the work in this arena is far from the urgency and scale required.@@@Major emitters are lacking in both commitment and action to reduce emissions.@@@We need stronger commitments and actions that move past pretty words on paper.@@@Nauru, like other small island nations, has lived with the realities of climate change for some time now.@@@Climate change undermines and threatens the ability of Governments and institutions to deliver basic services in the short and long term.@@@The Higher Ground Initiative is crucial to our ability to reclaim land that is now unusable, land that presents us with both an urgent need and an expensive financing venture.@@@Hence, we seek both financial and technical assistance for the completion and implementation of the master plan for a pilot plot.@@@If successful, this pilot plot can transform the future of Nauru, ensuring that our homeland can continue for generations to come.@@@There also remains a serious and pressing need for climate-resilient infrastructure.@@@Nauru faces significant delays in its port redevelopment project, a project that represents both a crucial domestic need and an international example of climate-resilient infrastructure.@@@However, as a consequence of the pandemic, Nauru now faces unprecedented delays and unforeseen added costs beyond its national capacities.@@@We join other vulnerable nations in the call for practical financial solutions to these unforeseen challenges to key adaptation measures.@@@Global transformation requires a global energy transition, and we welcome the ongoing work from the High-Level Dialogue on Energy and work being undertaken to meet Sustainable Development Goal 7.@@@A just and inclusive energy transition requires that no one, and no country, is left behind, and reaching these goals will require international financial and technical support.@@@Moreover, it will require that we rethink how we get energy and where that energy comes from.@@@We cannot expect the trajectory of global emissions to drop without access to viable energy alternatives.@@@Deep-sea minerals provide us with a solution.@@@Polymetallic nodules will transform big and small countries’ energy systems with an accessible alternative and a pathway to a just energy transition.@@@This is a priority for Nauru at the International Seabed Authority, and we continue to call for more support and investment to ensure the establishment and adherence to robust governance mechanisms in this field.@@@We must not lose focus towards our shared goals of a just and inclusive energy transition as we work to complete the two-year timeline to establish the global regulatory framework for deep seabed minerals.@@@Nauru is a big ocean State.@@@We are people of the ocean, and our lives are inextricably linked to the Pacific Ocean.@@@The ocean has shaped who we are, as it has similarly shaped the nations and peoples of other small island developing States.@@@But we must transform our relationship with the ocean if it is to continue to sustain us and future generations.@@@We express our disappointment that the work of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction was not completed.@@@We are committed to overcoming issues of divergence in these negotiations.@@@Issues that are very important to island nations, such as the special circumstances and shared vulnerabilities of small island developing States (SIDS), must be recognized.@@@This is not new.@@@We must also come to consensus on benefit sharing on the high seas, especially as it relates to marine genetic resources.@@@This is crucial for the economic diversity of island nations and is an integral part of the blue economy.@@@Finally, we raise, as we have before, the critical importance of ensuring sustainable fisheries.@@@This includes ensuring that overfishing is not taking place, that fair prices are paid to small islands for fish taken from our waters, and that we eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.@@@Nauru remains committed to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement.@@@These historic agreements outline our shared optimism for the future, and they provide us with the means and metrics to reach our ambition.@@@However, they are in danger of not being worth the paper they are printed on without adequate and predictable support from the international community, as Nauru and many other island nations will not be able to realize the Sustainable Development Goals or to adapt and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.@@@The ability to access sustainable financing determines whether we succeed or fail.@@@Nauru, like many SIDS, faces barriers to sustained economic growth due to our geographic remoteness, the small scale of our economy, vulnerabilities to climate change, external economic and financial shocks and the rules that govern development assistance.@@@For years, small island developing States have reiterated the limitations of per capita income as a measure of development.@@@This arbitrary measure does not adequately consider our special circumstances and unique vulnerabilities.@@@Nauru stresses the importance of the ongoing work on the multidimensional vulnerability index for small island developing States and reiterates the importance of its establishment.@@@Although the process of finalizing and adopting the index has moved at a slower rate than anticipated or desired, we nonetheless thank and commend the High-Level Panel of the development of the index for their ongoing work thus far.@@@Undoubtedly, such crucial work as the index cannot be hurried.@@@In that light, Nauru calls for Member States to universally agree and adopt the index once finalized, thus contributing to ensuring that efforts are tailored to the needs of the most vulnerable, as required.@@@As we commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, Nauru, as a State party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), encourages those Member States who have yet to ratify the TPNW to do so, so that we are united in the global goal for a peaceful and just world free of nuclear weapons.@@@We are facing a time of great risk and uncertainty.@@@This can, however, also be a time of opportunity and transformation.@@@To ensure that no one is left behind, our joint post-pandemic recovery efforts must be embedded and upheld in institutions and practices of good governance.@@@We must be careful to not compromise on good governance practices under pressures to build back faster and better.@@@We reiterate our commitment to the principles of good governance as we undertake our national general elections, and we call on Member States to observe and actively strengthen and promote good governance both domestically and internationally.@@@In conclusion, allow me to express our hope that this year will allow us to be open to the transformation we seek.@@@As scripture guides us, in Romans 12:2, “do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind”.@@@May God bless the Republic of Nauru, and may God bless the United Nations.@@@On behalf of the Georgian people, it is an honour to speak to members again at the General Assembly.@@@As we gather for the seventy-seventh session, we reflect on our founding principles and the progress we have made as an international community since the creation of the United Nations.@@@At the first session held in 1946, the founders vowed to unite to maintain global peace and security.@@@While we have made significant advances, we must acknowledge the ongoing acts of aggression against members of this organ — the very same types of action that led to the establishment of the United Nations after the Second World War.@@@In 2008, my country, Georgia, was attacked by Russia, resulting in the ongoing occupation of 20 per cent of our territory.@@@At the time, the international community recognized that aggression.@@@But as we have learned, the world’s democracies must act as one to ensure that freedom and peace prevail.@@@The United Nations was founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and protect State sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@That is our duty.@@@That is our promise.@@@Today I have the privilege of representing Georgia — a strong, proud, freedom-loving nation that has preserved its sacred heritage and history, while also evolving and adapting to the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century.@@@Thirty years ago, Georgia became part of the United Nations family.@@@Now more than ever, we are committed to protecting our shared values, in our region and worldwide.@@@We seek all opportunities for collaboration with our international partners to advance the cause of peace.@@@In that regard, the Geneva International Discussions are particularly crucial for bringing the Russian Federation to the table to address the implementation of the 2008 ceasefire agreement mediated by the European Union (EU).@@@Georgia appreciates the international community’s support for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@Although my country is still occupied by Russia, we do not let that difficult challenge define us.@@@We continue to punch above our weight and contribute to the international community.@@@Since our Government came to power in 2012, we have implemented an ambitious reform agenda that has brought us closer to our key international partners, the EU, the United States, NATO and the United Nations.@@@For the first time since we regained independence, Georgia and the Georgian people have enjoyed an unprecedented decade of peace, prosperity and stability.@@@We are continuously working on Georgia’s global positioning and are already reaping the rewards.@@@According to the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index 2021, Georgia is first in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.@@@The Open Budget Survey 2021 ranked Georgia first in the world in terms of budget transparency.@@@And according to the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World: 2021 Annual Report, Georgia is among the top five economies, along with Singapore and Switzerland.@@@NUMBEO named Georgia one of the world’s safest countries, ranking it fourteenth globally.@@@Our work to align more closely with the United States and Europe goes hand and hand with our commitment to continued democratic transformation.@@@Increased Euro-Atlantic and European integration is our way of returning to the family of European nations, with which we share history, culture and — most important — values.@@@We are continuing on our unequivocal path towards European and Euro- Atlantic integration.@@@Our commitment to those goals is backed up by actions and real results, including an Association Agreement with the EU, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area and a visa-free travel arrangement with the EU.@@@This year, we applied for full EU membership.@@@The historic decision of the European Council to recognize the European perspective of Georgia created a new set of benchmarks.@@@Just as in the past, Georgia will meet and exceed those benchmarks.@@@The prospect of acceding to the EU is strong motivation for our country and our citizens.@@@We are fully aware that the European perspective comes with the responsibility to achieve the highest political, economic and legal convergence with the European Union.@@@Georgia immediately responded to the European Council’s decision by presenting a very concrete action plan to address the Union’s 12 priorities.@@@That inclusive process ensures the full engagement of all branches of the Government, the opposition parties and civil society.@@@Working groups have been established in Parliament for each priority area with all relevant stakeholders.@@@We are making progress and are well ahead of schedule.@@@Let me be clear: Georgia deserves EU member candidate status, which will bring us to eventual membership and make the dream of generations a reality.@@@We have developed a long-term development strategy — Vision 2030 — a nationwide policy document that covers the key directives and priorities of our general development by 2030 and fully complies with the 2020 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Georgia also has in place a new national strategy for human rights protection for the years 2022-2030.@@@The Government approved that strategy following discussions with both international partners and domestic civil society organizations.@@@It aims to further improve human rights protection standards and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@It is a comprehensive document that covers all fundamental human rights and freedoms.@@@We are working with the world’s leading firms and brightest minds to transform Georgia into a true multidimensional regional hub.@@@Our financial services sector is globally recognized, and we now attract international investors, injecting additional funds into the education and health-care sectors.@@@The startup ecosystem is thriving, and the logistics and energy potential have been realized.@@@Collectively, those developments have created a sustainable and predictable economy for Georgia and its people.@@@Our Government’s sound policies led to a strong recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with economic growth that reached 10.4 per cent in 2021 and far exceeded expectations from January to July 2022, at 10.3 per cent.@@@According to the International Monetary Fund, our growth projections have reached 9 per cent for 2022, primarily due to our Government’s proactive measures to minimize the impacts of post-COVID-19 recovery and the war in Ukraine.@@@We are creating opportunities and giving all the necessary tools to our citizens, including those living in Georgia’s occupied territories.@@@For that reason, here today at the General Assembly I would like to speak directly to my Abkhaz and Ossetian brothers and sisters and once again tell them that our strength is in unity.@@@We will build Georgia together and peacefully turn it into a prosperous, free and unified European State.@@@War is raging again, not far from my country’s doorstep.@@@Russia’s full-fledged war in Ukraine undermines that country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law.@@@Georgia stands with Ukraine.@@@Since the start of the war, my Government has provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including the allocation of more than 1,000 tons of humanitarian aid.@@@Georgia is providing financial assistance and accommodation to more than 32,000 Ukrainians currently residing in Georgia.@@@The Georgian education system has enrolled more than 1,500 Ukrainian students, many of whom receive general education in the Ukrainian language according to the standard Ukrainian curriculums.@@@We have sponsored, joined or supported almost 400 resolutions, statements, joint statements and other initiatives made or proposed by major international organizations and institutions in support of Ukraine and were among the main sponsors of resolution ES-11/2, on the humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine.@@@As confirmed by the United States Department of State report on the investment climate in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia and Georgian financial institutions act fully in accordance with the financial sanctions imposed by the United States and others on the Russian Federation.@@@We have aligned with the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union against Crimea and Sevastopol as of 2014 and those imposed against Donetsk and Luhansk as of this year.@@@As the conflict in Ukraine has shown, the wider security of the Black Sea is at the forefront of the Euro- Atlantic security agenda.@@@Georgia, as an indivisible part of the regional architecture, is ready to increase our contribution to common security.@@@As we know well, security brings stability and stability brings
predictability, which is a crucial precondition for sustainable economic development.@@@Therefore, the more predictable the Black Sea region becomes, the more we can unlock its economic potential for the benefit of our people and the global economy.@@@For that reason, we are developing strategic transport corridors to connect Asia with Europe.@@@Georgia is participating in several international initiatives and infrastructure projects with our European colleagues in order to improve connectivity and facilitate reliable and efficient commerce across the Black Sea.@@@Despite the complex situation in our region, we spare no effort to foster rapprochement between our neighbours.@@@We have already had success stories, including the safe return of 15 Armenian detainees to their homeland in exchange for maps of mined territories in Azerbaijan.@@@In July of this year, the Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia met in Tbilisi for the first time.@@@We are ready to serve as a venue for that dialogue to bring much-needed peace and stability to our region.@@@With that in mind, Georgia has been promoting the Peaceful Neighbourhood Initiative, which envisions participation by all three States of the South Caucasus.@@@That new initiative does not substitute, counter or oppose any other cooperation formats.@@@Georgia wishes to serve as an honest broker to aid in normalizing regional relations.@@@We are also heavily investing in our country’s infrastructure in order to increase Georgian transit capabilities for the benefit of the region.@@@We aim to attract greater institutional foreign investment, facilitate projects of regional importance and strengthen our infrastructural capabilities, thereby becoming an actual bridge between East and West.@@@Our goal is to transform the South Caucasus into a region of opportunity and economic growth.@@@We are already discussing with our EU counterparts a list of flagship projects that will bring about additional economic synergies and serve as a catalyst for more connectivity and integration with the European Union and European markets.@@@We believe that all countries of the South Caucasus and allies from the West will benefit from that collaboration.@@@We must act now to secure the Black Sea, protect energy routes, maintain supply chains and increase regional connectivity in order to foster greater economic development.@@@Those actions are all essential to European peace and prosperity.@@@We are mindful that our regional challenges must be addressed against the backdrop of global challenges, such as international security, the ongoing pandemic and climate change.@@@Georgia is contributing to global peace and the rules-based international order.@@@For more than two decades, Georgia has contributed to NATO missions around the world, serving as one of the largest per capita contributors to the mission in Afghanistan.@@@We have lost many brave soldiers and suffered significant casualties, with hundreds wounded in those missions.@@@Georgia reiterates its readiness to stand by NATO in protecting common security while continuing to support EU-led missions.@@@As I speak here today, dangers that we can no longer ignore are threatening all of humankind.@@@The planetary crises created by climate change, from biodiversity loss to pollution, represent an existential threat.@@@Like many challenges, climate change affects developing nations first, hindering their ability to realize the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In Georgia, our Government has made significant investments in education, public health and the environment in order to ensure that future generations can thrive.@@@Education systems are critical for empowering prosperous and productive societies.@@@Education in the twenty-first century means investing in digital literacy and promoting infrastructure in order to bridge the digital divide and ensure that future crises, whether related to public health, war or climate change, do not create dire situations.@@@In conclusion, I believe that, working together, we shall return peace and prosperity to our homes and countries.@@@That has been the spirit and the mandate vested in the United Nations from its founding — to support and ensure peace and cooperation.@@@I am proud to represent my country before the Assembly today.@@@After three decades of restored independence, Georgian dreams are becoming a reality.@@@Our nation, the history of which goes back thousands of years, has in recent decades become an example of resilience and progress in the face of extraordinary challenges.@@@With our international partners, I am confident that we will build a brighter, more peaceful and prosperous world, now and for the generations to follow.@@@First, I would like to extend congratulations to you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish you every success in that highly responsible capacity.@@@You can count on the full support of the Republic of Azerbaijan throughout your tenure.@@@I also wish to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his hard work over the past year.@@@Azerbaijan is well known for its contribution to promoting intercultural and interfaith dialogue.@@@The Baku process launched in 2008 by the Government of Azerbaijan, together with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) and others, has set standards and agendas for dialogue and intercultural cooperation.@@@The important role of the Baku process in advocating dialogue among cultures has been recognized in the reports of the Secretary-General.@@@Based on the successful experience of the Baku process, Azerbaijan, in partnership with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and ISESCO, launched in June 2021 a new international initiative entitled Peace4Culture Global Call, the aim of which is to contribute to sustainable peace, development and the protection of cultural heritage.@@@We believe that this initiative will be equally successful, and invite all countries and international organizations to join this project.@@@The world continues to face the serious challenges that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has raised.@@@Despite the fact that expanding vaccination rates and the increasing adaptivity of the global population to new realities offer a glimpse of hope for the post-COVID period, serious challenges remain.@@@All immediate and long-term challenges brought by the pandemic necessitate new mechanisms supported, by high-level political engagement, that would provide a comprehensive framework for global cooperation and solidarity.@@@From the very beginning, Azerbaijan, in its national capacity and as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has advocated greater global solidarity to overcome the pandemic and put forward a number of global initiatives to that end.@@@The initiative of President Ilham Aliyev, in his capacity as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, to convene a special session of the General Assembly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enjoyed broad support of the United Nations membership.@@@On behalf of NAM, Azerbaijan also submitted resolutions on ensuring equal, affordable, timely and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, which were adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council with the overwhelming support of Member States.@@@Along with an effective vaccination campaign in the country, Azerbaijan has donated a significant number of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need.@@@We have provided international assistance to more than 80 countries to combat the pandemic.@@@We will continue our endeavours aimed at further strengthening international cooperation in addressing the consequences of the pandemic and consolidating efforts for global recovery from COVID-19.@@@The President of Azerbaijan, in that regard, has initiated the establishment of a high-level United Nations panel on post-pandemic global recovery, which will be among the topics to be elaborated on at the upcoming summit-level meeting of the NAM Contact Group in response to COVID-19, to be held in Baku in the coming months.@@@Since gaining its independence, Azerbaijan has made a long journey, transforming from a country with imposed security challenges on its own soil into a contributor to global security.@@@Along the way, Azerbaijan has been a strong and reliable partner of the United Nations, staunchly supported it and actively contributed to its activities.@@@Both in its national capacity and as current Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, Azerbaijan is keen to continue contributing to peace and security, strengthening the international legal order and enhancing dialogue, global solidarity and multilateralism.@@@We also look forward to the Summit of the Future, its intergovernmentally negotiated outcome and a new agenda for peace as an opportunity to reinvigorate global action and reflect on collective commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and multilateralism.@@@Azerbaijan is fully committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We have launched a new development strategy up to 2030, which goes hand in hand with the 2030 Agenda.@@@Over the past year, Azerbaijan has progressed further in terms of its achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and is ranked in the top 50 countries in the United Nations Sustainable Development Report 2022.@@@Azerbaijan is among 12 countries that have submitted three voluntary national reviews to the High-level Political Forum, held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council.@@@We pursue transformational changes in remodelling our economy to make the transition to a green and circular economy.@@@The clean environment and green growth have been identified as among the five priority areas of our new national development strategy.@@@This transition stands high on our development agenda, despite the fact that the oil and gas sector plays a significant role in our economy.@@@It is against that backdrop that the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan rose by 11 per cent in the first half of 2022, triggering an increase in our gross domestic product by 7.2 per cent.@@@Currently, Azerbaijan is one of the few countries worldwide that are gradually mainstreaming sustainable energy into its development agenda, while being a reliable hydrocarbons exporter to international markets.@@@We will increase our profile in that regard, including by introducing new elements of alternative and renewable energy as well.@@@A recently concluded European Union-Azerbaijan memorandum of understanding on a strategic partnership in the field of energy is a good example of Azerbaijan’s constructive input into global energy security.@@@Sustainability has also been mainstreamed in postconflict reconstruction and rehabilitation activities, including in the liberated territories.@@@New cities and villages are now being built from scratch by applying modern urban planning methods, the concepts of “smart city” and “smart village”.@@@After the war, $3 billion have already been allocated from the State budget for those purposes, and Azerbaijan is keen to invest even more in the future.@@@The liberated area has been designated as a green energy zone.@@@Positioned at the crossroads of North-South and East-West transport corridors, Azerbaijan is a rising transit country.@@@Corridors and routes passing through Azerbaijan offer competitive advantages for transport operators and businesses in terms of high-end infrastructure and fast, secure transit traffic.@@@This year marks thirtieth anniversary of admission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to membership of the United Nations.@@@Since becoming part of the United Nations family, Azerbaijan has consistently demonstrated its strong commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@We joined the United Nations at a time when the very principles, that the Organization stands for were being blatantly violated in relation to Azerbaijan.@@@In those difficult times, the United Nations stood with Azerbaijan in defending the core values enshrined in its Charter.@@@Azerbaijan suffered grievously from the aggression of Armenia in the early 1990s, at the core of which were groundless territorial claims, misinterpretations of international law, fabricated historical narratives and racist motivations.@@@Back then, the Security Council unanimously expressed its support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan, and demanded the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Azerbaijani territories, as did the General Assembly.@@@In the course of its aggression, Armenia occupied 20 per cent of Azerbaijan’s territory.@@@Twenty thousand Azerbaijanis were killed and more than 1 million became refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).@@@Almost 4,000 citizens of Azerbaijan, civilian and military alike, remain missing in connection with the conflict.@@@Armenia has inflicted long-term damage on the environment in Azerbaijan.@@@Also, thousands of Azerbaijani cultural heritage objects have been destroyed, plundered or misappropriated by Armenia.@@@Earlier this year, ISESCO sent a technical mission to Azerbaijan to undertake a post-conflict state of conservation assessment of the cultural heritage in its liberated territories.@@@For decades, Azerbaijan has called on Armenia to support an independent, transparent UNESCO mission to assess and advise on the protection and preservation of cultural heritage in the region.@@@Although the Armenian occupation of Azerbaijan’s territory ended in 2020, a UNESCO mission has yet to arrive, and I once again publicly call for such a mission.@@@The scale of violations and destruction demonstrates a clear intent and purpose to terrorize, kill and expel Azerbaijani civilians and erase all traces of Azerbaijan from those territories.@@@Within almost 30 years, Armenia, having committed ethnic cleansing, carried out an illegal settlement policy by transferring Armenians en masse from Armenia and third countries to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, with the aim of preventing Azerbaijanis from return to their places of origin and securing the annexation of these territories.@@@Conflict resolution efforts under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe yielded no results.@@@Almost 30 years on, in the autumn of 2020, Azerbaijan, in response to yet another large-scale military provocation by Armenia and guided by the inherent rights conferred upon the Member States by the United Nations Charter, launched a counteroffensive operation.@@@As a result, Azerbaijan liberated its territories and the three-decade armed conflict was resolved by military and political means, in line with the trilateral statement signed by the leaders of Azerbaijan, Russia and Armenia on 10 November 2020.@@@The trilateral statement announced the end of all military activities between Armenia and Azerbaijan.@@@It set the parameters for consolidating peace in the region, such as the complete withdrawal of all Armenian armed units from the territory of Azerbaijan, the return of displaced persons and the unblocking of all economic and transport connections in the region.@@@Azerbaijan has now embarked upon unprecedented recovery and reconstruction activities in the liberated territories and prioritized their full reintegration.@@@Such activities are aimed at finally enabling hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons to return to their homes in safety and dignity and at ensuring a peaceful life in conflict-affected territories.@@@The first families have recently returned to Aghali village, in the liberated Zangilan district of Azerbaijan.@@@Azerbaijan is resolved to reintegrate its citizens of Armenian origin residing in conflict-affected territories into its political, social and economic space, guaranteeing them the same rights and freedoms enjoyed by all the citizens of Azerbaijan regardless of their ethnic, religious or any other affiliation.@@@The Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan provides a solid legal framework in this regard.@@@One of the major impediments to the ongoing recovery and reconstruction efforts and the safe return of displaced persons is a massive contamination of liberated territories by landmines and other explosive devices, and the continued refusal of Armenia to provide accurate and complete information on mined areas.@@@Over the years of occupation of and during withdrawal of its forces from Azerbaijani territories, Armenia heavily and indiscriminately contaminated those areas with mines and other explosive hazards.@@@Since the signing of trilateral statement, more than 240 Azerbaijani civilians and military have been killed or seriously injured by mine explosions.@@@Obtaining the maps of minefields, along with targeted and sustainable international technical and financial assistance to further strengthen and increase national mine action capacities and efforts in Azerbaijan, will be critically important to saving lives and strengthening peace.@@@Sustainable United Nations support and adequate and predictable mine action funding are indispensable.@@@Azerbaijan is committed to regional peace, stability and development.@@@The establishment of good- neighbourly relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan is key to building a secure, stable and prosperous South Caucasus through full-fledged regional normalization.@@@Along with carrying out large-scale recovery and reconstruction works in the liberated territories, and pursuing the reintegration of residents in conflict- affected territories, Azerbaijan has initiated the process of normalizing inter-State relations with Armenia based on mutual recognition and respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within their State borders.@@@On numerous occasions, Azerbaijan has expressed its readiness to start negotiations on peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has established its national delegation to that end.@@@Equally, Azerbaijan has undertaken efforts to start the process of the delimitation and demarcation of state borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan, unblocking transportation and communication links, including the establishment of the Zangezur corridor, which is a part of the international transportation network.@@@Notwithstanding the increased dynamism in contacts, including direct dialogue between Armenia and Azerbaijan in recent months, Armenia seems to be sticking to its past practice of engaging in sham negotiations, and instead implementing its commitments in good faith, frequently resorts to provocations and sabotage to exacerbate tensions and undermine ongoing normalization process with Azerbaijan.@@@Armenia has not fully withdrawn its armed forces from Azerbaijani territories, as stipulated by the 10 November trilateral statement, and continues a variety of military activities within the territories of Azerbaijan, including planting landmines.@@@Recently, massive numbers of anti-personnel mines produced in Armenia in 2021 have been found in the Lachin district of Azerbaijan.@@@Following a series of political and military provocations, especially after the fourth Brussels meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Armenia resorted to another large-scale military provocation along the undelimited State borderline in the night of 12 to 13 September, attempting to plant mines on the roads between the military positions of Azerbaijan, taking advantage of the night and the complex terrain.@@@Later, Armenia, using weapons of different calibres, opened fire on Azerbaijani positions, which caused losses among the military personnel of Azerbaijan and inflicted significant damage on its military infrastructure.@@@Azerbaijan took adequate measures to neutralize the threat against its sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure the safety of its personnel, as well as civilian personnel involved in reconstruction works in the area.@@@The armed forces of Azerbaijan demonstrated the utmost restraint and professionalism, and limited themselves to exclusively targeting Armenia’s firing positions with high-precision weapons to suppress its attacks on the positions of Azerbaijan.@@@Armenia clearly attempted a further escalation to manipulate the attention of the international community.@@@Thus, Armenia disregarded the ceasefire agreed on 13 September and continued shelling the territory of Azerbaijan, including with high-calibre weapons and artillery.@@@As a result, Azerbaijan suffered further losses and casualties, included 80 servicemen killed and 282 servicemen and 2 civilians wounded.@@@Contrary to such reckless actions of Armenia, Azerbaijan exercised the utmost restraint, took several steps, including through contacts with relevant international partners, and demonstrated good faith and genuine will to restore the ceasefire.@@@Eventually the ceasefire was restored effective 8 p.m. on 14 September through direct communication channels between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and is being maintained, as confirmed by both sides.@@@In the aftermath of the escalation, Azerbaijan has been engaged in addressing the humanitarian consequences.@@@In that context, it declared its willingness to return to Armenia the remains of deceased military personnel on a unilateral basis, and informed the International Committee of the Red Cross accordingly.@@@Azerbaijan is not and cannot be interested in tension.@@@As a matter of fact, the latest hostilities erupted in close proximity to areas where impressive large-scale post-conflict investment, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects are under way.@@@Furthermore, the latest escalation of tension fits very well into the pattern we have observed over the past 30 years from Armenia.@@@Each time a decisive stage has been reached towards a breakthrough, Armenia has resorted to similar serious provocation as a mean of shirking the responsibility of taking necessary decisions.@@@We would have wished that the current leadership of Armenia were not following the path of its predecessors by deliberately closing yet again the window of opportunity for peace and security in the region.@@@Azerbaijan is resolute in further repelling any threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the safety of its citizens, and urges Armenia to refrain from further escalating the situation.@@@Instead, Armenia has to constructively engage in the ongoing normalization process in order to establish a predictable, stable situation in the region through the establishment of good-neighbourly relations.@@@In that context, following the agreement reached at the fourth meeting of the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia with the President of the European Council, held on 31 August in Brussels, Azerbaijan reiterated to Armenia its readiness to start practical work on the peace treaty without further delay.@@@Immediately after the meeting, we proposed a concrete date and venue to Armenia for such talks.@@@Two days ago we listened to the statement delivered here by the Prime Minister of Armenia (see A/77/ PV.9).@@@Regrettably, this was yet further evidence demonstrating that the Armenian side seems focused on continuing the confrontation instead of normalization.@@@In Azerbaijan, we believe that our region has seen enough confrontation, destruction and suffering.@@@It is high time for both our nations to engage fully and wholeheartedly in post-conflict normalization so that we can finally turn the tragic page of our history and start building a better future for our children.@@@The commitment of the Azerbaijani side is there.@@@We hope that Armenia will finally reciprocate constructively and engage genuinely in the negotiations.@@@Having liberated its territories from a long-term foreign military occupation, Azerbaijan is determined to spare no effort towards their full reconstruction and reintegration, in accordance with the highest possible standards.@@@At the same time, our country will continue to play the role of responsible member of the international community in all relevant fields, whether it is contributing to global energy security, helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic or promoting sustainable development.@@@We believe that, in a globalized world, no country is an island, and we act accordingly.@@@It is my honour to speak on behalf of Australia in the venerated General Assembly Hall, which signifies so much to the world’s peoples.@@@It remains the only place where the whole world has agreed to come together, recognizing that we can solve our biggest problems only together; recognizing that progress and development are preconditions for peace; and recognizing that, to avoid conflict, we must talk to each other and we must listen to each other.@@@It is my honour to speak on behalf of a country that is home to people from more than 300 different ancestries and to the oldest continuous culture on the planet.@@@Like this Hall, Australia is an assembly of the world’s peoples.@@@When Australians look out to the world, we see ourselves reflected in it.@@@Equally, the world can see itself reflected in Australia, a nation whose people share common ground with so many of the world’s
peoples.@@@It is a nation where half of our people were born overseas or have a parent born overseas.@@@I am one of those people, and the Australian Parliament I serve in is ever more reflective of our modern nation, both enriched by their diversity.@@@That follows the collective decision of the Australian people to turn the page and write a new future for themselves.@@@Newly elected parliamentarians have origins from across the world and indigenous Australians have been elected in record numbers and serve in the Ministry in record numbers.@@@The new Australian Government is determined to make real progress on the national journey of healing with indigenous Australians — the first peoples of our continent.@@@As Foreign Minister, I am determined to see First Nations perspectives at the heart of Australian foreign policy.@@@This week, I have been encouraged by discussions with other countries on their own journeys.@@@I am humbled to be guided in those efforts by First Nations colleagues.@@@Here in New York, I am joined by Senator Patrick Dodson.@@@To many Australians, Senator Dodson is the father of reconciliation.@@@Senator Dodson is a Yawuru man from Broome, in the remote northwest of Australia.@@@Like many First Nations people, he walks in two worlds — as a Senator and leader in our Parliament; and as an elder, native title holder and ceremony man for his people.@@@In our Government, Senator Dodson has been tasked with responding to a call from First Nations people for a constitutionally enshrined voice to the Australian Parliament, as well as treaty and truth-telling.@@@With daunting challenges facing the world, we have much to learn from First Nations peoples, both at home and in international forums.@@@Elevating First Nations voices, including right here, has never been more important.@@@Our nation’s history and present show that, like anything human — indeed, like this institution in which we gather — we are not perfect.@@@But we aim ever-higher and we look to make our contribution to the world.@@@Australians see our country as it is and we see our world as it is, and we seek to shape them for the better.@@@Sharing common ground with so many of the world’s peoples means that Australians want to see the interests of all the world’s peoples upheld, along with our own.@@@That aim of today’s Australia accords with the ambition of an Australian who helped shape the Charter of the United Nations, our former Foreign Minister and the third President of the General Assembly, Mr. Herbert Evatt.@@@At the 1945 San Francisco Conference, where the Charter was written, Mr. Evatt challenged the great Powers.@@@They wanted a strong Security Council that had control over the General Assembly.@@@Mr. Evatt did not succeed in his fight against the great Powers’ veto within the Security Council, but he did succeed in ensuring that the General Assembly had the ability to decide its own course and could address any matter that falls within the Charter of the United Nations or the powers and functions of any of its organs.@@@He understood that small and medium-sized countries cannot simply allow their fates to be decided by the great Powers.@@@He understood that small and medium-sized countries must be able to maintain their sovereign choices, protected by a stable framework of rules.@@@He also understood that, in order to maintain those sovereign choices, the small and medium-sized countries of the world, including Australia, must work together.@@@Those are legacies that we renew today.@@@Mr. Evatt also saw economic and social security as the precondition for peace.@@@He pressed the San Francisco Conference to ensure that the United Nations addressed the broadest range of social, economic and human rights issues, saying:
“Real stability... can only be achieved by building an organization that will do its utmost to assure the peoples of the world a full opportunity in living in freedom from want as well as in freedom from external aggression.”@@@Some did not want to extend the ambit of the United Nations to economic and social development.@@@On behalf of Australia, Evatt insisted.@@@Again, those are legacies Australia renews today.@@@Despite inheriting the biggest debt in our nation’s history, the new Australian Government is determined to play its part in supporting the development of other nations, particularly in our region.@@@We are alarmed that, for the first time, the United Nations Human Development Index declined for two consecutive years, in 2020 and 2021.@@@The impact of that decline has been most severe on women and girls, with nearly half a billion women and girls now living in extreme poverty.@@@The global food security crisis is increasingly grave.@@@More than 800 million people go to bed hungry every night, 345 million people face acute food insecurity, and
50 million people across 45 countries are on the brink of famine.@@@That is a growing scale of human suffering that threatens untold global instability.@@@Australia is increasing our contribution to development assistance by over a billion dollars.@@@If we are ever to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which represent our collective vision for minimum living standards for everyone living on this planet, every country needs to do more.@@@Over the coming months, we are designing a new development policy outlining how we will play our part in an era of crisis and how we will help developing countries without driving them into unsustainable debt.@@@The world has experienced disasters and conflict in the past, but the intensity and confluence of today’s challenges in an interconnected world are without precedent.@@@The coronavirus disease has set back development gains.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has unleashed further suffering and made it harder for populations to recover from the pandemic.@@@Drought and potential famine plague the Horn of Africa.@@@We have seen major floods in Pakistan and record-breaking heatwaves in Europe and Asia.@@@The alarm bells of climate change are growing louder, including in my own country.@@@Australians are clear that they want urgent and serious action, and they have given their Government a mandate.@@@Among the first acts of the new Australian Government has been to submit our ambitious nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we have just passed legislation that makes those targets law.@@@Our climate policies mean that within this decade, 83 per cent of Australia’s energy supply will be renewable.@@@We want to help the global energy transition.@@@Australia will be a renewable energy super-Power.@@@And while we are playing our part to reduce our own emissions, we are working in our region to support Pacific countries, which have the most to lose from the changing climate.@@@Nothing is more central to the security and economies of the Pacific than climate change.@@@As Pacific leaders themselves put it plainly in the first article of the 2018 Pacific Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security, we reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progressing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Australians are part of the Pacific family, and families are about care, love and forgiveness.@@@But they are also about duty and loyalty, looking out for each other and listening to each other.@@@The Australian people want to be better, more involved and more helpful members of the Pacific family.@@@In my first months as Foreign Minister, I have visited six Pacific Islands Forum countries.@@@It is a clear sign of our priorities that, by the end of this year, I will have visited nearly all of them.@@@Australians want to enhance our defence, maritime and economic cooperation with Pacific Island countries because our peace and prosperity are one.@@@And we want to be the Pacific’s partner of choice for development and security.@@@We are increasing our development assistance to the Pacific by over half a billion dollars, and we are working with our Pacific partners to address our shared challenges and implement the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@We want to bridge our cooperation across the Pacific and South-East Asia to address shared challenges and to build the region we want.@@@Australia seeks deeper engagement with South- East Asia.@@@It is a region I know well.@@@It is the region I am from.@@@The region is being reshaped, and Australia seeks to work with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to shape this period of change together.@@@Australia seeks a region that is peaceful and predictable; that is governed by accepted rules and norms, where all our countries and peoples can cooperate, trade and thrive; where our relations are based on respect and partnership and guided by the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific; where all States can contribute to a strategic equilibrium in a regional order in which countries are not required to choose sides, but can make their own sovereign choices.@@@We recognize we must bring more to the table in South-East Asia.@@@That starts with an additional $470 million in development assistance and a forthcoming strategy on economic engagement.@@@We must contribute to the strategic balance of the region.@@@We do not want to see any one country dominating or any country being dominated.@@@We cannot accept a situation where large countries determine the fate of smaller countries.@@@That is why Russia’s illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine cannot be normalized and cannot be minimized.@@@Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an attack on all smaller countries.@@@It is an
assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller neighbour to decide whether another country can even exist.@@@It was never intended that the Security Council veto power would be used to enable unchecked abuse of the Charter of the United Nations by the very countries that were given the veto.@@@So it is especially important for countries that play leading roles in international forums and countries with influence on Russia to exert their influence to end that war.@@@In that regard, the world looks to China, a great Power, a permanent member of the Security Council with a no-limits partnership with Russia.@@@Mr. Putin’s weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all and the urgent need for progress on nuclear disarmament.@@@Australia has always pursued a world without nuclear weapons.@@@We will redouble our efforts towards that goal and to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.@@@The death and destruction in Ukraine remind us all how much we have to lose if we fail to protect the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It reminds us that each nation must make its own choices and exercise its own agency.@@@We cannot leave it to the big Powers, and we cannot be passive when big Powers flout the rules.@@@Aside from terrible damage and the loss of life in Ukraine, Russia’s invasion is compounding human suffering and propelling the global crisis in food and energy security.@@@In my own region, where geopolitical contest becomes ever sharper, we must ensure that competition does not escalate into conflict, because if conflict were to break out in the Indo-Pacific, it would be catastrophic for our people and our prosperity.@@@And with the Indo-Pacific’s centrality to global prosperity and security, the cost would extend far beyond our region and reach into every life.@@@So I say to small and medium-sized nations like my own: We are more than just supporting players in a grand drama of global geopolitics on a stage dominated by great Powers.@@@It is up to all of us to create the kind of world to which we aspire — stable, peaceful, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty.@@@That is the very rationale for the United Nations itself.@@@It is up to all of us to ask ourselves how we can each use our State power, our influence, our networks and our capabilities to avert catastrophic conflict.@@@How do we acquit our responsibilities to constrain tensions, to apply the brakes before the momentum for conflict in our region or beyond becomes unstoppable?@@@Australia is resolved to those tasks in all our diplomacy in the United Nations and beyond.@@@It is why we seek a seat on the Security Council for 2029-2030.@@@It is why we seek reform of the Security Council, with greater permanent representation for Africa, Latin America and Asia, including India and Japan.@@@Being genuinely committed to the United Nations means being genuinely committed to reforming the United Nations and keeping it vital.@@@We know that we will always be better off in a world where rules and norms — whether on trade, the maritime domain or military engagement, on the environment or human rights — are clear, mutually negotiated and consistently followed.@@@History teaches us that the alternative to what we have built here is conflict and chaos — a world where differences and disputes are settled by size and power alone, instead of by agreed rules and norms.@@@Humankind has benefited from the multilateral system.@@@Humankind has benefited from the rules that have underpinned an unequalled period of human development.@@@Humankind will pay the price if we allow it to flounder — every nation and all our peoples.@@@The theme for this General Assembly is indeed an appropriate one, for this truly is a watershed moment.@@@As I was preparing for my address today, I thought to myself, “What is it that the people we represent want most?@@@What do they expect of their leaders?”@@@The answer is peace, equality and prosperity.@@@Every person wants to live in peace, to be free and equal, and to have a decent quality of life.@@@Those are the three themes that I would like to focus on today.@@@All three are equally important, interlinked and go hand in hand.@@@This institution should be focusing on delivering on them through concrete actions rather than words.@@@For far too long, I would say, world leaders have allowed disparities to grow in this world, whether between the rich and the poor; between those who have access to fundamental rights and needs such as health care, water, food, and technology and those who are deprived of even the most basic needs; and between those with different sexual orientations.@@@Peace, equality and prosperity are what we as world leaders should aspire to deliver to our people, to the world and to future generations — that is, if we truly want to make a positive difference in their lives.@@@I want to start by discussing peace.@@@Peace builds, restores and strengthens.@@@Without peace, security and stability, we will never be able to focus on the more important challenge we face, which is bringing about growth, equality and prosperity.@@@That is what Malta and its people stand for.@@@It is what our predecessors had in mind when they enshrined in our Constitution the words “Malta is a neutral State actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations”.@@@That declaration of principles is also echoed in the core values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which we should all be committed to upholding.@@@Today, peace is threatened by what Secretary-General Guterres rightly referred to as the cauldron of crises in which we find ourselves.@@@And if we do not come together to work for a global order and world peace, we do not stand a chance, for no single State can do it alone.@@@In 1989, Malta played an important role in bringing an end to the Cold War by hosting the Bush-Gorbachev summit.@@@Today we remain more committed than ever to contributing to the re-establishment and maintenance of world peace, order and security.@@@As an island State in the Mediterranean, we have seen first-hand the effects of conflicts in our southern area.@@@For more than a decade, those conflicts have led to instability,
with wars and violence causing irreparable harm in Libya, Syria and Yemen, which in turn also led to mass migration.@@@Equally tenuous are the situations in the Sahel, Afghanistan and the Middle East.@@@Naturally, at this moment in time, the most prominent is the war in Ukraine.@@@Following decades of peace in mainland Europe, it is a stark reminder that peace can never be taken for granted.@@@Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions are suffering devastating losses.@@@Close to 12.8 million people are estimated to have been displaced in Ukraine, which is a third of its population and constitutes the largest human displacement crisis in the world today.@@@The international community cannot afford to lose sight of any of these situations.@@@Our sustained support is urgently required to address the humanitarian needs they create and put an end to the devastation in order to end the suffering of innocent civilians.@@@Let us not underestimate the effects of the war.@@@A failure to act will also cause instability to spill over into neighbouring regions with all of its negative consequences, including mass migration, human trafficking and terrorism.@@@Yet as the war rages on in Ukraine, we must not forget the other issues that require our attention and action.@@@I would like to speak briefly about our brothers and sisters in Northern Africa, particularly in Libya — a country that is a neighbour to Malta.@@@Under the auspices of the United Nations and without interference from foreign actors, I believe that Libya and its people can transition to more peaceful, secure, stable and prosperous times.@@@For that to happen, however, decisions must be taken to immediately put aside vested interests in Libya once and for all.@@@That is what the Libyan people deserve and what is best not just for their region but for the Mediterranean area and the African continent in general.@@@We are indeed living in trying times as a result of these wars.@@@Despite our efforts, equality remains a remote concept.@@@Today’s global food supplies and energy markets have been shaken as never before, mostly because of the war in Ukraine.@@@The knock-on effects will be felt by our peoples in different ways.@@@Right now, they are taking the shape of constraints in the purchase of grains, fertilizers, agricultural equipment and livestock feed, shortages of which have inflated the prices of key basic imports.@@@That in turn has negatively affected the purchasing power of consumers around the world.@@@That continuing rise in the rate of inflation on food products, as well as in food scarcity and insecurity, is a major cause for concern and should be at the top of our agenda.@@@Those pressures have an even more intense effect on small islands such as my country, owing to their insularity and other specificities.@@@In Malta’s case, we took a calculated strategic decision to support and stand behind our people all the way to the best of our ability.@@@If we do not support our people until the situation improves, we will have failed them.@@@We cannot leave them to carry the burdens alone.@@@At the same time, we must bear in mind that if the situation is prolonged, it will lead to increased pressures on economic, social and environmental sustainability for us all.@@@It is our duty, as citizens of a global, interconnected world, to work for more sustainable food systems, fulfilling our commitment to achieving zero hunger.@@@But in order to end hunger, we must also end conflict and war.@@@The right to food is a recognized basic human right.@@@The consequences of not acting to safeguard it, compounded with the devastation caused by climate change, will be severe and could lead to famine and the further displacement of peoples.@@@The number of people globally living in poverty is estimated to have risen by more than 70 million so far.@@@With the probability of further marked increases in the coming months, that is something we cannot afford.@@@We appeal for the United Nations to address the global needs for resilience, as a counterpart and counterbalance to the dynamics of globalization and as a matter of urgent priority.@@@In that regard, my country is a firm believer in international fair trade as a key element in the development of nations and something that is particularly important for smaller economies, which are largely dependent on external supply and demand for economic growth and increased social well-being.@@@The pandemic has severely slowed the historical decline in the poverty rate.@@@Food insecurity and price hikes will exacerbate the plight of millions around the world, as the effects of the war in Ukraine could continue to push the number of people at risk of falling below the poverty line even higher.@@@In the twenty-first century we will not find solutions through the use of force or weapons.@@@We can prevent a further deterioration of the situation only if we manage to resolve war through dialogue and meaningful negotiation efforts.@@@The twenty-first century should not be an era of war.@@@The quest for peace requires that all who are parties to conflict put the best interests and priorities of the people first.@@@We all know what the best interests of our peoples are.@@@Our absolute priority should be to re-establish peace and order and to end war.@@@That is what our people are telling us they
want, and it is what they deserve, so that is what we must deliver to them, without any further delay.@@@We have all experienced almost three years of continued crisis, including a pandemic.@@@The most vulnerable in our societies are the ones who have been the hardest hit.@@@Social unrest will increase if our peoples’ quality of life deteriorates.@@@That is why we must intensify our pursuit for peace, equality and justice for all.@@@Malta will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they continue to face an unprovoked aggression.@@@We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians and condemn all tactics and recent statements that do not bode well and will most probably mean a further deterioration of the situation.@@@The third theme I want to delve into is prosperity.@@@Economic resilience is now more important than ever.@@@Only through economic ties and interdependence and the freedom of movement of people and capital across countries can we hope for long-lasting world peace.@@@For decades, globalization has been hailed as the next frontier of economic growth, by enabling human, financial and capital resources to be deployed as effectively as possible; by fostering jobs — or rather, careers — through international trade; by creating wealth through technological advances and their dissemination; and by allowing for better diversification against risk through the creation of multiple investment opportunities.@@@Our time is now, and if not now, when?@@@Let us turn the challenges we face into opportunities to transform our economies and make them future-ready, and to focus on our green objectives.@@@It is imperative that during these trying times we avoid any temptation to put the climate on the back-burner.@@@We should make no mistake — the future is green, and it is digital.@@@I will focus on the latter first.@@@The digital arena is one that Malta has recognized and embraced.@@@We have invested heavily in our digital economy, both in terms of public administration and on the business and social fronts.@@@Today we rank first in the European Union (EU) in terms of e-Government and fifth on the EU Digital Economy and Society Index.@@@That is no coincidence.@@@It is the result of our strategic vision on digitalization.@@@Our priority is always to keep our citizens at the heart of our policies and to strive to improve their quality of life, on multiple levels, by providing excellent, quality services, increasing the number of high-quality jobs, and reducing the digital divide to avoid leaving anyone behind where the use of technology is concerned.@@@Digital is the future, and we are committed to it.@@@In parallel with the digital transition, we have to work on the green one.@@@In both areas, we must continue emphasizing the importance of closing the digital gap across all nations in order to ensure a level playing field.@@@The displacement of peoples due to climate change, particularly as a result of droughts and sea-level rise leading to loss of territory, is unfortunately taking place on our watch.@@@Though no one is safe from climate change, it is those who are most vulnerable who are the worst affected.@@@In Pakistan floods have already claimed thousands of lives.@@@And what about the heatwaves and droughts in China, California, the Middle East, Africa and Asia?@@@What about the cyclones and typhoons in Japan?@@@All of those are climate disasters that happened in 2022 but may become the order of the day if we do not intensify our efforts.@@@There is no quick fix — far from it.@@@Here I must reiterate that global challenges require global solutions.@@@Together, we must keep the 1.5°C target alive, ensure that no one is left behind, and continue working to build decarbonized nations and societies.@@@As my country is about to proudly embark on a two-year term on the Security Council, we intend to do our utmost to keep climate change on the international peace and security agenda.@@@Climate change poses a serious threat to us all, but particularly to small island developing States and many coastal communities.@@@It threatens State sovereignty, leads to loss of territory and damages States’ infrastructure, as well as jeopardizing their existing rights under maritime zone boundaries.@@@As Prime Minister of Malta, I am fully aware of the threat that climate change poses to small island States all over the world.@@@No matter how near to or far we are from one another, we truly share similar climate challenges.@@@Malta was one of the founding members of the Alliance of Small Island States and aims to become a leader in small island State governance.@@@A lot has already been done in recent years.@@@Malta has been channelling overseas development aid for decades now and we are committed to continuing to offer support through scholarships and dedicated learning and training programmes in various areas.@@@One such area is water management.@@@Water scarcity is becoming one of the most serious effects of climate change.@@@Our water-management practices, particularly sourcing water through desalination and wastewater recycling, can serve as a model for addressing our world’s future needs, especially in view of the increasing recurrence of droughts brought about by climate change.@@@Moreover, small States may serve as platforms where innovative ideas and technologies can be tested and eventually identified as international best practices and adopted on a wider scale.@@@Malta launched an initiative for islands at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow last year, and we intend to continue to build on it further.@@@Our aim is to bring to the fore the realities of small island economies as we strive to decarbonize, digitalize and fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Safeguarding our oceans therefore remains one of our key priorities.@@@The interplay between climate change and the health of our ocean is important for Malta as we draw on our maritime legacy and our historical contribution at the United Nations.@@@The ocean plays a pivotal role in combating climate change but is itself also vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and changes in sea temperature and currents.@@@That is why as a member of the Security Council we will place particular emphasis on bridging the gap between science, policy and law-making in order to address global security concerns, especially with regard the ocean, as the single largest habitat on our planet.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to thank members for placing their trust and confidence in my country to serve on the Security Council for a two- year term starting in January 2023.@@@As a proud State member of the European Union, located between two continents, we are committed to promoting dialogue and understanding with a view to strengthening cooperation and social progress.@@@While the challenges we face are many, if we work together and concentrate our efforts I am sure that there are no obstacles we cannot overcome.@@@Through cooperation and exchange, we will be able to see our societies grow and thrive.@@@Now is the time for nations to reach out, deepen ties with existing partners and develop new relationships with others.@@@As a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Security Council starting next year, Malta stands ready to work with other Member States to maintain and encourage international peace and dialogue and to find transformative solutions to today’s challenges by fostering peace, strengthening equality and delivering prosperity, keeping security, sustainability and social justice at the heart of our efforts and priorities.@@@I would like to conclude by conveying a message that my 10-year-old daughter, Giorgia Mae, who is here with us in the audience, asked me to pass on when I explained to her that I would be addressing this meeting of world leaders.@@@She said, “Papa, I would like the world leaders to be an example to us children and leave behind a beautiful Earth”.@@@May that simple yet poignant message enable us to deliver what is expected of us.@@@It is my honour and privilege to once again join and address the General Assembly.@@@On behalf of my Government and my people, I congratulate the President of the Assembly, as well as the Government and the people of Hungary, on his election and wish him the very best.@@@The presidency’s theme of an integrated agenda for peace, prosperity and sustainability through multilateralism is very much needed today.@@@We must build on the good foundations that preceding Presidents and all of us have laid going forward, given the turmoil, uncertainty, mistrust, pain and suffering resulting from multiple crises, including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the worsening climate crisis, the escalating socioeconomic challenges and the conflicts tearing us apart.@@@Let us transform words into actions.@@@That must be underpinned by our collective commitments; supportive resources that are affordable, accessible and timely; and enhanced opportunities that will assist us all in providing for our peoples’ basic needs, while restoring their trust and confidence in all our Governments and healing our lands and ecosystems to deliver the future we want, as envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and many of our own development aspirations.@@@Let me pay tribute to the previous President, a fellow representative of a small island developing State, Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, for his outstanding presidency of hope, which renewed our collective resolve to turn the tide against the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic and other evolving challenges.@@@We wish him all the very best.@@@May I also convey my delegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-General for his continued strong leadership and untiring efforts in rallying the world to save ourselves and provide a much better, safer and more secure future for all, including, most important, for succeeding generations.@@@The candid yet sobering report of the Secretary- General (A/77/1) on the work of the Organization that he presented today (see A/77/PV.4) is deeply troubling.@@@The clarion call of the Secretary-General must not go unheeded.@@@We must all do our part and act decisively now for our collective good; otherwise, the alternative is to condemn ourselves to a future of doom and gloom.@@@Is that what our children deserve?@@@It is with that in mind that Papua New Guinea supports the Secretary-General’s narrative in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We welcome the preliminary progress made towards better understanding the range of defining issues and how we address that effectively to help deliver on the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to improve our peoples’ lives and livelihoods while also better protecting our common environment.@@@In that connection, we applaud the Secretary- General for convening the Transforming Education Summit.@@@We are pleased to note the shared recognition of education as a cornerstone of a prosperous, stable and secure future for all.@@@I know that an educated
society is an informed society that stands to make better decisions.@@@Education is a key priority for my country and is guided by our education policy to leave no child behind, supported by our Education Sector Development Plan 2023-2027.@@@It is a holistic and inclusive approach to ensuring a focus on a quality life-long education for all, with special attention given to the most vulnerable and marginalized population, while recognizing the importance of multi-stakeholder participation in the pursuit of education.@@@One demonstration of that strong commitment to education is my Government’s decision to provide free education for all, up to grade 12 and continuing into tertiary-level education, as well as to provide opportunities for children, young people and adults, through flexible, open and distance education and community colleges, to scale up their capacity to be entrepreneurs and nation-builders.@@@We also welcome the consensus reached on the Summit of the Future, to be held in September 2024, which aims to find solutions to the multiple crises we face on Earth.@@@However, that should not be defined by the lowest common denominator but, in my view, must be more ambitious, yet realistic and workable.@@@We remain committed to engage in that process because it provides an opportunity for us to also draw parallels with our national efforts to attain Papua New Guinea’s Vision 2050.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the COVID-19 pandemic and the other stresses we face as a nation, including supply chain difficulties and development financing challenges, have spurred my Government to embark on our own national process similar to the Secretary-General’s global efforts under Our Common Agenda.@@@We have taken stock of our own domestic development challenges and have put in place key policies and legislative measures, including reforms of important sectors and development priorities, tying them to our budget cycle under the medium-term development plan.@@@That path, if we follow it, will make Papua New Guinea a middle-income country by 2050, in line with the aspirations of our nation’s Vision 2050.@@@I report to the United Nations that the core focus of my Government for the next five years — since we received a mandate in the recently concluded democratic election process — will be to build a resilient and diversified economy; invest in high-quality economic and social infrastructure; ensure fair and equitable natural resource development; address business and investment confidence; strengthen the rule of law and domestic security; deliver quality education and health to all our people; and, last but not least, to strengthen the institutions of State, including governance, on key issues such as corruption and everything that is fundamental to developing nations.@@@Those are the fundamental building blocks of my country, which should contribute towards the achievement of peace, prosperity and sustainable development.@@@As Papua New Guinea approaches the fiftieth anniversary of its independence in three years, my Government has also prioritized the industrialization of our economy through import substitution, value-adding and downstream processing of our vast natural resources through the use of modern green technology that will not compromise my country’s rich biodiversity and our pristine natural environment.@@@Papua New Guinea is documented to have about 5 to 6 per cent of world’s biodiversity and our huge tropical rainforest is third in size only to that of the Congo and the Amazon.@@@We therefore welcome genuine and appropriate foreign investors to partner with us on various sectors of our renewable resource development, and I assure them of fair, equitable and secure returns on their investments.@@@While we note the global community’s calls for domestic revenue sources to be expanded and better harnessed for development financing, we also recognize that the existing global economic and financial architecture is weighted against developing countries such as Papua New Guinea.@@@That structure needs to be changed to better support all developing nations in their development needs.@@@Let us not forget that small developing countries often bear the brunt of global economic and social woes that they have no hand in engendering.@@@In that spirit, I join the calls of fellow small island developing States for their development financing needs to be measured based on the environmental, economic and social dimensions of their vulnerability rather than based on their gross national income measure alone, which is no longer a suitable approach.@@@Accordingly, we urge the international community to support the proposed multidimensional vulnerability index for small island developing States as a tool to support such States through concessional financing and debt relief,
given their special circumstances amid the increasing challenges that they continue to face in meeting their development needs, including food security, as alluded to by the Secretary-General.@@@Today many parts of the world face food insecurity, hunger and poverty, which Papua New Guinea can contribute to alleviating.@@@In response to the Secretary- General’s concerns about global food security, I would like to recall that Papua New Guinea’s 8 million people live on a land mass of 464,840 square kilometres, and that our country has rain and water in abundance, while our seas are equally a food source.@@@For instance, we supply tuna to Asia and Europe.@@@Compared to, for instance, the United Kingdom of Great Britain’s 243,610 square kilometres, Japan’s 377, 975 square kilometres or our neighbour the Philippines’ 300,000 square kilometres, Papua New Guinea has enough land, sea and people to be a food supplier to the world.@@@For the first time in our country, my Government has exerted efforts to address that imminent problem by placing more emphasis on the agricultural sector, which is viewed not only as a revenue source for our economy but also as a conduit to empower the majority of our rural communities, through the introduction of innovative farming methods in cash-crop production, livestock and poultry, in order to allow those communities to take ownership and leadership of their development needs and livelihoods and at the same time foster poverty alleviation and food security.@@@It is from that perspective that we have established new ministerial portfolios for oil palm, coffee and livestock to assist us not only in catering better to the needs of the majority of our rural communities and integrating their local economies into the national and global markets but also in improving lives and livelihoods so that they can be a source of food security and hunger and poverty alleviation for both our country and other countries.@@@We therefore welcome new international development partners that wish to work with us in the agricultural sector, particularly on the downstream processing of products, which adds value and supports local communities and our country.@@@As the world prepares for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and despite the rallying efforts of the global community, including through pledges to cut emission levels under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the world remains on fire.@@@That is further compounded by destructive floods and rising sea levels — allow me to convey Papua New Guinea’s sympathies to the victims of the recent flood in Pakistan — which affect our coastal communities, including through displacement and loss of identity as a people, both in my own country and across the Pacific region and beyond, as carbon emission levels continue their destructive spiral out of control.@@@We cannot and must not allow that to continue.@@@I reiterate the call I made last year in this Hall (see A/76/PV.13).@@@My country, with one of the largest standing pristine tropical rainforests in the world, is one of the few carbon-positive countries in the world.@@@We remove more carbon than we emit.@@@Over the past five years or so, we have reduced national forest emissions by 53 per cent, for a total of more than 75 million tons of United Nations-verified Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) credits, which will be on the market by the end of this year.@@@My Government has updated the Climate Management Act and this year put in place a nationally determined contribution regulation.@@@We now have the legislation in place needed to implement the Paris Agreement.@@@We have also endorsed our nationally determined contributions implementation plan and road maps on electricity, agriculture, forestry and other land use.@@@We are also drafting our first electric vehicle policy and working towards endorsing our national adaptation plan.@@@However, it is disheartening for small countries like Papua New Guinea that do not have a big carbon footprint to note that, despite our proactive national efforts to implement our commitments under the Paris Agreement, we seem to always get the raw end of the deal.@@@We have done our part, yet we have had little support from the global North, including for our submissions to the Green Climate Fund.@@@But we have not lost all hope, even though REDD+ and forest nations were almost forgotten in the conversations held recently in Glasgow.@@@We will no longer be placated by toothless pledges.@@@We need the power of sovereign carbon markets that fully comply with the Paris Agreement.@@@The world cannot talk about climate change without talking about forest conservation and proper land-use management.@@@Papua New Guinea calls for an urgent global focus to be placed on the conservation, preservation and sustainability of our global forests, including proper land-use practices, because it is only in our dear trees
in the forests that one finds the dual benefit of carbon cleansing and oxygen production.@@@I had the privilege of meeting His Majesty King Charles III, and the views on forests that he shared with me are the same as those I have mentioned here today, including the view that the world, especially countries whose carbon footprints on Mother Earth are the greatest, must help preserve the Earth’s forests in a manner commensurate with each country’s emission levels.@@@That is incumbent upon all nations.@@@We must preserve our forests.@@@It is Papua New Guinea’s humble view that the atmospheric balance of oxygen and carbon should be prioritized as the number one focus of all humankind because therein lies the sustenance of life and the dear trees in our forests play a balancing role as created by the Creator God.@@@The world must save its forests; not to do so will be suicide for the Earth’s future.@@@We are leaving a gloomy future for our children.@@@That is something we must correct at the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@Let us not forget that there is more carbon stored in the world’s forests than in all known coal, oil and gas reserves.@@@In short, if we lose our rainforests, climate stability is impossible; we may as well kiss goodbye the temperature goal of 1.5C warming.@@@We and other rainforest nations are trying our best to balance the harvesting of our forests for our development needs with conserving them for the world.@@@We need help with that.@@@The Assembly must hear us.@@@Our planet is fragile and time is short, but together we can do this, and not to do so would be to the detriment of planet Earth.@@@Finally, given the increasing adverse impact of climate change on our communities, I would like to reiterate Papua New Guinea’s strong support for the initiative of our Melanesian neighbour, Vanuatu, to seek an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on that existential threat.@@@We invite others to join Pacific, Caribbean and other partners in taking that initiative forward at the General Assembly for our common good.@@@With regard to the ocean agenda, I reaffirm that Papua New Guinea, as a maritime nation, is strongly committed to ensuring that our maritime zones remain safe, secure and peaceful in the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@Our maritime zone not only provides us with economic opportunities, including through our fisheries resources, but also symbolizes our ties with the ocean over many centuries.@@@Along with other small island developing States and least developed countries, Papua New Guinea calls on developed nations to assist us in accessing appropriate capacity-building resources, research, science, technology and financing to strengthen our national efforts to better protect our oceans and harness the ocean-based economy.@@@Accordingly, we welcome public-private partnerships.@@@With regard to SDG 14, it was pleasing to note the success of the second Ocean Conference.@@@We are encouraged by the welcome offer of France and Costa Rica to co-host the next Conference and look forward to working with like-minded countries to take forward that initiative.@@@Such partnerships on the ocean agenda are most welcome.@@@I would also like to applaud the sterling efforts made\ under the leadership and presidency of Singapore in last month’s negotiations on a new implementing instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, to which as a marine nation we offer our full support.@@@A resounding call that we continue to hear loudly, clearly and repeatedly — and rightly so — is the importance of empowering young people to be at the table as real partners in national development when decisions are being made about their lives and livelihoods.@@@That is indeed long overdue and must be brought to fruition without further delay.@@@In recognition of the ever-increasing youth bulge in my country and the challenges that young people continue to face, youth issues are now front and centre of my Government’s development priorities for nation-building.@@@We are rolling out cadetship programmes as a tool for capacity-building and training that will equip young people to be owners, drivers, leaders and entrepreneurs in building our nation.@@@We are also using our education system as a lever to foster integral human development for all our young people.@@@We welcome development partners to join us in that transformative endeavour.@@@It was in that spirit that Papua New Guinea was pleased to be a main sponsor and strong supporter of the establishment of the Youth Office in the United Nations Secretariat.@@@It was also pleasing to note the consensus on that issue.@@@While we recognize that much more work remains to be done, we look forward to harnessing the
United Nations Youth Office, once it is operationalized, to support our national efforts on the youth agenda.@@@The potential of our young people was well recognized by Deputy Secretary-General Ms. Amina Mohammed and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Youth Employment during their ground-breaking visit to my country in March 2020, which was a testament to that partnership.@@@Gender equality and empowerment, including combating gender-based violence, remains a top priority for my Government.@@@We have established a bipartisan parliamentary committee that has carried out extensive public consultations, and the recommendations made to the previous Parliament will be taken up by the current Parliament in a serious way in order to better address the protection of our women and girls and give them fair and just opportunities to reach their full potential.@@@We have also put in place legislation and policies to address concerns related to gender equality and empowerment and combat gender-based violence.@@@In addition, we are pleased that two well-qualified women were newly elected to the eleventh Parliament — an improvement on the last Parliament, in which there were no women parliamentarians.@@@I have recognized their capabilities and professionalism and have tasked them with specific responsibilities for the country.@@@We will continue to work hard to include more women representatives in decision-making bodies as equal development partners.@@@I would like to join the call for global peace and stability.@@@The simmering tensions and mistrust that are the nemesis of peace cannot and must not be allowed to fester any longer.@@@We, as members of this Organization, took it upon ourselves to uphold the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It is therefore incumbent on all of us to ensure that we are seen to uphold our commitments to the Charter.@@@In the context of the ongoing Bougainville peace process, I want to assure this forum that that important issue remains a top priority in Papua New Guinea.@@@Peace by peaceful means underpins that national priority, and I would like to note that we are on the road to establishing a political solution for Bougainville.@@@We have a road map that continues to serve as a blueprint, and we will consider all issues under the existing parameters of our Constitution for a lasting, peaceful political solution that is acceptable to all Papua New Guineans as far as Bougainville is concerned.@@@We would like to thank United Nations for its role in Papua New Guinea and the Melanesian conflict resolution model, which can be replicated in other countries facing political conflict.@@@With regard to Security Council reform, making that organ relevant to today’s realities is a task to which we must attend.@@@We note the incremental progress that continues to be made in the intergovernmental process.@@@However, let me reiterate our call to expedite the long- drawn-out process by ensuring that we have a negotiated document that can serve as a basis for moving forward.@@@May I also take this opportunity to recognize the milestone achievement made earlier this year, whereby the General Assembly held Security Council members responsible for their decisions on peace and security.@@@We welcomed and supported the emergency special session measures taken by the General Assembly with respect to the situation in Ukraine in order to ensure that the Security Council is held accountable for its actions.@@@The success that arose from that process is a small but nonetheless significant step illustrating why reform of the Security Council is necessary and cannot be delayed further.@@@Last but not least, may I take this opportunity to pay homage to the memory of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who by the grace of God and Lord Jesus was Papua New Guinea’s Head of State for 47 years.@@@Our beloved Queen personified grace, dignity, honesty, humility, tolerance of others, forgiveness and all other Christian virtues and lived a consistent, unfailing life of public service for 70 years — some lessons we leaders of the world must learn to practice.@@@On behalf of Papua New Guinea, I pay my respects to Mama Kwin, as we affectionately called her.@@@May her soul rest in peace with her maker, Jesus.@@@We convey our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to His Majesty King Charles III and his royal family, the people and the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth family.@@@Let me conclude by thanking the President for giving me the opportunity to speak again on a very appropriate contemporary theme and our shared global need, and by thanking the United Nations for once again being a wonderful host at this milestone seventy- seventh session of the Assembly.@@@May God bless the United Nations.@@@At the outset, I would like to sincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi and the friendly State of Hungary on his election as President of the General Assembly.@@@I wish him every success in managing the work of this session, the theme of which is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@I also sincerely congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, representative of Maldives, for his efforts to uphold the purposes and principles of the Organization.@@@I further commend and pay tribute to the role played by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in strengthening the presence of the United Nations amid all those global and intertwined challenges.@@@I would like to thank all United Nations staff, agencies and envoys for their tireless efforts to alleviate the suffering of our Yemeni people.@@@Through their good offices and continued efforts, they have striven to bring peace and stability to my country, which has been drained by eight years of war and major humanitarian crisis caused by the Houthi terrorist militias, supported by the Iranian regime.@@@I take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate our great Yemeni people who, concurrent with this meeting, are celebrating their national days on 26 September, 14 October and 30 November.@@@Those dates represent key milestones of cultural and social development in my country, including the proclamation of the Republican regime in 1962, which is being undermined by the new Imams six decades after the proclamation, which was based on the principles of freedom and justice and the eradication of disparities and racial discrimination, in addition to women’s participation and the guarantee of rights and liberties.@@@It is an honour for me to speak to the Assembly today for the first time as President of the Presidential Leadership Council of the Republic of Yemen.@@@For the eighth year in a row, a Yemeni leader is addressing
the Assembly about the war, destruction and the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.@@@Every year, our leaders come to this edifice to reveal the further suffering and pain of the Yemeni people and to recall the memory of the courageous leaders, women, children, neighbours, friends and work colleagues whom we are losing day after day because of the war, epidemics, illness or hunger.@@@Every year passes without the adoption of a robust position on the Yemeni dossier, while our losses pile up and the militias and terrorist groups become increasingly dangerous in their transnational threats and perpetrate stark violations of human rights that have been the subject of consensus within the Organization for more than 70 years now.@@@I am here today to share with the Assembly once again the story of the great and patient Yemeni people, their struggle and suffering, as well as their questions addressed to all of us.@@@They are asking if we can undertake serious work this time to bring an end to the bloodshed, save lives, defeat extremism and terrorism and protect the will of our people and their legitimate aspirations to recover their State, participate in political life, live a good life and rid themselves of sectarian and religious extremism and hate speech.@@@The international community has consistently held a unified position on the Yemeni issue, and we are proud of and appreciative for that.@@@In the beginning, there was the plan to transfer power based on the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiatives and its implementation mechanism in 2011.@@@Then came the inclusive National Dialogue Conference, which ended in January 2014 and involved all components of the Yemeni society, including the Houthis.@@@That led to a reference document guaranteeing the Yemeni people’s broad participation; meeting their aspirations for democracy, justice, equality in citizenship and women’s broad participation; and preserving the right of vulnerable categories of society and freedom of belief.@@@It culminated with the Security Council meeting that took place in Sana’a in 2013.@@@That dream did not last long after the Houthi terrorist militias turned against the national consensus that arose from the inclusive dialogue.@@@The militias prevented the holding of the popular referendum on the new constitution.@@@They invaded the capital, Sana’a, and other Yemeni cities while hunting down the President of the country and pushing the Government of national consensus to Aden.@@@They tried to assassinate the President and took control of the State institutions.@@@They declared a war on neighbouring countries and the entire world.@@@That is how the destructive war started, which today poses a real threat to the security of the region, in particular international navigation routes and global energy supplies.@@@In the years since, the war has killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people and caused 20 million to suffer from famine.@@@Hundreds of thousands of refugees have had to seek refuge in various countries and continents.@@@There are more than 4 million internally displaced persons living in camps in extreme conditions.@@@The war destroyed the people’s means of subsistence along with our nascent democracy.@@@It also brought epidemics and floods related to climate change, causing death, destruction and the collapse of our protection network and governmental care.@@@That left us with limited capabilities to save lives, given the intransigence of the terrorist militias and their rejection of all efforts to achieve sustainable peace, rebuild our country and realize development.@@@On 7 April, a new era based on partnership and national consensus began in our country with the establishment of the Presidential Leadership Council as the legitimate representative of the Yemeni people and their political will.@@@It was welcomed by our people, the region and the international community.@@@Since it was established, the Presidential Leadership Council has strived to achieve peace, end the human suffering and the lofty goals of restoring the State, ending the coup and reactivating the system of rights and freedoms, along with citizenship equality, enabling women and youth to decide their future, and achieve the desired peace.@@@Over the past six months, the Presidential Leadership Council has worked closely with the Government of political competencies and with our brothers in the alliance that supports the legitimate Government, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and various regional and international partners.@@@Urgently needed reform programmes are being set up to activate our institutions, improve services, curb the collapse of our national currency, and tackle severe inflation and the global food crisis.@@@We have prioritized the rebuilding of our security and military institutions, as well as the judicial branch, which had ceased its functions for about two years.@@@We are working to fight corruption and combat terrorism and organized crime.@@@We are activating law enforcement institutions, realizing justice and protecting public freedoms and social peace.@@@The Presidential Leadership Council stresses its adherence to the peace approach pursuant to the terms of the comprehensive solution of the Yemeni crisis reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism, as well as with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, in particular Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which all ensure lasting peace that will enable the State to recover its exclusive authority, constitutional institutions and republican system.@@@We also declare our full respect for international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the various conventions and treaties adopted and ratified by the Republic of Yemen.@@@We are working closely with the neighbouring countries and establishing constructive partnerships with the United Nations and the international community to ensure peace building and achieve security, stability, prosperity and freedom for all the peoples of the world.@@@Our Presidential Leadership Council is committed to establishing an approach in line with the Charter and tasks of the United Nations, while facilitating the work of its humanitarian agencies, political missions and relevant oversight mechanisms to guarantee the political, economic and social rights of women and to bring an end to child exploitation and recruitment.@@@In our search for peace, we have endured painful experiences with the rebellious Houthi militias since the start of the Yemeni crisis.@@@They have broken all their obligations and commitments, beginning with the peace and partnership agreement upon occupying the capital, Sana’a, in September 2014, followed by the first and second meetings in Geneva, the Kuwait consultations and the Stockholm Agreement, and finally the ongoing truce, during which the legitimate Government lost nearly 300 martyrs and more than 1,000 were injured due to the violations perpetrated by the terrorist militias.@@@In only one week, the humanitarian truce will end.@@@The Presidential Leadership Council reminds the international community that the Government has respected all elements of the truce, namely, launching regular commercial flights to Sana’a airport and facilitating the entry of oil products to Al-Hudaydah ports in an attempt to alleviate the suffering of our people.@@@The Houthi terrorist militias maintain their closure of roads to Ta’iz, which has been besieged for seven years, as well as roads to other provinces.@@@They do not pay the wages of their employees or release prisoners, detainees and abductees.@@@They resort to any excuse to violate the truce and obstruct United Nations and international efforts to extend it in order to achieve the comprehensive peace that we all seek.@@@We want a lasting peace.@@@The truce proved without a doubt that we lack a serious partner who wants peace.@@@The Yemenis are now convinced that it will be difficult to achieve sustained calm without strict deterrence against a sectarian armed group.@@@In that context, we stress the steadfast position of the Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council welcoming the renewal of the truce.@@@However, the renewal must not take place if it is not in the interest of the Yemeni people if it is used to prepare for another round of war or if it undermines our sovereignty.@@@The renewal must not empower the terrorist militias, which threaten not only Yemen but the whole region and the entire world.@@@For us, peace is a strategic choice.@@@There is no doubt about that.@@@We are perfectly aware of the difficulty of leading our country without the involvement of all Yemenis.@@@However, we cannot allow any armed group to enjoy the monopoly of power and law enforcement.@@@That is the foundation of a State that the Yemeni people deserve, like all other peoples of the world.@@@For the terrorist militias, the main issue of establishing peace is related not to their concern for sovereignty, as they claim, but to ensure a place above the State and above the people for their leaders, who claim that they have a divine mandate to govern the people.@@@They export transboundary violence and adopt a hostile approach against peace and coexistence while calling for hatred, infidelity and hostility.@@@I am aware that it is difficult for other States that have long lived in peace and stability to understand that there are human beings who claim to have a divine mandate to rule other human beings in this era.@@@They believe that peace constitutes a mental invasion and a soft war.@@@However, that is one of the common realities among the Houthi terrorist militias, Al-Qaida, Da’esh, Boko Haram and other terrorist organizations throughout the world.@@@The theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly — “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” — first requires establishing clear values for peacebuilding under a stable Government and a strict deterrence to protect the political process and pave its way by all means.@@@However, if we continue to fear that the use of force will undermine attempts to strengthen a precarious calm and that designating that group as terrorists will lead to a humanitarian disaster, then we must look for equally
deterrent alternatives.@@@There is nothing better than the international community’s support for the legitimate Government to ensure that the values of freedom, peace and coexistence prevail.@@@From an academic point of view, diplomacy is based on bringing different points of view closer.@@@We can only implement diplomacy as such in the context of a legitimate regime.@@@Entities that deny the rules of the international system must not be communicated with; otherwise, the principles and the Charter of the Organization will be violated.@@@While the world is not paying enough attention to the suffering of the Yemeni people and their voices calling for freedom and good living and is focused on other hotspots of tension across the world, we have had good brothers on our side and an alliance to support legitimacy, led by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have sacrificed blood and money and taken responsibility for defending a State Member of the United Nations on behalf of the international community.@@@They have also hosted millions of Yemeni refugees, who have been accorded many benefits in those countries, including work, residency, medical care and education.@@@This year, the Presidential Leadership Council and the Government of political competencies have received support in various fields from our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.@@@We also cannot forget to commend the funding, humanitarian and development aid we have received from the United States of America, the European Union and the United Kingdom, in addition to other sincere friends as a support for our just cause.@@@Nevertheless, we are experiencing a wider gap in funding that threatens to close more relief programmes intended to save lives, including in the areas of food and health care.@@@In addition to the need of rapid response from humanitarian organizations, it is also more important to invest in long-term income-generating projects and to channel all funds through the Central Bank in Aden in order to support the national currency and lower prices of basic goods so as to avoid a potential famine.@@@The obstacles imposed by the terrorist militias should not prevent us from shouldering our ethical responsibilities to avoid the imminent spill in the Red Sea of more than 1 million barrels of crude oil contained in the FSO SAFER oil tank for the past five years, which could lead to a destructive environmental disaster that would exceed fourfold the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Pacific Ocean in 1989.@@@On this occasion, we thank all countries and Yemeni businessmen who contributed to the plan of salvaging the FSO SAFER, which the Houthi terrorist militias are using as leverage to exert pressure and make money.@@@We join all countries in seeking to ensure free navigation in international waters and in fighting extremism, terrorism and piracy.@@@We also call for efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iran’s nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and destructive role in the region.@@@We also call on the international community to condemn Iran’s blatant interference in our country’s security and stability.@@@Iran is transforming it to a cross-border platform for threatening activity.@@@Iran must be subjected to sanctions under the resolutions of international legitimacy relevant to the Yemeni dossier.@@@In that context, we call on Member States to commit themselves to the disarmament regime, while confronting Iran’s destabilizing influence in the region and preventing it from providing its militias with military technologies, such as ballistic missiles and drones, that are used to perpetrate acts of terrorism against civilians in our country and countries of the region, including planting millions of internationally banned mines on land and in the sea.@@@Iran also targets international maritime routes, in stark violation of international law.@@@The Republic of Yemen stresses its steadfast position concerning the Palestinian question and achieving peace and a just and comprehensive solution to that question based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative in order to ensure the establishment of an independent State for the Palestinian people.@@@The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines respect for the inherent dignity of each human being with equal rights that constitute the bases of freedom, justice and peace in the world.@@@That is why we always need to prioritize those rights in all tasks of the General Assembly on behalf of tens of thousands of our citizens who are refugees, detainees, kidnapped, disappeared or jailed, including journalists, activists, artists, relief workers and hostages of all ages.@@@Members do not need more evidence to prove the stark violations committed in areas under the control of Houthi terrorist militias as the worst places for public freedom and human rights in the world.@@@I would like to conclude by telling a story.@@@A Yemeni who survived the militias, when asked recently by a medical doctor in Cairo about his date of birth,
answered that he was born two weeks ago, meaning since he left Sana’a and survived the militias.@@@However, he was extremely concerned about his family and friends whom he had left behind.@@@That is why we must delay no further in our collective mission of returning millions of Yemeni people to life, hope and the future that members wish for their dear and dignified populations.@@@I offer my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly.@@@I hope that under your leadership, Sir, the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly will bring together the wisdom of each Member State so as to shape a better world.@@@I also express my deepest respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless devotion as he embarks on his second term.@@@Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are called upon to endeavour to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security.@@@When the freedom of any individual in a nation comes under threat, members of the community must join hands to remove the threat and defend freedom.@@@Likewise, when the freedom of any citizen or nation in the global community is in peril, it is the community of nations that must stand together in solidarity to defend that freedom.@@@Our modern history testifies to the process of our solidarity and unity in safeguarding freedom and pushing our civilization forward.@@@Today, plagued by attempts to alter the status quo by force, nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and systemic violations of human rights, the global community is yet again witnessing the freedom and peace of its citizens put in jeopardy.@@@Such threats to freedom and peace must be overcome through solidarity and fearless commitment to the framework of universal global norms consolidated over the years within the United Nations system.@@@The theme of the General Assembly session this year, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, encapsulates the gravity of the global crisis confronting us, which in turn underscores the solemn role of the United Nations.@@@The first step in our journey to seek answers that will help us through these turbulent times begins with solidarity and deference to the universally accepted global norms, as well as the United Nations system established over past decades.@@@As humankind strives to defend freedom and build lasting peace, the role of the United Nations is indispensable.@@@Genuine freedom is not just being free from shackles but having opportunities to live life to the fullest with dignity.@@@Genuine peace is not an absence of war but the elimination of the conflict and enmity that hold back the shared progress of humankind.@@@Genuine peace also entails building the foundation for greater prosperity.@@@Genuine freedom and peace can turn into reality when we are free from disease and hunger, free from illiteracy and free from want of energy and culture.@@@In that regard, the United Nations has been making great efforts through the Economic and Social Council and UNESCO, among others.@@@However, the Organization is now urged to take on a broader role and responsibility.@@@To tackle the challenges brought on by the pandemic, the United Nations must play a central role in bringing the community of nations together to decisively step up their support for countries with limited fiscal space and technical expertise.@@@In pursuit of the global agenda for decarbonization, countries with leading green technologies must work to unsparingly share new and renewable energy technologies with other countries.@@@In the era of digital sophistication, one of the most urgent tasks for the global community and the United Nations is promoting global cooperation to narrow the digital divide, which exacerbates polarization among nations.@@@Countries at the forefront of digital innovation must offer broader assistance for digital education, technology transfer and investment while the United Nations must redouble its efforts to mobilize support to that end.@@@The Republic of Korea, notwithstanding the recent fiscal consolidation, has scaled up support for those who
are in need with resources secured through expenditure restructuring.@@@At home, we are offering more assistance to socially vulnerable groups.@@@Abroad, we have increased our official development assistance budget.@@@Just as broadening support for socially disadvantaged groups lays the groundwork for sustainable prosperity, support for nations of the world that are facing challenges will make global freedom and peace more sustainable.@@@As a responsible member of the international community, Korea is committed to shouldering its due responsibility and playing its role for the freedom of global citizens and the prosperity of the global community.@@@Korea has accelerated research and development for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) therapeutics and vaccines, pledging $300 million toward the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative and $30 million to the Financial Intermediary Funds of the World Bank, among others, thereby expanding its contributions to building a more robust global health architecture.@@@We are also taking part in negotiations to reach a pandemic accord under the World Health Organization.@@@To ensure a more effective response to future infectious disease outbreaks, Korea will host a ministerial meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda in Seoul this November.@@@In addition, Korea will significantly increase its contribution to the Global Fund, joining forces with our partners in our fight against infectious diseases, including AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.@@@Turning to the issue of climate change, Korea will scale up its green official development assistance, help developing countries transition to a low-carbon future and share its innovative green technologies with all humankind.@@@Over the years, Korea has been transferring and sharing its e-Government digital technology with developing countries and many others.@@@The Korean Government is pushing forward with its plan to transform itself into a digital-platform Government.@@@This is an ambitious initiative to substantially upgrade our democracy, public service and welfare through digital technology.@@@We will continue to more widely share our advanced digital technology and data and will spare no effort in providing support and investing in education.@@@As we seek answers to the global crisis we are facing, the viability of the United Nations system and the universal global norms architecture is now being tested.@@@The crisis confronting us will be resolved only when we stand firmly in solidarity to share the universal value of freedom and work together to uphold and spread our freedom.@@@In that vein, we must more firmly support the system of the United Nations, anchored in a spirit of freedom and solidarity, as well as the normative frameworks that have been universally recognized by the international community.@@@Any attempt to turn away from the United Nations system and universal norms will divide the global community into blocs, further compounding the crisis and turmoil.@@@We must more rigorously identify the nature and roots of the problems that lie before us.@@@The international community must vigorously endeavour to share responsibility and join forces whenever necessary to resolve the challenges we face.@@@Once again, I call on the citizens and leaders of the world to demonstrate resolute and enduring support for the United Nations system and universal global norms as we seek answers in this watershed moment.@@@Mr. Dang Hoang Giang (Viet Nam), Vice-President, took the Chair.@@@The very first mission of the United Nations, after its founding, was to approve the Republic of Korea as the sole, legitimate Government on the Korean peninsula, and to defend the freedom of my country by sending over United Nations forces during the Korean war.@@@Thanks to such efforts by the United Nations, Korea was able to become what it is today.@@@As such, the Republic of Korea will protect and expand the freedom of global citizens and, together with the United Nations, we will fulfil our responsibilities to promote peace and prosperity around the world.@@@It is an honour to return to this Assembly of nations once again as President of my country, a position to which I was re-elected five months ago.@@@I am conscious of time, so I have distributed my full speech, and I will skip over many pages as a courtesy and out of respect for the Assembly.@@@Like almost every country on the planet, Timor- Leste has endured multiple climate change catastrophes, a prolonged dry season followed by floods, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and now the global economic impact of the confrontation between Russia, Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.@@@We had a minimal direct impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and fatalities.@@@More children died of dengue than of COVID-19.@@@But the policies we undertook to prevent the spread of that insidious virus, such as curtailing the free movement of peoples and goods, inevitably affected the livelihoods of rural and urban people across the country.@@@Farmers and traders suffered the most.@@@To protect our children, we closed down schools even though we knew that this decision would have serious detrimental consequences for the hundreds of thousands of children and youth who had to miss school and miss out on the one-meal-a-day programme, which provides a meal for every child in schools across the country.@@@In the very early days of the onset of the pandemic, our health authorities and the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies on the ground scrambled and worked hard, day and night, to prevent the much-feared virus from killing our people.@@@Thanks to the prompt actions taken by the Government, supported by our partners and friends, we avoided a public health crisis.@@@Australia proved to be a true sisterly neighbour, promptly delivering every assistance our fragile health system required.@@@We are deeply grateful for the speedy generous action taken by the Australian Government in deploying medical specialists, ventilators and intubation equipment and in training local staff.@@@When a vaccine became available, Australia provided it beyond our needs, enabling the vaccination of more than 72 per cent of our people, including children, in record time.@@@Government and civil servants, who at times move at a tropical leisurely pace, quickly drafted a COVID-19 prevention and economic recovery strategy, which included cash transfers and food baskets for every low- income household.@@@We are grateful to the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (COVAX) for the initial shipments of vaccines.@@@We are grateful to New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, the European Union, Portugal and the United States for their generous support in kind and cash.@@@In a world plagued with conflicts and man-made catastrophes, from Myanmar to Afghanistan, to Yemen and to Ukraine, Timor-Leste is an oasis of tranquillity.@@@Common criminality is very low; armed robbery is unheard of.@@@We do not have organized crime.@@@Our Catholic majority population — 98 per cent of the population — and their Protestant and Muslim brother and sister communities live side by side in total harmony.@@@Timor-Leste does not have a single case of ethnic or religious-based tension or conflict.@@@In 2023, Timor-Leste will hopefully gain World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, another natural extension of our country’s regional and global economic integration.@@@The accessions to WTO and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are driven by Timor-Leste’s own economic interests, such as the domestic economic reform process, to ensure a healthy enabling environment for foreign direct investment, national investment and the diversification of our economy.@@@ASEAN membership is a strategic imperative, which is as important for Timor-Leste’s stability and prosperity as our country’s peace and prosperity should be to ASEAN.@@@As much as peace and prosperity in our neighbourhood benefits us all, conflicts, threats of conflict and risks originating in one country inevitably affect others.@@@At our independence 20 years ago, we had only 20 medical doctors.@@@Today we have more than 1,200 doctors for a population of 1.5 million.@@@That would not have been possible without Cuban solidarity.@@@At independence 20 years ago, life expectancy was less than 60 years; now a Timorese woman can expect to live beyond 71 years of age.@@@Connectivity will surge in the next three to four years, as Timor-Leste will be linked by several submarine cables to Australia, Indonesia and beyond.@@@As it is, we already have a high percentage of mobile phone and social media users, and we are experimenting with exciting digital and e-government technologies.@@@I wish to now touch upon three matters of profound concern.@@@The first issue is the extremely serious food crisis affecting millions of people in Africa and Asia.@@@I hope that all have carefully read the letter of our esteemed Secretary-General, dated 31 August and addressed to all Heads of State, which provides with clinical precision exact figures on the number of our fellow human beings who are affected — women and children, youth and the elderly, in several African countries, Yemen and Afghanistan.@@@The World Bank’s Food Commodity Price Index, which reached a record high in nominal terms during March and April, increased by 15 per cent between April and May, and is more than 80 per cent higher than it was two years ago.@@@Add to that the recent devastating floods in Pakistan inflicting heartbreaking suffering on over 30 million people.@@@Aid to poorer countries of the South should not be cancelled out to be reallocated to address the refugee crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.@@@In 2015, donor countries reallocated their official development assistance commitments to the North African, Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi refugee crisis flowing into Europe, causing an estimated 15 per cent drop in total aid.@@@The potential for a diversion of aid is even greater now, after $349 billion was estimated as needed for the reconstruction of Ukraine.@@@We must ensure that the Ukrainians are supported, but not at the expense of unity with the many struggling people in other nations.@@@In the aftermath of the 2008-2009 subprime crisis, which had knock-on effects across the globe, hundreds of billions of dollars were quickly mobilized to rescue exposed European and American banks.@@@Draconian fiscal austerity measures in the form of cuts in public expenditure and higher taxes were forced on workers and the middle class in the crisis- affected Western countries.@@@But rarely are we able to inspire the rich to show the same level of compassion and wisdom towards the poorer South.@@@I continue to believe that we are all part of the great human family, yet some seem to feel that we are not really equal or part of that same human family.@@@Part of the world lives in dazzling citadels, while their billions of distant relatives live in poor global neighbourhoods.@@@The Western countries and others started off on high moral ground in confronting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but may end up losing the support of the developing world, which constitutes 80 per cent of the global population, after all.@@@They should pause for a moment to reflect on the glaring contrast in their response to other wars elsewhere, where women and children have died in thousands from conflict and starvation.@@@Our beloved Secretary-General’s cries for help in those situations have not been met with equal compassion in response.@@@And we are now facing a ruinous situation in terms of the rising cost of living for the poor, which has already resulted in riots in Sri Lanka, Peru, Kenya and most recently Haiti.@@@Low-income countries were able to spend only a fraction of the amounts that high-income countries spent on COVID-19 stimulus packages.@@@High-income countries spent 20 per cent of their gross domestic product, middle-income countries, 6 per cent, and low-income countries just 2.5 per cent.@@@As a result, many countries had to increase their debt.@@@Debt levels now limit our ability to protect the weakest and most vulnerable from the effects of rising prices, let alone to increase our efforts to address the climate emergency that threatens our very existence.@@@Since 2015 the number of developing countries in debt distress or at high risk has doubled, to 60 per cent.@@@But equally I want to address our cries for solidarity and fraternity to the billionaires and trillionaires of Asia, Africa and Latin America.@@@There is more liquidity in Asia than in Europe and the United States combined.@@@It is time for the richest families and corporations of the so-called global South to gather at a historic summit, hosted by the Secretary-General, to commit to a vision and plan of action to rid Asia, Africa and Latin America of extreme poverty and child malnutrition, ensure that every poor community has clean water and sanitation, provide vaccines and basic public health services and offer better education facilities and better housing with renewable energy and connectivity for better access to education and business.@@@That can be done by the rich of the global South — all it requires is vision, great heart, courage and the understanding that by investing in the poor of our own countries we are investing in peace.@@@Finally, I want to talk about the situation in Myanmar.@@@The people of Myanmar feel abandoned and betrayed by the so-called international community.@@@They are asking why there is such a stark difference in how they are treated compared with the prompt and extremely generous support for Ukrainian civilians and refugees.@@@They are asking why there is so much sophisticated military support for Ukraine’s resistance, yet such a mute reaction to the war that has been waged on them.@@@The Myanmar conflict is affecting the security and stability of neighbouring countries and may escalate.@@@There has to be dialogue among all involved in the conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar and in other crises around the world.@@@The Tatmadaw cannot claim it is defending itself from external aggression.@@@In the Ukraine conflict, Russia and Ukraine should clear their ports and sea routes and allow a resumption of normal international shipping activities, following the breakthrough in the grain and fertilizer agreements brokered by the Secretary-General.@@@Considering the extremely limited number of credible, neutral global leaders, the Secretary-General and the envoys of his choice should work hard day and night to reach a humanitarian ceasefire agreement and a provisional peace agreement.@@@The ultimate goal should be a comprehensive, permanent peace agreement, but in the short term we must aim for a temporary cessation of troop movements and military action, the opening of humanitarian air and land corridors and zones for unimpeded humanitarian assistance and a resumption of export and import activities.@@@Russia, Ukraine and NATO countries must swallow their pride, review the past policies that have led to this mutual suicide, back away from each other’s borders, let the Ukrainians rebuild their country and their lives and let Russia retreat in security to its borders.@@@E nga Mana, e nga Reo, Rau Rangatira ma kua huihui mai nei i tenei Whare Nui o te Ao.@@@Nga mihi maioha ki a koutou katoa, mai i toku Whenua o@@@Aotearoa.@@@Tuia ki runga, Tuia ki raro, ka Rongo to po ka rongo te ao.@@@No reira, tend koutou katoa.@@@I greet you in te reo Maori, the language of the tangata whenua, or first people, of Aotearoa, New Zealand.@@@I acknowledge the leaders who are here, gathered in person after a long and difficult period.@@@As is tradition in my country, I also acknowledge those who have passed.@@@Loss brings with it a chance for reflection.@@@As leaders, between us, we each represent countries and communities who have lost much in the past few years through famine, severe weather, natural disasters and a pandemic.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was devastating.@@@It took millions of lives.@@@It continues to affect our economies and, with that, the well-being of our people.@@@It set us back in our fight against the crisis of climate change and progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while we looked to the health crisis that was right in front of us.@@@While we enter a period now in which the crisis is subsiding, the lessons cannot.@@@COVID-19 schooled us.@@@It forced us to acknowledge how interconnected and therefore how reliant we are on one another.@@@We move between one another’s countries with increasing ease.@@@We trade our goods and services.@@@When one link in our supply chain is affected, we all are.@@@The lessons of COVID-19 are, in many ways, the same as the lessons of climate change.@@@When crisis is upon us, we cannot and will not solve these issues on our own.@@@The next pandemic will not be prevented by one country’s efforts, but by all of ours.@@@Climate action will only ever be as successful as the least committed country, as they pull down the ambition of the collective.@@@However, I am not suggesting that we rely on the goodwill of others to make progress.@@@We need a dual strategy — one in which we push for collective effort but also use our multilateral tools to make progress.@@@That is why, on pandemic preparedness, we support efforts to develop a new global health legal instrument, strengthened international health regulations and a strong and empowered World Health Organization.@@@It is why we are such advocates of the World Trade Organization and its reform to ensure supply chains remain open and critical goods and services are not subjected to protectionism in times of need.@@@It is why we have worked so hard within the Paris Agreement to see the action we need on climate change, while also doing our bit at home, including by putting a 1.5°C warming limit into law; increasing our nationally determined contribution to 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030; and quadrupling our climate finance commitment.@@@Whether on climate, trade, health crises or seeking peaceful solutions to war and conflict, New Zealand has always been a believer in multilateral tools.@@@We were among the founding members of the United Nations, as Governments of the day recognized that the perils of war would be avoided only through a greater sense of shared responsibility.@@@The basis on which this institution was formed remains as relevant today as it was then.@@@But without reform, we risk irrelevancy.@@@There is perhaps no greater example of that than Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.@@@Let us all be clear: Russia’s war is illegal and immoral.@@@It is a direct attack on the Charter of the United Nations and the international rules-based system and everything that this community should stand for.@@@Putin’s suggestion that Russia could, at any point, deploy further weapons that it has at its disposal reveals the false narrative upon which they have based their invasion.@@@What country that claims to be a liberator threatens to annihilate the very civilians it claims to liberate?@@@The war is based on a lie.@@@But I recognize that, for the people of Ukraine who have lost loved ones, their sense of peace and security and their livelihoods, these are all just words.@@@They need us, as a global community, to ask one simple question: “What if it were us?”@@@Our ability to answer that question with any confidence in the fact that we have the tools as a global community to act swiftly and collectively has been severely undermined.@@@In March, when we most needed the Security Council to act in the defence of international peace and security, it could not.@@@It did not fulfil its mandate because of one permanent member who was willing to abuse its privileged position.@@@That was wrong.@@@We will not give up on the ability of our multilateral institutions to stand up against that illegal war or to take on the many challenges we face.@@@Those institutions are the ballast we need, but it is a ballast that requires modernization fit for the tumultuous waters we all face.@@@That is why New Zealand was pleased to champion the veto initiative.@@@Not only does it provide an opportunity to scrutinize the actions of the permanent member who cast a veto, but the veto initiative also gives the whole United Nations membership a voice where the Security Council has been unable to act.@@@But we continue to call for more than that.@@@For the United Nations to maintain its relevancy and to ensure that it truly is the voice of the breadth of countries it represents, the veto must be abolished, and permanent members must exercise their responsibility for the benefit of international peace and security, rather than the pursuit of national interests.@@@There are other battles that we continue to wage as a nation, including our call for a global response to the use of nuclear weapons.@@@Our history of championing not just the non-proliferation but the prohibition of nuclear weapons is grounded in what we have witnessed, as well as what we have experienced.@@@We are a nation that is both of the Pacific and within it.@@@It was in our region that those weapons of war were tested.@@@Those tests have left a mark on the people, lands and waters of our home.@@@The only way to guarantee our people that they will be safe from the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons is for them not to exist.@@@That is why New Zealand calls on all States that share that conviction to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Some will call such a position naive.@@@Some believe that we are safer as a result of nuclear weapons.@@@In New Zealand, we have never accepted the wisdom of mutually assured destruction.@@@It takes one country to believe that their cause is nobler, their might stronger or their people more willing to be sacrificed.@@@None of us can stand at this rostrum and turn a blind eye to the fact that there are already leaders among us who believe that.@@@Nuclear weapons do not make us safer.@@@There will be those who agree, but believe it is simply too hard to rid ourselves of nuclear weapons at this juncture.@@@There is no question that nuclear disarmament is an enormous challenge, but if given the choice — and we are being given a choice — surely we would choose the challenge of disarmament over the consequences of a failed strategy of weapons-based deterrence.@@@This is why we will continue to advocate for meaningful progress
on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Such progress and consensus was recently blocked by Russia and represented a backwards step in the efforts of nearly every country in the world to make some even limited progress on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.@@@None of that will stop New Zealand’s advocacy.@@@We will remain a strong and passionate advocate for efforts to address the weapons of old, but we will also be an advocate in addressing the weapons that are new.@@@After all, the face of war has changed and, with it, the weapons used.@@@The tools used to challenge the statehood of others are hidden and more complex.@@@Traditional combat, espionage and the threat of nuclear weapons are now accompanied by cyberattacks, prolific disinformation and the manipulation of entire communities and societies.@@@As leaders, we have never treated the weapons of old in the same way as those that have emerged.@@@That is understandable.@@@After all, a bullet takes a life, and a bomb takes out a whole village, while a lie online or from a podium does not.@@@But what if that lie, told repeatedly and across many platforms, prompts, inspires or motivates others to take up arms, threaten the security of others or turn a blind eye to atrocities, or worse, to become complicit in them?@@@What then?@@@This is no longer a hypothetical.@@@The weapons of war have changed, they are upon us and they require the same level of action and activity that we put into the weapons of old.@@@We recognized the threats that the old weapons created.@@@We came together as communities to minimize those threats.@@@We created international rules, norms and expectations.@@@We never saw that as a threat to our individual liberties — rather, it was a preservation of them.@@@The same must apply now as we take on those new challenges.@@@In New Zealand, we deeply value our right to protest.@@@Some of our major social progress has been brought about by hikoi or people power, including becoming the first country in the world to recognize women’s right to vote and movement on major indigenous and human rights issues, to name but a few.@@@Upholding those values in a modern environment translates into protecting a free, secure and open Internet in order to realize all of the opportunities that it presents in the way we communicate, organize and gather.@@@But that does not mean the absence of transparency, expectations or even rules, if we correctly identify what it is we are trying to prevent.@@@Surely we can start with violent extremism and terrorist content online.@@@On 15 March 2019, New Zealand experienced a horrific terrorist attack on its Muslim community.@@@More than 50 people were killed as they prayed.@@@The attack was live-streamed on a popular social media platform in an effort to gain notoriety and to spread hate.@@@At that time, the ability to thwart those goals was limited, and the chances of Government alone being able to resolve that gap was equally challenging.@@@That is why, alongside President Emmanuel Macron of France, we created the Christchurch Call to Action.@@@The Call to Action community has worked together to address terrorism and violent extremist content online.@@@As that important work progresses, we have demonstrated the impact we can have by working together collaboratively.@@@We have improved crisis reactions, stymieing the ability to live-stream attacks and have crisis protocols that kick in to prevent proliferation.@@@We are also focused on prevention and understanding those interactions between online environments and the real world that can lead to radicalization.@@@This week we launched an initiative alongside companies and non-profits to help improve research and understanding of how a person’s online experiences are curated by automated processes.@@@That will also be important in understanding more about misinformation and disinformation online — a challenge that we, as leaders, must address.@@@Sadly, I think it is easy to dismiss this problem as one in the margins.@@@I can certainly understand the desire to leave it to someone else.@@@As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech we value so highly.@@@But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to that challenge, I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it.@@@To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value.@@@After all, how do we successfully end a war if people are led to believe that the reason for its existence is not only legal, but noble?@@@How do we tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists?@@@How do we ensure the human rights of others are upheld, when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology?@@@The weapons may be different, but the goals of those who perpetuate them are often the same: to cause chaos and reduce the ability of others to defend themselves; to disband communities; and to collapse the collective strength of countries that work together.@@@But we have an opportunity here to ensure that those particular weapons of war do not become an established part of warfare.@@@Therefore, we once again come back to the primary tool we have: diplomacy, dialogue and working together on solutions that do not undermine human rights, but that enhance them.@@@For those who have not sought out the Christchurch Call to Action, I ask that they consider it.@@@As with so many of the challenges we face, we will only be as strong as those who do the least.@@@In these times, I am acutely aware of how easy it is to feel disheartened.@@@We are facing many battles on many fronts.@@@But there is cause for optimism, because for every new weapon we face, there is a new tool to overcome it.@@@Every attempt to push the world into chaos is a collective conviction to bring us back to order.@@@We have the means; we just need the collective will.@@@We are meeting at a difficult and dramatic moment.@@@Crises are growing, and the international security situation is deteriorating rapidly.@@@Instead of honest dialogue and compromise, what we have is disinformation, coarse statements and provocations.@@@The West’s policy is undermining trust in international institutions as bodies designed to reconcile different interests, and in international law as a guarantee of fairness and of the protection of the weak against arbitrary acts.@@@We are witnessing negative trends in a concentrated fashion at the United Nations, which arose from the rubble of German fascism and Japanese militarism and was established to promote friendly relations and prevent conflicts among its members.@@@Issues relating to the future world order are being decided today, as any unbiased observer can clearly see.@@@The question is whether that world order will have a single hegemon that forces everyone else to live by its infamous rules, benefiting it alone, or whether we will have a democratic and fair world, free from blackmail and intimidation of anyone deemed undesirable, a world without neo-Nazism and neocolonialism.@@@Russia is resolute in choosing the latter option, and together with our allies, partners and like-minded countries, we call for working to make it a reality.@@@The unipolar model of global development serving the interests of the one per cent, who for centuries fuelled its excessive consumption at the expense of the resources of Asia, Africa and Latin America, is receding into the past.@@@Today, with the emergence of sovereign States that are ready to defend their national interests, an equal, socially oriented and sustainable multipolar architecture is taking shape.@@@However, Washington, and the Western ruling elites that have fully submitted to its rule, view those objective geopolitical processes as a threat to their dominance.@@@The United States and its allies want to stop the march of history.@@@Having at some point declared victory in the Cold War, Washington elevated itself almost to the level of God’s messenger on Earth, free of constraints and with a sacred right to act with impunity wherever and however it wants.@@@Any State could be declared its next target, especially if it has somehow displeased the self-proclaimed masters of the universe.@@@We all remember the wars of aggression that were unleashed far from American shores and on far-fetched pretexts in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of peaceful civilians.@@@Were the West’s legitimate interests really at stake in even one of those countries?@@@Were there bans there on English or other languages of NATO’s member States, or on the Western media or culture?@@@Were Anglo-Saxons declared subhuman and heavy weapons used against them?@@@What became of the United States’ adventurism in the Middle East?@@@Has it improved the human rights situation or the rule of law?@@@Has it stabilized the socioeconomic situation or improved people’s welfare?@@@Name one country where life has changed for the better as a result of Washington’s interference by force.@@@In its attempts to revive a unipolar model under the banner of a rules-based order, the West has established dividing lines everywhere based on the notion of confrontation between blocs and the spirit of “either you are with us or against us”.@@@There is no third option or possibility for compromise.@@@In a continuation of its irrational policy of expanding NATO eastward and bringing NATO’s military infrastructure close to the borders of Russia, the United States now wants to subjugate Asia.@@@At the NATO summit in June in Madrid, the self-proclaimed defensive alliance declared the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions indivisible.@@@Closed frameworks are being created under the banner of Indo-Pacific strategies that undermine the entire open and inclusive regional architecture that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has built over decades.@@@On top of that, it is playing with fire regarding Taiwan, going so far as to promise it military support.@@@The notorious Monroe Doctrine is clearly becoming global in scope.@@@Washington is trying to make the entire world its own backyard.@@@Its tool for coercing those who disagree is illegal unilateral sanctions, which for many years now have been used in violation of the Charter of the United Nations as an instrument of political blackmail.@@@The cynicism of that practice is obvious, since the restrictions affect civilians, preventing their access to basic goods, including medicines, vaccines and food.@@@One such egregious example is the United States’ blockade of Cuba, which has gone on for more than 60 years, and whose lifting an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly has been demanding urgently for decades.@@@The Secretary-General, whose duties include facilitating the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions, should of course give that issue special attention.@@@The Secretary-General also has a special role to play in mobilizing the efforts to overcome the food and energy crises that have resulted from the uncontrolled printing of money in the United States and the European Union (EU) during the pandemic, as well as the EU’s irresponsible and unprofessional actions in the hydrocarbon fuel markets.@@@Defying elementary common sense, Washington and Brussels have compounded the situation by declaring an economic war against Russia, and the result has been higher prices globally for food, fertilizer, oil and gas.@@@We welcomed the Secretary-General’s efforts to help broker the Istanbul agreements of 22 July, but those agreements have to be implemented.@@@So far, most of the ships carrying Ukrainian grain have not been directed to the poorest countries, and the financial and logistical obstacles to Russia’s exports of grain and fertilizer imposed by the United States and the EU have not been completely removed.@@@We have pointing out for weeks that 300,000 tonnes of fertilizer are being held up in European ports and have proposed shipping them free of charge to the African countries that need them, but the European Union has not responded.@@@Official Russophobia in the West has taken on unprecedented and grotesque dimensions, with some unhesitatingly declaring their intention not just to defeat Russia militarily but to destroy and dismember it — in other words, to wipe off the world map a geopolitical entity that has become too independent.@@@How have Russia’s actions over the past decades actually encroached on its opponents’ interests?@@@Could it be that they cannot forgive the fact that Russia’s position made the military and strategic detente of the 1980s and ’90s possible?@@@Or is it that we voluntarily dissolved the Warsaw Treaty Organization, thereby depriving NATO of its raison d’etre?@@@Or that contrary to positions in London and Paris, we supported German reunification unconditionally?@@@Or withdrew our armed forces from Europe, Asia and Latin America, and recognized the independence of the former Soviet republics?@@@Or believed Western leaders’ promises that they would not expand NATO eastward by an inch, and when the process started, we agreed to basically legitimize it by signing a Founding Act between Russia and NATO?@@@Did we perhaps encroach on the West’s interests when we warned that bringing its military infrastructure closer to our borders was unacceptable?
Western arrogance and American exceptionalism became especially destructive after the end of the Cold War.@@@As long ago as 1991, Paul Wolfowitz, then the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, in a conversation with NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley Clark, acknowledged openly that
“[wjith the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity....@@@And we’ve got five, maybe ten, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us.”@@@I am sure that one day we will learn from someone’s memoirs how the United States built its policy on Ukraine, but Washington’s plans are already obvious even now.@@@Could it be that they simply cannot forgive us that at the request of the United States and the European Union we supported the agreement reached between the-then President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, and the opposition on resolving the crisis of February 2014, which was guaranteed by Germany, France and Poland — and was then trampled on the next morning by the ringleaders of the bloody coup, humiliating the European mediators?@@@The West simply threw up its hands and looked on in silence as the putschists began bombing eastern Ukraine, where people refused to accept the results of the coup, just as they did when its organizers elevated the Nazi accomplices who took part in the brutal ethnic cleansing of Russians, Poles and Jews during the Second World War to the rank of national heroes.@@@Were we supposed to stand idly by in the face of Kyiv’s policies imposing a total ban on the Russian language and on Russian education, media and culture, demanding that Russians be expelled from Crimea and declaring war on the Donbas — whose residents the Kyiv authorities, then and now, in the words of their most senior officials, have pronounced to be not people but mere creatures?@@@Perhaps Russia was interfering with Western interests when it played a key role in stopping the hostilities unleashed by Kyiv’s neo-Nazis in eastern Ukraine and then insisted on the implementation of the Minsk package of measures — which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in February 2015 but then killed by Kyiv with the direct involvement of the United States and the EU?@@@For many years we have repeatedly offered to agree on the rules for coexistence in Europe based on the principles of equal and indivisible security, as affirmed at the highest level in documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.@@@According to those principles, no country can seek to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others.@@@The last time we proposed making those essential agreements legally binding was in December 2021 and we were met with an arrogant rejection.@@@The Western countries’ unwillingness to engage in talks and the Kyiv regime’s continuing war on its own people left us with no choice but to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics and launch a special military operation to protect the Russian and other residents of Donbas and eliminate the threats to our security that NATO has been consistently creating in Ukraine on what amounts to our borders.@@@The operation is being carried out in accordance with the treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance reached between Russia and those republics on the basis of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@I am certain that any self-respecting sovereign State conscious of its responsibility to its own people would have done the same in our place.@@@The West is having hysterics over the referendums in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya oblasts of Ukraine, but the people there are merely responding to the Kyiv regime’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in an interview in August 2021 advised all who considered themselves Russian to leave for Russia for their children and grandchildren’s sake.@@@That is what the residents of those regions are doing now, and they are taking the lands where their forefathers lived for centuries with them.@@@It is very clear to any unbiased observer that for the Anglo-Saxons, who have completely subjugated Europe, Ukraine is merely expendable material in their fight against Russia.@@@NATO has declared that our country poses an immediate threat to the United States’ quest for total dominance and that China is a long-term strategic challenge.@@@At the same time, the collective West, led by Washington, is sending an intimidating message to every other country, without exception, to the effect that anyone who dares to disobey may be next.@@@One of the consequences of the crusade that the West has declared against regimes it does not favour is that multilateral institutions are declining at an ever-increasing pace as the United States and its allies turn them into tools for realizing their own selfish interests.@@@That approach is being embedded in the United Nations, the Human Rights Council, UNESCO and other multilateral associations.@@@The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been virtually privatized.@@@There are fierce attempts being made to undermine efforts to set up a mechanism within the Biological Weapons Convention to ensure the transparency of the hundreds of military biological programmes that the Pentagon has around the world, including along Russia’s borders and throughout Eurasia.@@@Irrefutable evidence discovered on Ukrainian territory has shown that they are far from harmless.@@@We are seeing a huge policy aimed at privatizing the United Nations Secretariat and introducing a neo-liberal discourse into its work that ignores the cultural and civilizational diversity of today’s world.@@@In that connection, as the Charter requires, we call for attention to be paid to ensuring the equitable geographic representation of Member States within the structures of the Secretariat so that no one single group of countries can dominate it.@@@An intolerable situation has developed around Washington’s failure to meet its obligations, as the host country, under the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, to provide normal conditions for the participation of all Member States in the work of the United Nations.@@@The Secretary-General has corresponding obligations under the Agreement, and any failure to act on them is unacceptable.@@@Various countries’ efforts to undermine the prerogatives of the Security Council are of course a matter of concern.@@@There is no question that the Council, and the United Nations in general, should adapt to current realities.@@@We see opportunities for making the work of the Security Council more democratic but only — and I want to stress this — by expanding the representation of the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.@@@India and Brazil are particularly notable as key international players and worthy candidates for permanent membership in the Council, as long as Africa’s presence is enhanced at the same time.@@@Today it is more important than ever that Member States unambiguously reaffirm their clearly stated commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter as a first and essential step towards restoring their collective responsibility for the fate of humankind.@@@That was the precise purpose of the establishment, in July 2021, of the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations, which was co-founded by Russia and already includes a couple of dozen countries.@@@The group aims to ensure strict compliance with the universal norms of international law as a counterweight to pernicious unilateral approaches.@@@We urge everyone who shares that position to join.@@@In that context, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as well as the BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN have considerable positive potential.@@@Despite their aggressive imposition of their understanding of democracy as a model for the social organization of all countries, our Western colleagues are categorically unwilling to be ruled by the norms of democracy in international affairs.@@@The situation with Ukraine is a very recent example of that.@@@Russia has expounded the basis for its position in detail for the past several years, and the West has expressed its disagreement with it.@@@It should then be up to the other members of the international community to decide what position to take and whether to support one side or the other or remain neutral.@@@That is usually what is done in democracies when opposing politicians make their case to try to win popular support.@@@But the United States and its allies give no one the freedom to choose.@@@They threaten and arm-twist anyone who dares to think independently.@@@They use threats to force others to join sanctions against Russia.@@@That has not worked very well for them, but it is obvious that these kinds of actions by the United States and its satellites are a far cry from democracy.@@@They amount to a dictatorship, pure and simple, or at least an attempt to impose it.@@@We get a strong impression that Washington and its servant Europe are trying to preserve their vanishing hegemony through exclusively forbidden means.@@@Illegal sanctions are routinely used instead of diplomatic methods against strong competitors, whether in economics, sports, the information space, cultural exchanges or general interactions among people.@@@Indeed, the problems that representatives have encountered in obtaining visas for international events in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris also constitute attempts to eliminate competition and insulate multilateral discussions from alternative points of view.@@@I believe firmly in the importance of defending the United Nations and ridding it of anything confrontational or alien so that we can restore its reputation as a platform for honest discussions aimed at balancing the interests of all Member States.@@@That is the approach that guides us in our efforts to promote our national initiatives within the United Nations.@@@It will be vital to achieve a comprehensive ban on the placement of weapons in outer space, which is the aim of the Russian-Chinese draft international treaty now under review in the Conference on Disarmament.@@@Defending cyberspace deserves special attention, including the negotiation of an agreement within the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 2021-2025, as well as drafting a universal convention within the Special Committee on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes.@@@We will continue supporting the Office of Counter-Terrorism and the other counterterrorist entities within the United Nations.@@@We will also continue to help promote dynamic ties between the United Nations and the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Eurasian Economic Union in order to coordinate our efforts across greater Eurasia.@@@Russia calls for stepping up efforts to settle regional conflicts.@@@We believe we should prioritize overcoming the impasse in establishing an independent Palestinian State, restoring statehood in Iraq and Libya, which has been destroyed by NATO’s aggression, neutralizing the threats to Syria’s sovereignty, establishing a sustainable process of national reconciliation in Yemen and tackling NATO’s devastating legacy in Afghanistan.@@@We are working to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear programme in its original form, and to bring about a just and comprehensive resolution of the problems on the Korean peninsula.@@@The multiple conflicts in Africa demand that we resist the temptation to play a geopolitical zero-sum game there and instead consolidate external players in support of the African Union’s initiatives.@@@We are concerned about the situations in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the United States and the EU are stubbornly seeking to undo the international legal framework set forth in Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the Dayton Peace Agreement.@@@In times of change, people tend to rely on and find solace in the wisdom of predecessors who endured similarly challenging hardships.@@@The former Secretary- General Dag Hammarskjold, recalling the horrors of the Second World War, said that “[t]he United Nations was not created in order to bring us to heaven, but in order to save us from hell.”@@@Those words have never been more relevant.@@@They call on all of us to assume our individual and collective responsibility to create the conditions needed to ensure that succeeding generations develop in safety and harmony.@@@For that to happen, everyone will have to demonstrate political will.@@@We are ready to work in good faith and strongly believe that the only way to ensure the stability of the world order is through a return to the roots of United Nations diplomacy on the basis of the key principle of true democracy, which is respect for the sovereign equality of States.@@@I have the great honour to convey the warm regards of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin@@@Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, to this year’s session of the General Assembly.@@@At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba@@@Korosi on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@We also convey our deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his contribution and efforts in bringing multilateralism, which is an important and fundamental principle of our work at the United Nations, to the forefront during his presidency.@@@While it is good to be back in New York to deliver Brunei’s statement in person after a two-year absence, this year’s debate continues to take place amidst global uncertainties and challenges that test our individual and collective resilience.@@@It has been almost three years since we first heard of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and whilst we are still feeling its effects, many of us are now looking towards a post-pandemic world.@@@However, a key and crucial factor to achieving this would be a successful vaccination programme and by having vaccine equity.@@@Let us not forget the mantra of the World Health Organization (WHO) that “No one is safe until everyone is safe”.@@@Unfortunately, as of June this year, only 58 out of 194 countries had achieved the 70 per cent complete vaccination target set by WHO, whilst the others have not.@@@Although initial the challenges faced regarding the supply and manufacture of vaccines that resulted in delays have been addressed, we continue to see many countries still facing problems in getting their allocated vaccines.@@@While we recognize the role that the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility has played in this global health emergency, we also see the continued need to address the fundamental issue of vaccine inequity that has continued to impede supply and distribution.@@@In this regard, we need to develop a more effective and more resilient global health infrastructure as part of our preparedness to face possible future global health emergencies.@@@More efforts are also needed to address the impact of the pandemic, especially on mental health, a condition that was often taken lightly even before the pandemic.@@@This is important, as it can result in a huge economic burden on the countries concerned in the future.@@@We in Brunei Darussalam have come to recognize the need to include this in our post-pandemic recovery efforts.@@@As such, we have introduced a five-year Multisectoral Mental Health Action Plan.@@@In addition, we are also working on a regional basis in East Asia in promoting better mental health and well-being.@@@Climate change is yet another challenge the world was facing even prior to the pandemic, and it is one that continues to be a real and existential threat today and that, if left unaddressed, could lead to another global emergency.@@@In 2015, the world came together on two landmark agreements, namely, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which sets a target to limit global warming by 1.5°C and global greenhouse-gas emissions; as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is aimed at, among other things, to achieve zero hunger.@@@I believe that those two are interlinked and interconnected aspirations.@@@And yet, as we reach the halfway mark towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we see the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showing that the impacts of climate change on agriculture have had devastating consequences on food production and food security.@@@Furthermore, the recent report The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022, issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, WHO and others, has shown that by 2030 the progress made in alleviating world hunger since 2015 will be nullified unless something drastic is done.@@@That is why we must hasten our efforts and remain steadfast in our commitments.@@@To that end, Brunei Darussalam is committed to the climate ambition and is moving towards net zero by 2050, through forest preservation and transition to clean energy, to shape a low carbon and climate resilient future.@@@With 72 per cent of our total land area still covered by rainforests, our greenhouse-gas emissions only accounts for 0.017 per cent that of global total.@@@As one of the regional champions for conservation, environment and forest preservation, Brunei is also playing a leading role regionally by hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Centre for Climate Change.@@@It will function as an intergovernmental centre for climate change coordination and cooperation.@@@It will also strengthen the region’s capabilities to prevent, mitigate, and manage climate-related disasters through established mechanisms and the formulation of policies.@@@We appreciate the contributions made thus far from our partners and friends in this initiative and continue to welcome others to come on board.@@@The United Nations is the foremost multilateral institution, and its Member States therefore have a responsibility to uphold international law and adhere to the founding principles of the Organization, specifically those respecting the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all Members.@@@The maintenance of international peace and security is of utmost importance, and that is no different in South-East Asia.@@@Last year, our region’s peace and stability were affected, and ASEAN collectively agreed on a five-point consensus to work gradually and constructively towards a peaceful solution and eventual return to normalcy in one of our fellow member States, namely, Myanmar.@@@Unfortunately, matters continue to require close attention, and as such we appreciate the continued support and contributions of the United Nations and others in ASEAN’s efforts.@@@On a similar note, the current conflict in Europe has also raised global concern, leading Member States to unanimously adopt a resolution that ensures accountability of the Security Council.@@@It is, however, disappointing that the same attention and regard have not been given to resolving other areas of conflict, particularly on the question of Palestine.@@@We need to ensure that the same amount of attention and consideration are given to conflicts wherever they are, particularly where territorial integrity and sovereignty have been violated.@@@Therefore, the international community must remain resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the two-State solution towards achieving an independent State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@In conclusion, let me say that as we continue to address the concerns of the world in pre- and postcrisis terms, it is clear what this watershed moment in our collective history is.@@@It should not deepen divisions among us.@@@It should not entrench us in our differences, and it should not lead us to serve only ourselves.@@@However, it should, in these final years of the SDGs, make us come together and uphold the spirit of multilateralism that will transform us into a better and more resilient United Nations.@@@I am pleased to extend to you, Sir, and to the representatives of nations gathered here the warm greetings of Pope Francis.@@@It is good to be together again in person.@@@Last year, I spoke of the dark clouds hanging over humankind; while some of those have lifted, other, darker clouds have gathered.@@@Armed conflicts currently afflict our world to an extent not seen since 1945.@@@In addition to the misery caused by violence and cruelty and the anxiety arising from the threat of nuclear escalation, our world continues to face the challenges of climate change, mixed migration and the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic, while food insecurity and water scarcity now affect large portions of the global population.@@@No one can deny that the great challenges of our time are all global.@@@At the same time, alongside the greater interconnection of problems, we are seeing a growing fragmentation of solutions that only fuels further tensions and divisions, as well as a generalized feeling of uncertainty and instability.@@@We need to recover our sense of shared identity as a single human family.@@@If we do not focus on what unites us, seeking to promote the common good, there will only be growing isolation, marked by a reciprocal rejection and refusal that endangers multilateralism.@@@Indeed, here, at the United Nations, we are called to work together to restore, as Pope Francis has requested, that “diplomatic style that has characterized international relations from the end of the Second World War”, making sure it is best able to implement its foundational charter and respond to the challenges faced by humankind.@@@When Pope Saint Paul VI visited this Hall, his heartfelt plea for no more war was broadcast around the world.@@@Decades later, the hard-fought progress in reducing the prevalence of armed conflict globally has been called into question.@@@This reversal deeply concerns the Holy See.@@@Pope Francis has recognized that “we never learn” and that “unfortunately, the old story of competition between the greater Powers” continue, seeking to extend economic, ideological and military influence.@@@And yet, the Holy See strongly believes in multilateralism and the irreplaceable role of the United Nations.@@@For that reason, Pope Francis speaks repeatedly in support of the Organization, encouraging a process of renewal.@@@The General Assembly has been working on the revitalization of various aspects of its work for some time.@@@This process takes place against the backdrop of a crisis of credibility arising not only from its apparent impotence in times of crisis, but also from the promotion of agenda in many forums that frequently shift the focus to matters that, by their divisive nature, do not strictly belong to the aims of the Organization.@@@Pope Francis has called this “ideological colonization”.@@@Unfortunately, key decisions are now frequently made without a genuine process of negotiation in which all countries have a say.@@@This is at odds with the true nature of multilateral diplomacy.@@@Unfortunately, international cooperation is hindered by the flagrant imposition of contentious policies that do not enjoy agreement, particularly in the area of human rights.@@@In that regard, there appears to be little desire on the part of specific States to recover consensus and authentic dialogue.@@@Indeed, today it would appear that only the powerful and the well-funded prevail, reinventing human rights as they see fit.@@@Instead, the fundamental human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are firmly rooted in universal values, such that the right to life, freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression, and that the institution of the family are protected.@@@The Holy See reaffirms that human rights remain universal, objective and firmly rooted in the God-given dignity of the human person.@@@It is imperative that broad agreement and genuine consensus be found again soon within the Organization if it is to restore its international credibility as a true family of nations.@@@It must extend beyond the General Assembly, to the reform of those organs with effective executive capability, such as the Security Council.@@@The landmark resolution 76/262, requiring that the use of veto power be explained before the General Assembly, was a welcome step in that direction.@@@The members of the Security Council, most especially the permanent members, have a crucial responsibility for the maintenance of peace and order in the world.@@@When there is no shared vision or political will for peaceful coexistence, they become themselves the perpetrators of grave injustices.@@@Only when the representatives of nations gathered here are able to place the common good above their own partisan interests will the legal framework of the United Nations system truly be the pledge of a secure and happy future.@@@At present, however, violence continues to scar our world; the devastation that war wreaks directly upon the populations of conflict zones is compounded by the indirect impact on countless other people far from the frontline.@@@As Pope Francis has pointed out,
“war diverts attention and resources, but these are
the objectives that demand the utmost commitment:
the fight against hunger, health, and education”.@@@World hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms are alarmingly on the rise.@@@The number of
people suffering hunger in the world rose to as many as 828 million in 2021.@@@However, expenditure on arms, today at obscene levels, only serves to increase food insecurity, restrict access to health care and deprive generations of their rightful education.@@@It is time to bring an end to armament hypocrisy — speaking of peace and living off weapons.@@@Instead of squandering vast sums on military equipment, it would be far wiser to invest in avoiding war, rather than preparing for it.@@@The war in Ukraine has exacerbated already concerning global trends, including rising food and fuel prices and increased displacement.@@@The conflict has also brought renewed attention to nuclear security and the risk of nuclear escalation.@@@With the onset of conflict, a key source of staple grains and cooking oil for countries that rely on food imports was interrupted, placing millions more at risk of food insecurity and starvation.@@@Additionally, the war has also exposed the vulnerability of short-sighted energy policies that rely exclusively on the single source of fossil fuel, rather than developing clean and sustainable alternatives.@@@It is the poorest among us who suffer the most.@@@Addressing these crises requires urgent and concerted action.@@@Furthermore, the war in Ukraine not only undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime, but also presents us with the danger of nuclear devastation, through either escalation or accident.@@@Any threat of nuclear weapons use is repugnant and merits unequivocal condemnation.@@@In the meantime, Europe’s largest refugee crisis since the Second World War only adds to the millions of refugees throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia.@@@Mixed migration is a global phenomenon that needs to be addressed accordingly.@@@In that regard, implementing the vision and objectives of both the Global Compact for Safe, Regular and Orderly Migration, as well as the Global Compact on Refugees, remains among the best ways to encourage international cooperation and burden-sharing.@@@States must continue to make every effort to generate the necessary conditions for people to live in peace, security and dignity in their countries of origin.@@@Our common home continues to be gravely affected by the adverse impacts of climate change.@@@Indeed, we have grown so used to hearing of extreme weather events, and yet those phenomena are clear signs of our failure to address climate change.@@@Moreover, multilateral environmental agreements have already laid out obligations for States parties that would prove effective in tackling the threat posed by climate change.@@@In that regard, when the international community gathers at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm El Sheikh, it is to be hoped that there will be the political will to take more decisive and transformative decisions to protect the environment by accelerating global climate action through stronger mitigation measures, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance.@@@On this issue, I am pleased to note that the Holy See, acting in the name and on behalf of the Vatican City State, recently deposited its instruments of accession both to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to contribute to the efforts of all States to work together to respond effectively to challenges posed by climate change.@@@The digital environment also demands greater attention, given the increasingly important role that information and communication technologies play in our daily lives.@@@Pope Francis points out that
“the potential of digital technology is enormous, yet the possible negative impact of its abuse in the area of human trafficking, the planning of terrorist activities, the spread of hatred and extremism, the manipulation of information and ... in the area of child abuse, is equally significant.@@@Public opinion and lawmakers are finally coming to realize this.”@@@This is the logic of the appeal of Pope Francis to work together for peace, “not a peace based on the balance of weapons, [or] on mutual fear,” but rather one born of encounter and dialogue.@@@For this,
“it is necessary to pass from the strategies of political, economic and military power to a plan for global peace: no to a world divided among conflicting powers; yes to a world united among peoples and civilizations that respect each other”.@@@At the outset, I have the honour to convey the greetings and wishes of peace and prosperity to the peoples of all countries from the President of Turkmenistan, His Excellency Mr. Serdar Berdimuhamedov.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and wish him success in that important and responsible post.@@@I express my gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his effective work in this position.@@@Turkmenistan sees the current session of the General Assembly from the point of view of the need to urgently leverage the potential of the world community and the United Nations constructive influence on global processes, the search for channels of dialogue as the only acceptable way to resolve conflicts and contradictions, lay down the foundations for developing responsible joint approaches to the problems of postpandemic development, and restore economic and humanitarian ties.@@@For Turkmenistan, the new political year marks an important date — the thirtieth anniversary of its membership of the United Nations.@@@Based on the solid foundation of engagement with this world Organization that we built over the years, and reaffirming our commitment to a strategic partnership with the United Nations and our conviction that there is no alternative to the only world structure with universal legitimacy, Turkmenistan will pursue its efforts to enhance and strengthen its role in the world and reaffirm internationally recognized legal norms and the Charter of the United Nations as the political and ideological bases of intergovernmental relations.@@@The global security architecture created within the framework of our Organization is now being seriously tested.@@@We are witnessing complex processes that hinder multilateral cooperation, including in such important areas as security and stability.@@@In order to overcome the current difficulties in international relations, Turkmenistan considers it necessary to strengthen existing platforms for dialogue and to consider establishing new ones for intergovernmental contact and negotiations on pressing issues on the global agenda.@@@Restoring trust and a culture of respectful dialogue is gaining universal significance as one of the key conditions for a responsible, non-confrontational approach, seeking opportunities for mutual understanding and maintaining a balance of interests when considering problematic issues.@@@In order to further promote the philosophy of trust-based dialogue in international relations, Turkmenistan intends to propose a draft resolution on dialogue as a guarantor of peace for the General Assembly’s consideration.@@@We are convinced that the adoption of such a document would confirm the principled and unequivocal commitment of all United Nations Member States to a peaceful, negotiation-based method of resolving conflict situations, no matter how difficult they might seem.@@@Building further on our efforts in that direction, we invite the international community to declare 2025 the year of peace and trust, based on the provisions of resolution 73/338, adopted at the initiative of Turkmenistan.@@@Today the role of peacekeeping instruments in the international community’s toolkit is objectively increasing.@@@That includes in particular using the potential of neutrality and its conceptual foundations to strengthen overall stability and security.@@@Based on the recognition by the General Assembly of neutrality as a factor in strengthening comp peace and security and resolution 71/275, proclaiming 12 December International Day of Neutrality, Turkmenistan will continue to work actively with partners to expand the membership of the United Nations Group of Friends of Neutrality for Peace, Security and Sustainable Development.@@@The logic of the development of global processes in the field of security dictates the need for a radical strengthening of the mechanisms of regional interaction.@@@On 28 July, the General Assembly adopted resolution 76/299, proclaiming Central Asia a zone of peace, trust and cooperation.@@@We are grateful to the international community for that decision, which creates the necessary conditions in a strategically important part of the political map of the world for carrying out active efforts to strengthen international security, prevent and resolve conflicts, and build strong and effective regional institutions to that end.@@@As the host country of the headquarters of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, Turkmenistan urges the provision of all possible assistance to its work, which has proven its effectiveness.@@@Given that December 2022 will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the establishment of the Regional Centre, we intend to submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on the role of the Centre, reflecting the significant events of recent years and consolidating the mechanisms of regional interaction built on its basis.@@@We are particularly concerned about the currently rise in threats to global food security, which are rapidly beginning to affect an increasing number of countries and entire regions.@@@In these conditions, urgent efforts and effective measures are required of the entire world community to overcome the current situation.@@@In order to maintain the stability of the global food market, to jointly search for solutions to the complex problems of providing food to the most vulnerable countries, and to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to that end, we propose to hold an international forum on food security in Turkmenistan.@@@In the current context, it is especially important to fully deliver on the agreements reached on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) .@@@In that regard, in support of the multilateral tools for monitoring the achievement of the SDGs, Turkmenistan will submit its second voluntary national review on the implementation of the SDGs during the High-level Political Forum in 2023.@@@At present, meeting the challenge of sustainable development will largely depend on the level of international cooperation in such critical areas as transport and energy.@@@Pursuing its efforts to promote multilateral transport cooperation, at the current session Turkmenistan intends to summarize the results of the 2016 and 2021 United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conferences and other high-level transport forums held in recent years, including the Ministerial Transportation Conference of Landlocked Developing Countries, held in Turkmenistan on 15 and 16 August, and to prepare proposals for the development of a draft concept for a special interregional United Nations programme for transport development.@@@At the current session, Turkmenistan also counts on the logical continuation of a broad dialogue on the problem of energy security.@@@In that context, we consider it necessary, based on the provisions of General Assembly resolutions on the reliability and stability of energy resource supplies to world markets, adopted at the initiative of our country, to continue working on the implementation of Turkmenistan’s earlier proposals on the establishment of an international open-ended expert group to develop a modern international legal United Nations toolkit to regulate sustainable and reliable energy transit.@@@In Central Asia, due to objective reasons, climate change and water issues are of critical importance and, in some cases, determining factors in the development of regional processes, with a significant impact on the general situation, the implementation of socioeconomic development plans and efforts to address serious environmental issues.@@@Based on the positions of Turkmenistan on climate change adaptation and mitigation, presented in November 2021 at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow, as well as those practically considered in multilateral consultations within the framework of the Bonn Climate Change Conference in Bonn in June, Turkmenistan is conducting preparatory work for the establishment in Ashgabat of a regional centre for climate technology for the countries of Central Asia.@@@At the same time, noting the nationally determined contribution of Turkmenistan, adopted in May 2022 in the context of fulfilling its obligations under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Turkmenistan intends to step up its efforts to achieve the goals outlined in that document, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of the Global Methane Pledge initiative.@@@We will make persistent and determined efforts to single out the Aral Sea problem a dedicated area of work within the United Nations.@@@To that end, in May 2023 we intend to resume negotiations on a draft resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific on the establishment of a special United Nations programme for the Aral Sea basin, which will be based on the provisions of resolutions 72/273 and 73/297, on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, adopted in 2018 and 2019, respectively.@@@The impact of the pandemic requires us to pursue our coordinated efforts to address identified vulnerabilities in global and national health systems.@@@Turkmenistan will continue to support the joint activities of the international community to combat the novel coronavirus infection and create tools for medical diplomacy.@@@Emphasizing the key role of the World Health Organization in developing consolidated responses to common challenges, we support the global One Health concept and will promote it as part of the Roadmap for Health and Well-Being in Central Asia 2022-2025.@@@Despite the diversity of the challenges facing each of our countries, we are united by common hopes, anxieties and threats.@@@Turkmenistan is ready, together with its partners, to seek new approaches and ways to overcome the challenges faced by humanity.@@@Based on strategic cooperation with the United Nations, our country will make every effort to achieve these goals.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his successful leadership of the seventy-sixth session of the Assembly.@@@The world today faces a deep crisis of trust at the global level and an intensification of numerous challenges to stability and security, a growth of geopolitical confrontation and an increased risk of bloc mentality.@@@The expansion and aggravation of armed conflicts in various parts of the world are destabilizing international trade and economic ties, which have not yet recovered from the consequences of the pandemic.@@@The challenges of ensuring food and energy security are increasing.@@@The global climate shocks, the growing shortage of natural and water resources, and the spread of infectious diseases all contribute to the aggravation of conflicts and the emergence of humanitarian crises, and they also threaten the foundation of life.@@@Clearly, no country can avoid global risk and challenges or tackle them alone.@@@Constructive dialogue and multilateral cooperation, based on consideration and respect for the interests of all countries, are the only way out of the dangerous spiral of crisis.@@@Effective international cooperation is essential if the world is to become more stable, predictable and prosperous.@@@Under the current conditions, we strongly believe it is important to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in addressing global and regional challenges.@@@The United Nations should evolve in order for it to respond effectively to the transformation taking place.@@@The establishment of intercivilizational and intercultural relations and dialogue is also extremely important for finding coherent approaches and solutions and relieving global tensions, uncertainty and unpredictability.@@@With that in mind, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit that was held in Samarkand on 16 September, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, put forward the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity.@@@Its goal is to contribute to the restoration of mutual trust and stability in international relations, as well as to strengthen solidarity through the establishment of broad dialogue free from geopolitical rivalry, ideological contradictions and disputes.@@@We propose to jointly exchange views on the practical implementation of that initiative at the Samarkand forum to be held in 2023, with the participation of United Nations representatives, political leaders, the public business community and academia.@@@This year, we adopted the Development Strategy for New Uzbekistan for 2022-2026, which aims to deepen the democratic process, ensure the rule of law and improve living standards.@@@The strategy is based on the outcomes of the reforms carried out in our country over the previous five years and is designed to advance the comprehensive implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In particular, by 2030 we intend to halve the level of poverty, increase the effectiveness of the social protection system to respond to all those in need, strengthen food security and become one of the world’s upper-middle-income countries.@@@Currently, Uzbekistan is on the eve of an important political event: a constitutional reform.@@@The key goal of updating the Constitution is to ensure sustainability and responsibility in the process of the fundamental transformation of the State system and public administration in a way that will respect and protect the honour and dignity of the people and guarantee their inviolable rights and freedoms.@@@The idea of human honour and dignity will be deeply enshrined in the Constitution.@@@Norms on the complete abolition of the death penalty, the Miranda rule and habeas corpus, as well as environmental human rights, will be introduced in the Constitution.@@@The constitutional amendments will become directly applicable and aim to guarantee and protect the interests of people of all backgrounds.@@@In particular, the prohibition of forced labour and the other worst forms of child labour and the protection of the employment rights of pregnant women and women with children will be guaranteed at the constitutional level.@@@Furthermore, the introduction of norms that ensure the openness, transparency and accountability of State agencies has also been proposed.@@@The amendments to the Constitution were reviewed by the public and will be put to a referendum.@@@We fully endorse the initiative of Secretary- General Antonio Guterres to hold the Summit of the Future in September 2023.@@@Uzbekistan greatly appreciates the successful outcome of the historic Transforming Education Summit, which demonstrated the commitment of the international community to advance efforts to achieve the rapid restoration and modernization of the education system by increasing funding and innovation.@@@Uzbekistan has already achieved tangible results in that area.@@@Over the past five years, enrolment in higher education increased from 9 to 29 per cent, and the rate of enrolment of children in preschool education increased from 27 to 67 per cent.@@@Young people should play a key role in the processes that are directly related to their fate and future.@@@To that end, Uzbekistan plans to convene the first meeting of the Youth Council of the countries of Central Asia and South Asia in 2023, which will become a platform for new ideas and specific initiatives.@@@We count on the support of the United Nations in convening that important forum.@@@From 14 to 16 November in Tashkent, we will host jointly with UNESCO the World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education.@@@That forum will facilitate the exchange of best practices to ensure universal, equitable and quality education.@@@We invite the Ministers of Education of Member States to participate in that high-level forum.@@@Thanks to the joint efforts of the Central Asian States, a fundamentally new political atmosphere has been created in our region.@@@Launched at the initiative of Uzbekistan, the mechanism of consultative meetings of the Heads of State of the region has become a vivid symbol of a new era of regional cooperation.@@@At the most recent consultative meeting, held on 21 July, the truly historic Treaty of Friendship, Good Neighbourliness and Cooperation for the Development of Central Asia in the Twenty-First century was agreed.@@@The international recognition of the deepening partnership of the countries of the region is reflected in a number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in support of strengthening peace, stability and regional cooperation in Central Asia.@@@We rely on the further support of the international community in the process of rapprochement and cooperation among the countries of Central Asia and the integration of the region into the global economy and transport networks.@@@We express our gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for supporting our initiative to hold an international conference on the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia, which was held in March in Tashkent.@@@Taking into account the outcomes of that forum, we propose the establishment of a United Nations counter-terrorism regional office in Central Asia in order to successfully implement the Global Strategy and continuously monitor the implementation of the updated Joint Plan of Action of Central Asian States.@@@The prospects for the development of Central Asia are inextricably linked to ensuring peace in neighbouring Afghanistan.@@@We are concerned about the decline in the international attention being placed on that country, which is experiencing a deep humanitarian crisis.@@@We consider it extremely important to prevent the isolation of Afghanistan, which is being left to address its existing problems on its own.@@@That will undoubtedly have negative consequences for regional and international security.@@@The International Conference on Afghanistan, which was held in July in Tashkent with the participation of the delegation of the interim Government, showed the interest of the world community in the development of coordinated approaches towards that country.@@@We are convinced that the overall priority of the international community should be to restore the Afghan economy and ensure its integration into regional economic processes and the implementation of infrastructure and socially significant projects.@@@To solve that problem, the support of the United Nations, international financial institutions and donor countries is needed.@@@Uzbekistan is making a feasible contribution to international efforts to assist Afghanistan.@@@Uzbekistan has established an international transport and logistics hub in the border city of Termez, which is actively used by United Nations agencies to provide humanitarian assistance to the country.@@@We propose that a special humanitarian support fund for Afghanistan be created in Termez and that financial resources be allocated to it in order to overcome the social crisis and implement educational programmes for young people and healthcare projects.@@@Resolution 76/295, on strengthening connectivity between Central and South Asia, which was adopted in July 2022 at the initiative of Uzbekistan, prioritizes the involvement of Afghanistan in economic cooperation and its transformation into a bridge connecting the two regions.@@@The practical implementation of those ideas will be facilitated by the implementation of transregional infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the Termez-Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railway.@@@The solution to the problem of involving Afghanistan in regional trade and economic relations will be facilitated by the proposed establishment by Uzbekistan, with the support of the United Nations, of an interregional centre for connectivity in Tashkent.@@@Today the negative consequences of climate change are acutely apparent in our region.@@@We stand ready to actively participate in multilateral efforts to promote the topical issues of the green agenda and the processes that curb climate change.@@@Uzbekistan has assumed the additional obligation of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and is implementing a comprehensive strategy for the transition to a green economy and the development of renewable energy.@@@In 2021, the President of Uzbekistan launched a broad initiative called “Yashil Makon” or “Green Nation” through which 1 billion trees and shrubs are to be planted across the country over the next five years.@@@The Aral Sea is the largest environmental crisis in our region.@@@Over the past five years, 1.7 million hectares of forest plantings have been introduced on
the drained seabed.@@@I take this opportunity to thank the General Assembly for adopting the resolution declaring the Aral Sea region a zone of ecological innovation and technologies (resolution 75/278).@@@This year, under the auspices of the United Nations, we plan to host in Nukus the first Aral Sea international forum.@@@In 2023, we will host the fourteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, as well as a meeting in Uzbekistan of the Committee to Review the Implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.@@@We invite the Member States and United Nations agencies to take part in these events at the highest level.@@@This year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Uzbekistan’s membership in the United Nations, which is the only universal structure for maintaining international peace and security.@@@We reaffirm Uzbekistan’s commitment to the United Nations Charter and express readiness to deepen multifaceted cooperation with the Organization.@@@On behalf of the Government of Tuvalu, I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@Tuvalu has full confidence in his leadership.@@@Let me also take this opportunity to thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, the Honourable Minister Abdulla Shahid, for a very successful session under his leadership, despite the challenges arising from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@We welcome the pragmatic vision of Mr. Korosi’s presidency of the General Assembly at its current session.@@@We applaud him for the theme of his presidency, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@Indeed, we must strengthen our commitment to upholding the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations at this watershed moment.@@@We maintain that the Charter is our shared constitutive instrument for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights.@@@We are indeed encouraged by the priorities of his presidency, and we look forward to working closely with him as we continue to grapple with economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, tackle climate change and strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Global crises have become more complex, interlinked and transboundary in their impacts, demanding global cooperation and solidarity to formulate and implement sustainable solutions.@@@That requires all the partnerships we need to bring about positive changes to people’s lives.@@@It is, however, regrettable that the Republic of China on Taiwan, with its notable partnerships on a wide range of development issues, continues to be kept out of the United Nations system.@@@Tuvalu has significantly benefited from our partnerships in agriculture, food security, public health, medicine and clean energy, including our recovery from the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Tuvalu strongly supports the readmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations as a founding Member of the Organization, and the restoration of its active participation in United Nations specialized agencies, including the World
Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We must not sideline Taiwan, which is a vibrant democracy that has made significant progress on all the Sustainable Development Goals and is ready to contribute more to global efforts to achieve the SDGs.@@@It is also regrettable that the people of Cuba continue to face the economic burden of long-standing unilateral economic blockades.@@@The economic blockades neglect the human rights and spirit of cooperation espoused in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Keeping those measures in place has deprived Cuba of the international development assistance and partnerships necessary to recover and build back better.@@@In the same vein, we reiterate the strong concerns of our region about the potential threat of nuclear contamination posed to the health and security of the blue Pacific, its people and prospects, and reaffirm the importance of ensuring international consultations, international law and independent and verifiable scientific assessments.@@@Those principles must govern the deployment and use of nuclear technology and the discharge of nuclear materials and waste into our blue Pacific continent.@@@We maintain that the United Nations decolonization process is critical to the protection of human rights, including the right to self-determination, and urge the meaningful engagement of the United Nations with all relevant partners and stakeholders in the decolonization process.@@@Let me now speak of an issue that is of the greatest concern to my country.@@@Climate change and its consequential sea-level rise remain the single greatest existential threat my country faces, underscoring the urgent need to limit global warming to 1.5°C through rapid, deep and sustained reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@With an average land elevation of no more than 2 metres above sea level, my country will succumb to sea-level rise.@@@The report issued last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear that, with the current global-warming trend, we are destined to miss the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@That clearly means that Tuvalu will be totally submerged within the century.@@@The climate crisis is creating an increasingly uncertain future for people in most parts of the world.@@@Paradoxically, in my region, the Pacific, it is making our future increasingly certain, but not in a way that gives us any kind of comfort.@@@During this century, several Pacific island nations will become mostly uninhabitable.@@@For my country, Tuvalu, which sits halfway between Hawaii and Australia, that could happen in the next two to three decades.@@@Other Pacific island countries on the front line of climate change may have a few decades longer, but our final destination is no longer a matter of guesswork.@@@Most societies see climate change as mainly about cutting carbon emissions or mitigating future impacts.@@@We are facing a looming situation far more profound — the near certainty of terminal inundation.@@@Our peoples, in my generation or the next, will be unable to exist on the islands that have nurtured our ancestors for centuries.@@@It is our God-given home.@@@Tuvalu and its Pacific neighbours have done nothing to cause climate change.@@@Carbon emissions combined across the entirety of the Pacific islands amount to less than 0.03 per cent of the world’s total, and even less if we are speaking of historical emissions.@@@The existential threat we face is not of our making, but it will remake us.@@@How we will negotiate that remaking is a question that the international community must now urgently begin to address.@@@Major economies, which contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions, cannot be oblivious and do nothing.@@@People everywhere, across all ages and walks of life, are demanding leadership on climate change, especially from those most able to provide it.@@@Tuvalu is an acid test for such leadership because, if the international community allows an entire country to disappear as a result of climate change, what hope will be possible for anyone else?@@@These are unprecedented times.@@@Science cannot tell us exactly when our homeland will become uninhabitable, but it does tell us how.@@@As the ocean rises, salt water permeates the aquifers that provide our drinking water; now, in many places, our water security is now severely compromised.@@@A rising ocean brings higher tides, and with increasing storm frequency and intensity, our villages and agriculture are devastated.@@@Flooding leaves soil saline, reducing crop yields and severely compromising our food security.@@@Infrastructure, such as homes, roads and power lines, are washed away, and higher land on which to rebuild does not exist.@@@The precious coral that supports our tourism and nurtures our fish-stock perishes as the ocean warms and acidifies.@@@The cost of eking out an existence and maintaining the status quo increases for individuals and the entire country and, over time, becomes too
much to bear.@@@Such extreme conditions push citizens to leave.@@@The nation itself becomes increasingly inchoate, legally and spiritually rooted to a shoreline that is disappearing under rising tides.@@@That is how a Pacific atoll dies.@@@That is how our islands will cease to exist.@@@This is not about some future scenario — it is what we are living with now.@@@Inaction entails responsibilities.@@@Tuvalu has not yet reached the end of the process of salination, destruction, degradation and demise, but we are well past the beginning.@@@Despite international agreements and repeated commitments, global greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise, with many countries still pursuing a future fuelled by coal, oil and gas.@@@This is the first time in history that the collective action of many nations — or, more accurately, the collective inaction of many nations — will be responsible for making sovereign countries uninhabitable.@@@It is an unprecedented crisis requiring radical intervention.@@@Current international instruments such as the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness do not cover our situation, nor do the United Nations various efforts to address climate change.@@@Agreements reached at its annual summits, including the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow last year, cover a wide range of issues like targets for cutting emissions or commitments for international finance to address impacts.@@@But, with regard to the looming uninhabitability of sovereign States, they say nothing.@@@That is why Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands launched the Rising Nations Initiative, two days ago, to fill the current gaps in awareness, legal frameworks and political commitments.@@@The global community must begin a serious and responsible dialogue that acknowledges both the realities and the rights of Pacific island nations like mine and, more fundamentally, of our citizens.@@@This is about sovereignty, dignity and integrity.@@@We need a global settlement that guarantees nation States, such as Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, a permanent existence beyond the inhabitable lifetime of our atoll homes, irrespective of the onslaught of climate change and sea-level rise.@@@It must recognize and protect our cultural integrity, our human and economic capital and our sovereignty.@@@It must be co-created and enacted with the Governments and the peoples of island nations, not visited upon us by others.@@@Such a settlement must ultimately include the protection of our rights to our land and ocean and preserves our heritage and sovereign right to govern our citizens.@@@We do not seek to move from our homeland.@@@We seek the fair and amicable treatment of displaced people so that we do not become a burden on others.@@@Equally, however, natural justice also dictates that we not be fobbed off with a wasteland.@@@Economically, we can continue to support ourselves, for example, in the case of Tuvalu, by using the income from the continued sustainable use of the exclusive economic zone around our islands.@@@Finding the right solution will require statesmanship and empathy, beginning with an acknowledgement that a situation globally caused must also have a globally just and equitable solution.@@@As Pacific peoples, we raise our children to respect the ocean, land and sky as providers of life.@@@Now, through no fault of our own, we will soon have to abandon the oceans, land and sky that have forged our cultures and identities for centuries.@@@We neither castigate nor demand charity, but we do ask for generosity of spirit, support and justice that recognize our reality and our grave concern about the potential eradication of our atoll nations by rising sea levels in our part of the world.@@@First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I am confident that under his leadership, this session will be conducted with efficiency and effectiveness.@@@I would also like to express my appreciation to the previous President, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his excellent leadership of the seventy-sixth session in the face of various constraints and challenges.@@@Malaysia welcomes the theme chosen for this year’s session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@We believe that the theme is most apt for the situation we are going through together.@@@During the seventy-sixth session of General Assembly, we heard a high level of commitment and pledged to work together.@@@That has given hope to the world.@@@Numerous statements were issued, all inspiring hope, including in me, that the spirit of a world family would allow us to set aside our differences.@@@That commitment enables us to rise from the pandemic and together overcome the challenges we face.@@@Even so, that spirit of optimism is fading.@@@I am concerned by the challenges that remain unaddressed and are , in fact, deteriorating.@@@Many challenges remain unresolved.@@@A major lesson the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic taught us is that we cannot run from every challenge that confronts us.@@@Being selfish and not caring about the impact on others will only generate mistrust in international cooperation.@@@In an interconnected world, the policies and decisions of some countries can affect others.@@@For example, in addressing the current inflation around the world, one country’s monetary policy and control of interest rates has an impact on other countries.@@@That is where cooperation and coordination among countries need to be stepped up if we are to achieve the goal of a more just economic well-being for all.@@@In an international financial and monetary structure that is still dominated by a few major Powers, and in the context of world economic recovery, domestic monetary decisions have to be adjusted by taking the reality and needs of developing countries into account.@@@In that connection, Malaysia urges Member States to establish a cooperative international monetary mechanism to build a more effective and just system that is able to balance the needs of global development.@@@One truth that we should not forget is that conflicts have nothing but negative effects for the whole world.@@@It is because of conflict that we are now facing various problems, such as lack of nutrients and food resources.@@@In that regard, Malaysia calls on all countries to emphasize the issue of food security so as to guarantee sufficient food resources for all.@@@The United Nations Charter and international law are there to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes between countries.@@@The Charter and the laws set the limits of a country’s pursuit of its own interests.@@@Based on that principle, Malaysia opposes violations of international law, including the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity of any nation.@@@When a conflict erupts, all parties have the responsibility to ease tension and prioritize the safety and lives of civilians.@@@At the same time, the conflicting parties need to return to the negotiating table to stop the conflict as soon as possible.@@@Malaysia does not approve of the isolation of a country from international organizations.@@@Such a measure is against the principle of multilateralism and hinders dialogue.@@@The price to be paid for war is high.@@@That is proven by the situation experienced by Ukraine.@@@The effects are felt not only by the people and the country but also by the world.@@@This conflict has threatened peace, global security and the economy, and undermined food security.@@@Malaysia welcomes the creation of a sea corridor that allows for the shipment of grain from Ukraine.@@@This is a positive step in addressing the food security problem.@@@In that regard, Malaysia reiterates its insistence that all countries, especially the major Powers, refrain from creating isolation blocs that will only push the world towards a cold war.@@@The world needs to realize that peace can be achieved only through dialogue and negotiation.@@@As for the occupied Palestinian territories, Malaysia is disappointed by the brutal occupation by Israel, which has been going on for a long time.@@@The Palestinian people continue to live under the shackles of Israel’s discriminatory policies.@@@Illegal settlements are becoming more widespread, in violation of international law, including Security Council resolution 2334 (2016).@@@The most basic rights of the Palestinian people continue to be denied.@@@Malaysia is therefore of the view that the major Powers need to be honest in resolving the issue of cruelty faced by the Palestinian people.@@@The United Nations should take a firm stand to ensure that the longstanding crisis in Palestine is resolved quickly.@@@Many countries today have been quick to act in the case of Ukraine.@@@Malaysia wants the same action to be taken to resolve the issue of Palestine.@@@Israel needs to stop being an apartheid entity!@@@Although we are still threatened by conflicts among countries, we cannot ignore other crises around the world.@@@The pillar of strength for a conflict-free world is living together in a culture of peace.@@@Malaysia, as a multiracial, multicultural and multireligious country, always supports and strives for the concept of peaceful coexistence among races, beliefs and cultures.@@@Malaysia has played an important role in conflict resolution in South-East Asia.@@@For example, Malaysia has been involved in the peace process between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front since 2001.@@@In addition, Malaysia has always been proactive in helping to resolve regional crises and conflicts.@@@However, Malaysia has been disappointed with the situation in Myanmar since the coup that took place in February 2021.@@@It is very saddening that the Security Council has taken no serious action to deal with the situation.@@@Some even see the Security Council as having washed its hands of the matter and handing it over to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).@@@Malaysia is disappointed that there has been no meaningful progress in the implementation of the ASEAN five-point consensus, especially on the part of the Myanmar junta.@@@The ASEAN five-point consensus cannot continue any longer in its current form.@@@It needs to be given a new lease of life and refined based on a clearer framework, time frame and end goal.@@@Even more important is that the aspirations of the people of Myanmar must be fulfilled.@@@The political crisis in Myanmar has also aggravated the situation of millions of Myanmar refugees, including the Rohingya refugees.@@@Although Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, it has accepted nearly 200,000 Rohingya refugees on humanitarian grounds.@@@It is the responsibility of all countries, including those participating in the Convention, to welcome and resettle more refugees.@@@At the same time, Malaysia strongly emphasizes the importance of the world’s addressing the root cause of the Rohingya crisis.@@@I believe that this issue will not be resolved as long as the crisis in the country continues.@@@The conflicts and crises that occur in the world, including in Ukraine, Palestine and Myanmar, cannot be resolved due to the debility of the global governance system and the United Nations.@@@The biggest problem in the United Nations is the Security Council.@@@The power of veto is often misused to favour the world Powers that have it.@@@It is not democratic and violates the principles of democracy.@@@That makes it impossible for conflicts to be resolved by any of the permanent members of the Council.@@@In line with the principle of one-country one-vote, now is the time to abolish the veto power.@@@As an Organization that brings the spirit and symbol of democracy to the world, the United Nations needs to return to its foundations.@@@Climate change is a universal problem that affects us all.@@@Last year alone, Malaysia was struck by the most serious floods in its history, resulting in losses estimated at $1.4 billion or 6.1 billion ringgit.@@@Many lives were lost and almost 100,000 people had to be moved to temporary evacuation centres.@@@That situation arose not only in Malaysia but in several other countries as well.@@@Clearly, mitigation and adaptation measures need to continue.@@@The fact remains that developed countries must bear the responsibility of increasing aid for developing countries by fulfilling their commitment to providing an unconditional yearly allocation of $100 billion.@@@That will help realize the actions taken against climate change that should have been implemented since 2020.@@@COVID-19 has slowed our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@I stand here as the representative of a developing country to assert that the implementation and success of a greener and more sustainable socioeconomic development will be achieved with a fair and inclusive response to that pledge.@@@The fact is that new technology is an incentive for nations to switch to renewable energy.@@@However, that new technology must first be affordable to developing countries.@@@In that regard, Malaysia is committed to shouldering its responsibilities and roles to ensure environmental conservation and sustainability.@@@Malaysia has undertaken various measures in that context.@@@For example, in the palm oil industry, Malaysia has introduced the Malaysian sustainable palm oil standard to meet requirements for the purpose of sustainable development.@@@Malaysia is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent, based on gross domestic product, by 2030.@@@In that regard, Malaysia has set a target of achieving 31 per cent renewable energy use by 2025.@@@Malaysia is also committed to achieving its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.@@@The national energy policy 2022-2040 was implemented in Malaysia on 19 September to build macroeconomic resilience and energy supply security.@@@Malaysia has agreed to establish a National SDG Centre to intensify SDG programmes and monitor their progress.@@@As one of only 17 biodiverse countries in the world, Malaysia is aware of its responsibility to maintain and preserve its natural resources for future generations.@@@During the Earth Summit in 1992, Malaysia pledged to maintain at least 50 per cent of its land mass under forest and tree cover.@@@Three decades on, the entire Malaysian territory today remains 54 per cent forested.@@@That percentage will increase following ongoing aggressive reforestation measures.@@@Not only Malaysia, but the entire world also needs to be more sensitive to efforts to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals by 2030.@@@In that regard, Malaysia welcomes the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, to be held next year.@@@That effort is timely because it will give us the opportunity to look back at what has been achieved and what can be improved for the benefit of the world family.@@@We all share the same concerns on all the issues I have raised.@@@Malaysia remains optimistic.@@@I call on Member States to play their respective roles in overcoming the challenges we face.@@@However, we have to do it together as one big family — the world family.@@@United we stand; divided we fall.@@@As long as we are united and strong together in shouldering this burden, I am sure we will succeed.@@@Today I invite the international community to work together by practicing the spirit of the world family in facing global challenges.@@@Malaysia will continue to give its full commitment.@@@Seychelles congratulates you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@We also extend our profound appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Abdullah Shahid, for his leadership during the preceding session.@@@I would also like to express our gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his efforts to pursue a common agenda for the United Nations at a time when faith in the multilateral system needs, more than ever, to be restored.@@@We perhaps need to be reminded that multilateralism gives each one of us the opportunity and the means to solve complex challenges that we cannot overcome on our own.@@@Never have we faced challenges of such magnitude: a world in deep crisis, climate inaction, the aftermath of the pandemic, food insecurity, the rising costs of energy and the war in Ukraine.@@@We have reached an inflection point that compels us to question the trajectory of our multilateral order, as the perils to our collective well-being are acute and numerous.@@@Faced with a multiplicity of interrelated challenges that many of us are least responsible for but most affected by, the plight of States in vulnerable situations has never been more pronounced.@@@Many of us in the developing world have had to revise our 2030 aspirations, owing to lost progress.@@@Economic inequity is the biggest impediment to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The blueprint for a better and sustainable future
requires financial resources that many of us simply do not have or are unable to access, since development cooperation modalities fail to consider vulnerability as a barrier to durable development.@@@Time and again, small island developing States (SIDS) have consistently reiterated the call for a globally accepted vulnerability assessment put forward at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.@@@Our island nations have experienced the greatest economic loss from the pandemic, with economic contractions averaging 7 per cent.@@@Yet very few of us were able to access the meagre 6 per cent of coronavirus disease funding allocated to developing countries.@@@We cannot continue to rely on temporary solutions to address the systemic faults within the existing development cooperation mechanisms.@@@If this is to be a watershed moment, we must put into practice real solutions that focus on addressing vulnerabilities and building resilience to ensure socioeconomic sustainability.@@@We need the international financial institutions and multilateral development banks to look beyond the gross national income benchmark.@@@There is broad consensus that a multidimensional vulnerability index offers a specific approach that will complement and improve the efficacy of development cooperation, permitting countries in vulnerable situations to access concessional financing and address their needs.@@@I therefore welcome the interim report of the High-level Panel on the Development of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for Small Island Developing States and hope that progress on universally accepted and inclusive indicators that capture the vulnerabilities of all developing States can be accelerated ahead of the 2023 deadline.@@@The current food and energy crisis, exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, poses a threat to sustainable growth globally, necessitating integrated systemic responses.@@@The challenge for us in Africa is how to guarantee that trade contributes meaningfully to food security.@@@In that regard, the African Continental Free Trade Area has a vital role to play by stimulating intra-trade among ourselves by ensuring that we redistribute food produced from regions with a surplus to regions facing deficits.@@@The solutions to our food security can be achievable.@@@We firmly believe that harnessing the potential of the blue economy by tapping into fisheries and aquaculture resources can be a viable option for addressing food and nutrition insecurity that prevails at the moment.@@@Food and energy security must be apprehended within the context of climate change.@@@We are at the cusp of an ecological collapse spurred by climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss, largely instigated by irresponsible human activities and unfettered emissions — a situation that greatly threatens the inalienable right of all humans to a healthy environment.@@@The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have made clear that the window of opportunity to effectively address climate change is rapidly closing, with dire consequences for humankind and ecosystems.@@@Failing to act decisively and urgently now will lead to untold costs, with those least responsible for the calamity having to bear the heaviest price.@@@As floods, heat waves and fires in the Western world dominate the news and our social media feeds, let us not neglect or forget that the impact of slow-onset events like sea-level rise pose an existential threat to small island developing States.@@@We need bold actions, not unfulfilled promises and pledges.@@@In defining this watershed moment, individual interests must converge into collective benefits.@@@We must also confront the gross injustice of having citizens of States least responsible for the unravelling climate-induced disaster pay for the loss and damage caused by others.@@@Even as we bear the impact of climate change, our environment is suffering immensely from the consequences of pollution.@@@Seychelles can attest to that fact, as our shores and sea have become encumbered by plastic waste.@@@I am nonetheless heartened that a historical agreement to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee with the mandate to forge an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution was achieved at the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly.@@@Hopefully, that will raise ambitions in other areas of environmental protection, including in the protection of biodiversity.@@@The pressure that human activities are exerting on biodiversity are tipping the scale towards mass extinction across the globe.@@@Therefore, the fifteenth meeting of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will be critical for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.@@@If the world is to achieve the framework’s ambitious targets, ensure that the SDGs are met and tackle the interrelated planetary crisis, we must invest in the means of the framework’s implementation.@@@Related to that is the issue of the oceans that surround us.@@@Healthy oceans are critical to life on Earth.@@@As a foremost proponent of the blue economy paradigm,
Seychelles has taken bold steps to sustainably harness its ocean for the benefit of its people.@@@By implementing our marine spatial plan, we have not only set aside 30 per cent of our exclusive economic zone for protection and sustainable use, but also have helped consolidate progress towards our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the SDGs and the Convention on Biological Diversity.@@@The marine spatial plan exemplifies how climate action, ocean conservation, sustainable development and building resilience can be achieved by a SIDS, with immutable special circumstances, in an integrated manner.@@@Building on that, Seychelles has committed to protecting at least 50 per cent of its seagrass ecosystems by 2025, and 100 per cent by 2030, greatly contributing to ecosystem preservation and carbon sequestration.@@@We call on other littoral and oceanic States to be as bold in their ocean commitments.@@@As we progress in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, it is imperative that we invest in science’s best approaches and forge the strong partnerships needed to achieve a better understanding and protection of the ocean.@@@Beyond the preservation of our natural environment, such holistic measures can be applied to the myriad interlocking challenges that we are facing as a global community.@@@It will take our combined will, conclusive action and uncompromising respect for the founding principles of the United Nations to secure a better future for all.@@@Last but of no less importance is the situation in Ukraine.@@@The Ukraine-Russia conflict is of great concern to us.@@@It poses a grave threat to global security and world peace, with serious ramifications for the entire community of nations.@@@My country’s stance on the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy is universally recognized.@@@In that regard, the Republic of Seychelles strongly supports the call of the Chair of the African Union and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission urging the parties concerned to establish an immediate ceasefire and to resume negotiations in order to preserve the world from the consequences of planetary conflict and to find a permanent and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.@@@We must find common ground for the sake of humankind and our planet.@@@In attempting to utilize this critical moment in history as a turning point to bring about real positive change, the choice is clearly with every one of us to decide whether our actions will lead to shared prosperity or mutual destruction.@@@Let us be reminded of our moral responsibility as world leaders to take bold and decisive steps that will truly bring about transformative solutions.@@@We share only one planet, and our fates are indivisible.@@@Let us secure a better future together.@@@I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its current session, and I thank your predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Maldives, for presiding over the previous session.@@@I also thank the Secretary-General for the efforts he is making pursuant to the mandate entrusted to him by the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We meet today at a time of sensitive and dangerous situations at the international level.@@@Wars, conflicts and threats to international peace and security are increasing along with terrorism and chaos, while the global economy and food security are at risk and climate change is accelerating.@@@It is noteworthy that all of that comes as a result of the insistence by some States on imposing their hegemony on other States, seizing their resources and wealth and seeking to achieve their own narrow agendas, including by investing in terrorism, imposing economic blockades and using lethal weapons in disregard of all the international laws and norms unanimously agreed on by humankind.@@@Those States have waged wars and occupied others’ lands on the pretext of spreading democracy and protecting human rights, but in reality they have destroyed countries and killed many innocent people, and what happened in our region is just one example of that.@@@Those States called the terrorists they supported a moderate opposition seeking freedom.@@@Very moderate indeed.@@@The terrorists were just tools to destroy countries that would not submit to the whims of those States and were not subject to their agendas.@@@They called their sanctions “smart”, but in reality they are nothing but tools for killing and collectively punishing the peoples who stand by their countries, their sovereignty and their armies.@@@What they did in Syria in terms of preventing the arrival of food, medicine, heating fuel and other basic necessities of life to the Syrian people is the best evidence of that.@@@While we are aware of this sad reality, we call for taking the right decision, at this defining and delicate moment in our world history, in a way that will ensure a better present and future for us and future generations and that lays the foundations for building a new, multipolar world order in which everyone works under the umbrella of the purposes and principles of the Charter.@@@Of course, it is understood that we are proceeding in this call based on real experience that cannot be separated from that, because in its broader context the war on Syria was part of the West’s attempts to maintain its control over the world.@@@Although that war has failed to achieve its goals, including breaking Syria’s will and isolating it from its surroundings and the rest of the world, we cannot deny that it has been a bitter and costly experience for us Syrians, who have lived for more than 10 years under the brutality of organized terrorism sponsored by well-known Governments and under the yoke of occupation, illegal military intervention, an inhumane economic blockade and merciless unilateral coercive measures.@@@At a time when we hoped to achieve peace and stability in our region, we have witnessed an increase in Israel’s practices pushing our region to unprecedented levels of tension and instability, whether by carrying out massacres, escalating military aggression against Palestinian territories and killing civilians, or through a continuation of its policies of settlement, Judaization, siege, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and racial discrimination.@@@Israel’s practices constitute crimes for which impunity will no longer be accepted.@@@Syria affirms once again that it will not retreat from its support for its brother people of Palestine in their struggle to liberate their occupied territories and establish an independent and sovereign State on all their lands, with Jerusalem as its capital.@@@The right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland must be guaranteed, in accordance with international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@Syria supports Palestine’s decision to obtain its long-awaited full membership in the United Nations, and we urge the Assembly to ensure that that is not obstructed by certain members of the Security Council.@@@Ever since its occupation of the Syrian Golan in 1967 Israel has continued to commit the most heinous and systematic forms of gross violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law, including building more settlements and changing the demographic composition and institutional structure of the region, especially through attempts to impose Israeli citizenship and ownership documents by force on the people of the Golan, not to mention its looting of Golan’s natural resources, burial of nuclear waste in its ground, seizure of land to erect huge wind turbines, and other documented violations.@@@Israel has added a new chapter to its black record by supporting Da’esh and the Al-Nusra Front.@@@Israel has deliberately and systematically targeted civilian facilities, including civilian seaports and airports, undermining both regional and global peace and security, endangering the lives of civilians and jeopardizing the safety of civil aviation in Syria and the region.@@@The Israeli leaders who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians and
Syrians alike have no right to say from international rostrums that they are keen to protect civilians and human rights.@@@Syria notes that continued support or silence vis-a-vis such Israeli practices by certain States that claim to be the guardians of international humanitarian law and international human rights law make them complicit in such crimes, revealing the double standards applied.@@@Syria will exercise its legitimate right to defend its land and its people by any means necessary so that the Israeli occupation authorities are held accountable for their crimes.@@@It is our right to recover all the occupied Syrian Golan, a territory dear to the hearts of all Syrians, along the 4 June 1967 borders.@@@It is our inalienable right that is not subject to pressures and statute of limitations, guaranteed in accordance with international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular resolution 497 (1981).@@@Any illegal military presence on Syrian territories runs counter to international law and the Charter of the United Nations and must cease immediately without preconditions.@@@Combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and ultimately uprooting terrorism can take place only through cooperation and coordination with the Syrian State, with full respect for its sovereignty, independence territorial integrity and unity.@@@Combating terrorism cannot take place through and illegitimate international coalition that violates the sovereignty of States while destroying villages and cities, massacring civilians, plundering national wealth and supporting separatist militias.@@@Combating terrorism cannot take place by occupying other peoples’ territories, implementing forced displacement policies and changing their demographics, nor by setting up so- called safe zones and working with terrorists, nor by collectively punishing civilians by cutting off water supplies.@@@As for the separatist militias that are still cherishing the illusions of their sponsors, they must be made aware of the realities and abstain from counting on foreign occupiers.@@@Those who do not stand by their homeland have no homeland.@@@Since the beginning of the 2011 crisis, the Syrian State has called for national and local settlements and reconciliations as a way to return to normalcy throughout Syria, in order to promote national unity and consolidate cohesiveness within Syrian society.@@@To that end, 21 amnesty decrees have been issued, the latest of which was legislative decree 7 of 2022, by President Bashar Al-Assad of the Syrian Arab Republic.@@@That decree grants a general amnesty for crimes of terrorism committed by Syrians, with the exception of fatal crimes, and is especially important owing to its legal, political and social nature.@@@It represents an effort and determination by the Syrian State to ensure national reconciliation, reach social coherence and achieve lasting stability.@@@The Syrian State will continue its efforts on the basis of such an approach, which has been effective on the ground and has enabled many Syrians to return to normal life.@@@Despite the difficult circumstances that Syria has undergone, my country has honoured its constitutional deadlines.@@@A few days ago, before I came to New York, we held democratic elections for local councils, with 59,000 candidates competing over 8,619 seats, reflecting great popular participation and support for democracy and decentralization in every village, city, district and governorate in Syria.@@@In parallel, Syria dealt positively with efforts and initiatives under the political process and, in that regard, we reiterate our support for the meetings held according to the Astana format.@@@We also welcome the results of the summit held in Tehran on 19 July, which reaffirmed the commitment to Syria’s sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity.@@@It also reaffirmed rejection of separatist plans and the total abolishment of terrorist groups.@@@However, all of that will be unfortunately dead letter if Tiirkiye continues to completely refuse those results, including the provisions of the Astana agreement.@@@Moreover, Syria is following with interest the work being done by the Constitutional Committee, which was established through the national dialogue held in Sochi, Russian Federation, in 2018.@@@The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria must play his role as a facilitator for intra-Syrian dialogue in that process, which must be Syrian-owned and Syrian-led, in accordance with his mandate.@@@All Assembly members are aware that, before the terrorist war was launched against us in 2011, Syria was one of the safest, most prosperous and most stable countries in the world.@@@We were self-sufficient and able to meet the basic needs of our people in an exceptional manner in the region, whether in education, health or public services sectors.@@@However, the impacts of that unjust war changed the situation.@@@We have witnessed an unbearable humanitarian crisis, but what is the reason for it?@@@The answer is quite clear: the primary cause is terrorism, and then the unilateral coercive measures imposed by Western States and the plundering of the wealth of the Syrian people.@@@One such example is that, according to estimates, direct and indirect losses in the oil, gas and mineral sectors in Syria from 2011 to 2022 have reached $107 billion.@@@We are seeking compensation for those losses.@@@Today we need a world of peace, security and stability, not a world of monsters.@@@The Syrian State is doing everything it can to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and to rebuild what terrorism has destroyed, including by facilitating the return of Syrian refugees.@@@We are keen to provide the United Nations with all necessary facilities to improve and promote delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need and to implement early recovery projects pursuant to resolution 2642 (2022).@@@Despite all of our reservations about it, we believe that the resolution may constitute an additional step towards improving the humanitarian situation in Syria and bolstering access to basic services.@@@However, that will depend on the implementation by Western States of the provisions of the resolution, in particular the need to step up humanitarian aid and implement early recovery projects for providing water, electricity, sanitation, health care, education and housing.@@@Resolution 2585 (2021) has proved that those projects can be implemented only if Western States cease to insist on politicizing the humanitarian and development work in Syria and stop placing obstacles and limitations to their implementation, particularly through imposing unilateral coercive measures or so- called economic sanctions.@@@My country, Syria, reiterates its position on the Russian special military operation in Ukraine and on the Russian Federation’s right to defend itself and secure its national security as a response to the aggressive western policies.@@@We are confident that the Russian Federation is defending not only itself, but also the world, the principles of justice, humanity and the rights of all of us in the world who reject hegemony and unipolarism.@@@Syria reiterates once again its full support to the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the return to the nuclear agreement, from which the United States withdrew illegally and unilaterally.@@@We also commend the constructive and responsible approach adopted by Iran on the matter, and we call upon the United States and its western allies to comply with the legitimate Iranian demands.@@@Syria continues to support the principle of a unified China and the People’s Republic of China’s position with regard to addressing foreign interference in its domestic affairs in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Xinjiang.@@@We insist on China’s inalienable right to take the necessary measures to defend its sovereignty, in particular with regard to the unprecedented escalation and the United States of America’s policy of provocation against China.@@@Syria condemns the embargo that has been imposed on Cuba for decades, including the extension of the United States Administration of the so-called Trading with the Enemy Act.@@@Who is the enemy?@@@Is it the Cuban people, the Syrian people or the Russian people?@@@They create imaginary enemies.@@@Syria also calls for an end to the military movements and exercises by the United States on the Korean peninsula leading to the escalation of tensions in the region.@@@Syria calls for the lifting of all unilateral coercive measures imposed by the Western countries on Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Belarus, Nicaragua, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Zimbabwe, Eritrea and all other countries suffering under such measures in the world, including my own country, Syria.@@@Those measures constitute economic terrorism and are no less, in their brutal and dangerous nature, than armed terrorism, both in legal terms and in terms of the inhumane consequences for the peoples targeted.@@@Syria also stresses the need to cease all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of those countries and to respect their sovereignty in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@In conclusion, the world has witnessed circumstances that were exceptional by any standard in the past few years.@@@It was subjected to serious challenges in terms of politics, security, economics, health, nutrition and climate change.@@@We are currently facing unprecedented tensions and escalation at the international level that threaten to bring about further risks.@@@Consequently, our world is headed into the unknown if we do not swiftly an immediately address those challenges collectively, thus meeting the aspirations of our peoples and achieving security, stability, prosperity and sustainable development.@@@The slogan of “no one left behind” should not be an empty one.@@@We are utterly convinced that, in order to realize all of that, we must ensure that some Western States understand that the great Powers are not great only because of their might and military strength, but because they respect the Charter and international law; because they uphold humanitarian principles; and because they abandon self-interests and colonization.@@@Once those States have truly understood that we are living in the same world, they will not prioritize their interests and security over the interests and security of other States.@@@The universal premise of multilateralism, enshrined in our Organization since its very creation, has never been so seriously undermined as it is today, before our very eyes.@@@We are witnessing an unprecedented intensification of crises throughout the world.@@@We are witnessing the proliferation of conflicts and an increase in their complexity.@@@We are witnessing unprecedented food insecurity and dangerous threats to biodiversity.@@@We are even witnessing attempts to call into question the commitments made collectively and ratified here, in this very Hall, on environmental protection and the preservation of the planet, our shared home.@@@As though that were not enough, we are witnessing an exacerbation of dissent and enmity between the permanent members of the Security Council, whose main task is to maintain international peace and security by working together.@@@Faced with such a situation, whereby our common fragilities are aggravated and our collective vulnerabilities highlighted, only a consensus-based, supportive, calm and coordinated approach can help us to find the true answers to those problems.@@@I believe that the theme under which our general debate is being held provides us with a real opportunity to do just that.@@@Indeed, by calling for transformative solutions, this year’s theme appeals to our collective conscience with regard to the increasing number of challenges that besiege us on a daily basis and that can sometimes take a dramatic turn.@@@Indeed, one has only to think of the current war in Ukraine and the apocalyptic projections — which are not baseless — that strategists and other military experts are now making about a possible tragic downturn in those terrible events.@@@Given the enormous risk of nuclear disaster that such events pose to the entire planet, it is the responsibility not just of the conflict’s participants, but also the foreign Powers that can influence the course of events towards peace, if they seek to temper their passions, stop fanning the flames and turn their backs on the vanity of the powerful that has hitherto kept the door to dialogue closed.@@@Under the auspices of the United Nations, we must all commit ourselves, without delay, to peace negotiations that are just, sincere and equitable.@@@Ever since the Congress of Vienna, after the battle of Waterloo, it has been clear that wars must always end around the negotiating table.@@@The world urgently needs negotiations to prevent the current conflicts, which are already so devastating, from reaching a crescendo and tipping humankind into what could be a cataclysm without remedy, namely, a generalized nuclear war beyond the control of the great Powers themselves.@@@Albert Einstein, the great theoretician of the atom, said gravely that such a war, if it were to take place, would be the last battle to ever be fought on Earth.@@@Nelson Mandela, a man of eternal forgiveness, said that peace is a long road, but it has no alternative.@@@It has no price.@@@Indeed, Russians and Ukrainians have no other choice but to take that path — the path of peace.@@@Moreover, we should accompany them, throughout the world, in great numbers, working together in solidarity, tenaciously and fully capable of imposing unconditional peace on the war lobby.@@@I want to be direct and address my dear Russian and Ukrainian friends, in particular.@@@Too much blood has been spilled — the sacred blood of their sweet children.@@@It is time to stop this mass destruction.@@@It is time to stop the war.@@@The entire world is watching.@@@The time has come to fight for life, just as they courageously and selflessly fought together against the Nazis during the Second World War, in particular in Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kursk and Berlin.@@@It is important to consider the young people of both countries and the fate of future generations.@@@It is time to fight for peace.@@@It is time to fight for them.@@@It is important to give peace a real chance now, before it is too late for us all.@@@I humbly ask that of them.@@@What I just said, in my basic Russian, about the events in Ukraine can allow us to draw a parallel, although perhaps at a completely different level, with the tragic situation Libya has been facing since 2011.@@@It is a situation to which, for many years, the President of the Republic of the Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, has been fully committed to resolving on behalf of the African Union.@@@He continued his peace efforts on the controversial issue on 14 and 15 July in Brazzaville, during consultations that brought together several stakeholders who represent the core of Libyan social and political views.@@@The objective was to encourage the stakeholders to talk to each other and bridge the gaps between their views on the challenges their country has faced since the failed elections of 24 December 2021.@@@The inter-Libyan reconciliation conference, which is the goal of the African mediation efforts, will make sense only if it is inclusive, constructive and consensus- based.@@@It must enable our Libyan brothers and sisters to stop eyeing each other with mistrust, forgive each other, resume dialogue and prioritize justice, which is the foundation of a new Libya, from which they are to rewrite history.@@@I would like to commend the appointment of Mr. Abdoulaye Bathily as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya.@@@I can already assure him of the unconditional support of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who chairs the African Union Ad Hoc High-level Committee on Libya.@@@The forests of the Congo basin are the second largest environmental reservoir on the planet, and we have preserved those forests for years, as they are dear to our hearts.@@@We still await strong support that is commensurate with the existential challenges that those forests represent.@@@We should always remember the promises that were made, from Copenhagen to Glasgow and under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Those promises were made with enthusiasm but, to date, they remain unfulfilled by the rich countries — the same countries responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.@@@However, in spite of that, as we prepare for the twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which Africa will host next November, we hope that this time, at least, instead of the statements of commiseration to which we are accustomed and the usual formulas and hollow promises, considerable resources will finally be mobilized for poor countries that have become even more vulnerable owing to climate disruptions.@@@In any event, with the lowest deforestation rate in the world — only 0.06 per cent — my country, the Republic of the Congo, is playing its full role and will continue to do so to protect the environment and ensure the survival of humankind.@@@The establishment of the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin is part of the regional plan for that commitment.@@@Together with the Government of the United Kingdom, the host of COP 26, my country’s Government plans to launch, over the next few weeks, a political forum entitled “Forests and climate leaders’ partnership”.@@@I cannot conclude my statement and leave this rostrum without mentioning two situations, which should unceasingly appeal to our conscience.@@@Morally, we cannot give up on those two situations.@@@The first concerns Security Council reform, which has become a hackneyed topic.@@@It is a reform that everyone glosses over at will and the outcome of which seems to every day draw farther away from its noble goals, although the need for Africa’s inclusion in the management of world affairs is self-evident.@@@Africa must indeed assume its rightful role in the community of nations.@@@To believe otherwise is simply a show of selfishness, and goes against the current of history.@@@Similarly, continuing to prevaricate over the idea of admitting two African countries as full permanent members of the Security Council is nothing more than willingly choosing to discredit our prestigious Organization.@@@We, the representatives of allied countries meeting here at the United Nations, must make the honourable choice, here and now, and go down in history by ridding ourselves, once and for all, of the medieval and obscure prejudices against Africa, which, for too long, have humiliated that part of the world.@@@The second situation concerns the never-ending embargo on Cuba, which has been in place since the middle of the last century and continues to cause indescribable suffering to the people of that country.@@@The embargo, which is totally anachronistic and obsolete, should have been abolished long ago.@@@On behalf of my country, I again call on the wisdom of the American people and its leaders, who, as we know, for the most part, have nothing to do with that outdated embodiment of the Cold War.@@@On that subject, and I wish to conclude here, I would very respectfully like to address President Biden, who has long promoted the ideal of peace, as he did in this very Hall last week (see A/77.PV.6).@@@I urge him to be bold and to close, without further delay, the dark chapter of relations with Cuba, which belongs in the past.@@@By doing so, he will undeniably create new possibilities in the glorious history of his beautiful country, and I am convinced that posterity will thank him.@@@In November 1947, the General Assembly gathered and decided on the creation of a Jewish State.@@@Only a few hundred thousand Jews lived in Israel at the time, in hostile surroundings, shocked and devastated after the Holocaust, in which 6 million of our people were murdered.@@@Seventy-five years later, Israel is a strong, liberal democracy, proud and prosperous.@@@It is the start-up nation that invented Waze and Iron Dome, medicines for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and a robot that can perform spinal surgery, as well as a world leader in water and food technology, cyberdefence and renewable energy, with 13 Nobel prize winners in literature, chemistry, economics and peace.@@@How did this happen?@@@It happened because we decided not to be a victim.@@@We chose not to dwell on the pain of the past but, rather, to focus on the hope of the future.@@@We chose to invest our energies in building a nation and a happy society that is optimistic and creative.@@@We did not only reach the promised land, but we are building the promised land.@@@History is determined by people.@@@We need to understand, respect and learn from history, but we also need to be willing and able to change it, to choose the future over the past, peace over war, partnership over seclusion and isolation.@@@A few months ago, we convened the historic Negev summit.@@@We sat at dinner, not far from the grave of David Ben-Gurion, the founding father of the State of Israel.@@@There were six of us — the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Israel — at a dinner that only two years ago, no one would have believed was possible.@@@Then the door opened, and someone came in and said, “I’m sorry to disturb you, but there was a terror attack not far from Tel Aviv.@@@Two Israelis were murdered.”@@@In an instant, we all understood that the goal of the attack was to destroy the summit, create anger among us, cause us to argue and divide this new partnership among us.@@@I said to the foreign ministers, “We have to condemn this terror attack, right now, together.@@@We have to show the world that terror will not triumph.”@@@The room fell silent.@@@Then one of the Arab foreign ministers said, “We are always against terror, that is why we are here.”@@@Five minutes later, we put out a joint statement from the six of us, condemning the attack and sanctifying life, cooperation and our belief that there is a different way.@@@The summit continued, agreements were signed and working groups were formed to deal with issues of technology, food security, energy, water, education and infrastructure.@@@Those working groups are changing the face of the Middle East as we speak.@@@The people of the Middle East — of the entire world — should look around and ask themselves: who is doing better?@@@Those who chose the path of peace or those who chose the way of war?@@@Those who chose to invest in their people and country or those who chose to invest in the destruction of others?@@@Those who believe in education, tolerance and technology or those who believe in bigotry and violence?@@@Whenever I meet someone who is critical of Israel, I always have the same answer: come and visit us, come and meet the real Israel.@@@You will fall in love with a country that combines breath-taking innovation with a deep sense of history.@@@It has great people, great food, great spirit.@@@It is a vibrant democracy and a country in which Jews, Muslims and Christians live together with full civic equality.@@@In the Government that I lead, there are Arab ministers.@@@There is an Arab party that is a member of our coalition.@@@We have Arab judges on our Supreme Court and Arab doctors saving lives in our hospitals.@@@Israeli Arabs are not our enemies, they
are our partners in life.@@@Come and visit us.@@@You will discover that Israel is an incredible cultural mosaic, from the white snowy mountains of the Golan to the white desert sand of the Negev, from Tel Aviv, the high- tech capital and non-stop party on the Mediterranean Sea, to Jerusalem, our eternal capital, the holy city for three religions, in whose beautiful streets the past meets the future every single day.@@@There are, however, two major threats hanging over the head of our wonderful country.@@@Those threats also hang over the heads of the members of this Assembly, even though they may try to deny it.@@@The first is the nuclear threat — the fear that terrorist States and terrorist organizations will get their hands on nuclear weapons.@@@The second threat is the demise of truth.@@@Our democracies are slowly being poisoned by lies and fake news.@@@Reckless politicians, totalitarian States and radical organizations are undermining our perception of reality.@@@We should know.@@@There is no country in the world that faces this phenomenon more than Israel.@@@There is no country that has come under greater attack from lies, with such a vast amount of money and effort being invested in spreading disinformation about it.@@@Last May, the picture of Malak al-Tanani, a 3-year-old Palestinian girl, was published all over the world, with the terrible news that she was killed with her parents in an attack by the Israeli Air Force.@@@It was a heart-breaking image, but Malak al-Tanani does not exist.@@@The photo was taken from Instagram and is of a girl from Russia.@@@I can give thousands more examples of similar fake news about Israel.@@@The anti-Israel movement has been spreading these lies for years in the media, on college campuses and on social media.@@@The question is not why they do it, but why the members of this Assembly are willing to listen.@@@Why are they listening to people who have invested billions of dollars in distorting the truth?@@@Why do they side with Islamic extremists who hang gay people from cranes, oppress women and fire rockets at civilians from kindergartens and hospitals?@@@I am not a guest in this building.@@@Israel is a proud sovereign nation and an equal member of the United Nations.@@@We will not be silent when those who wish to harm us use this very stage to spread lies about us.@@@Antisemitism is the willingness to believe the worst about the Jews, without question.@@@Antisemitism is to judge Israel by a different standard than any other country.@@@Conducting this orchestra of hate is Iran.@@@For more than 40 years now, in the town squares and on the streets of Iran, demonstrators have been photographed burning Israeli and American flags.@@@The members of this Assembly should ask themselves: where are the flags are coming from?@@@How did they get so many of our flags?@@@The answer is that they are manufacturing them specially, just so they can burn them.@@@This is what an industry of hate looks like.@@@This is a regime that systematically deals in hatred.@@@It even hates its own people.@@@Young Iranians are suffering and struggling under the shackles of Iran’s regime, and the world is silent.@@@They cry for help on social media and pay for their desire to live a life of freedom with their lives.@@@Iran’s regime hates Jews, women, gay people and the West.@@@They hate and kill Muslims who think differently, like Salman Rushdie and Mahsa Amini.@@@Their hate is a way of life.@@@It is a way to preserve their oppressive rule.@@@There is only one Member State of the United Nations that openly states its wish to destroy another Member State.@@@Iran has declared time and time again that it is interested in the total destruction of the State of Israel.@@@And this building is silent.@@@What are Member States afraid of?@@@Has there ever been a time in human history when silence stopped violence?@@@The country that wants to destroy us is also the country that founded the largest terrorist organization in the world, Hizbullah.@@@Iran funds Hamas and Islamic Jihad and is behind mass terrorist attacks, from Bulgaria to Buenos Aires.@@@It is a murderous dictatorship that is making every effort to obtain a nuclear weapon.@@@If the Iranian regime obtains a nuclear weapon, they will use it.@@@The only way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to put a credible military threat on the table and then, and only then, to negotiate a longer, stronger deal with them.@@@It needs to be made clear to Iran that if it advances its nuclear programme, the world will not respond with words but with military force.@@@Every time a threat like that has been put on the table in the past, Iran stopped and retreated.@@@Today the world is choosing the easy option.@@@It chooses not to believe the worst despite all the evidence to the contrary.@@@Israel does not have that privilege.@@@This time, we are not standing empty-handed against those who want to destroy us.@@@The Jews today have a State; we have an army and great friendships, first and foremost with the United States.@@@We have capabilities and are not afraid to use them.@@@We will do whatever it
takes.@@@Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.@@@We will not stand by while there are those who try to kill us.@@@Not again.@@@Never again.@@@Israel’s economic and military strength enables us to protect ourselves, but it also enables us to strive for peace with the entire Arab world and with our closest neighbours, the Palestinians.@@@An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two States for two peoples, is the right thing for Israel’s security and economy and for the future of our children.@@@Peace is not a compromise.@@@It is the most courageous decision we can make.@@@Peace is not weakness.@@@It embodies within it the entire might of human spirit.@@@War is surrender to all that is bad within us.@@@Peace is the victory of all that is good.@@@Despite all the obstacles, a large majority of Israelis still support the vision of the two-State solution.@@@I am one of them.@@@We have only one condition: that a future Palestinian State will be a peaceful one, that it will not become another terror base from which to threaten the well-being and very existence of Israel, that we will have the ability to protect the security of all the citizens of Israel at all times.@@@If anyone believes that this demand is too much, they should look at the neighbourhood in which we live.@@@They should look at Lebanon, a collapsing State controlled by Hizbullah; at Syria, where a murderous regime massacred half a million of its own people; at Afghanistan, Libya and Iran.@@@We can be asked to live according to the values of the United Nations Charter, but we cannot be asked to die for them.@@@My father was a child in the ghetto, and my grandfather was murdered in a concentration camp.@@@We want to live in peace, but only if it gives us security, not if it threatens us even more.@@@Look at Gaza.@@@Israel did everything the world asked of us, including from this very stage.@@@We left.@@@Seventeen years ago, we dismantled the settlements and took apart our military bases.@@@There is not a single Israeli soldier in Gaza.@@@We even left them 3,000 greenhouses so they could start to build an economy for themselves.@@@What did they do in response?@@@In less than a year, Hamas, a murderous terror organization, came to power.@@@They destroyed the greenhouses and replaced them with terrorist training camps and rocket launch sites.@@@Since we left Gaza, over 20,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel — all of them at civilians, all of them at our children.@@@I have a child with special needs.@@@Her name is Yaeli; she is autistic and does not speak.@@@In May last year, I had to wake her at three o’clock in the morning and run down with her to the bomb shelter because missiles were exploding above our home.@@@All those who preach about the importance of peace are welcome to try running to a bomb shelter at 3 a.m. with a girl who does not speak, try explaining to her, without words, why there are those who want to kill her.@@@We have been asked more than once in this building why we do not lift the restrictions on Gaza.@@@We are ready to do that tomorrow morning.@@@We are ready to do more than that.@@@I say from here to the people of Gaza that we are ready to help them build a better life and an economy.@@@We have presented a comprehensive plan to help rebuild Gaza.@@@We only have one condition, that they stop firing rockets and missiles at our children.@@@If they put down their weapons, there will be no restrictions.@@@If they put down their weapons and let us bring home our children who are being held in captivity — Hadar and Oron, may their memory be a blessing; Avera and Hisham, who are still alive — we will build their economy together.@@@We can build their future together, both in Gaza and in the West Bank.@@@If they put down their weapons and prove that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not going to take over the Palestinian State that they want to create.@@@If they put down their weapons, there will be peace.@@@That is the minimum I owe my grandfather, my father and my daughter.@@@The Jewish people have learned the lessons of the past.@@@Our security is guaranteed by our military might, economic ingenuity and democratic resilience.@@@Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours.@@@We are not going anywhere.@@@The Middle East is our home, and we are here to stay forever.@@@We call upon every Muslim country, from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia, to recognize that and to come talk to us.@@@Our hand is outstretched for peace.@@@Conflicts do not disappear on their own.@@@Hostility does not disappear on its own.@@@People create conflicts; people can also replace them with friendship, kindness and common good.@@@The burden of proof is not on us.@@@We have already proved our desire for peace.@@@Our peace treaty with Egypt has been fully implemented for 43 years now, and our peace treaty with Jordan for 28 years.@@@We are a country that keeps its word and fulfils its agreements.@@@We have proved our desire for peace through the Abraham Accords, the Negev summit and the agreements we have signed with the Arab world.@@@In the Book of Numbers, there is a verse that every Jew is familiar with: “May the Lord raise His countenance towards you and grant you peace” (Numbers 6:26).@@@The State of Israel is the only country in the world founded by a book — the Book of Books, the Tanach.@@@That book and the principles of liberal democracy require us to stretch out our hand in peace.@@@Our history requires us to be clear-eyed and very careful.@@@That is how we have made peace in the past; that is how we will make peace in the future.@@@I bring the General Assembly greetings from the land of volcanoes, surfing, coffee, Bitcoin and freedom.@@@Anyone who has been to El Salvador can easily confirm everything I have just mentioned.@@@Our country is home to the world’s best surfing beaches, volcanoes are everywhere, we have incredible coffee, and anyone can walk around peacefully and safely in any corner of our country.@@@Most of all, we are a united people who is fighting for its freedom.@@@And freedom is precisely what I have come to the General Assembly to speak about from this rostrum.@@@I speak of the freedom for which my people and all the peoples of the world yearn.@@@Talking about freedom is easy, but achieving it requires struggle, perseverance and much sacrifice.@@@I speak of the freedom to choose where we are going and how we want to get there — the freedom to define our own path as human beings.@@@But freedom, like much of what defines us, depends on how others see us and, most of all, on how we see ourselves.@@@The people’s choice of freedom and the respect of the powerful for that freedom are therefore both essential requirements in that regard.@@@I come from a people who for a long time saw themselves as less than others, who never had the courage to make their own decisions, and whose destiny was always controlled by others.@@@The land of my people is the smallest country on the American continent, yet even countries with far more territory, money and power than us do not respect our dominion over that
little piece of land.@@@They are the rightful masters of their own countries, but they are incorrect to think that they are also the masters of ours.@@@The fact is that there is a group of powerful countries that not only have much more than everyone else, but also believe they are entitled to the little that we, the countries without power, have.@@@We can compare that scenario to someone living in a very small and humble house, but who has a very wealthy neighbour, whose house is a beautiful and gigantic palace, with vast expanses of land and unimaginable treasures.@@@The person living in the little house respects and admires her neighbour and does not mind that he is immensely richer than she.@@@She is happy in her little house but decides to make improvements to it, paint it, fix it up and give it better furnishings — quite an undertaking, no doubt, but she is sure it will be worth it.@@@Everything is going well, until the rich neighbour decides that his poor neighbour does not have the right to fix her house, buy new furniture or paint the walls.@@@The rich neighbour decides that in addition to owning his own palace, he can also order around the person in the little house.@@@He orders, without her permission, that everything in the house remain lousy as it was before.@@@On the surface, the poor neighbour has no reason to despise or envy her rich neighbour or to aspire to what he has.@@@She has no reason to plan to go to his palace and order him around or demand that he change his marble floors.@@@But the poor neighbour should at least have the right to clean her own house, repair and paint her own walls, change her own furniture, plant flowers in her own garden and redo her own roof so it is free of leaks and protects her from the rain.@@@That should not bother the rich neighbour.@@@He should not be ordering her to put her old furniture back, cut her flowers, strip the walls, remove the new roof, which is functioning fine, and put back the old roof — which is all the more aggravating because the leaky roof never worked in the first place.@@@The rich neighbour has no authority to order his poor neighbour to return to the past, first, because he has no claim to be in charge of another person’s house; secondly, because the poor neighbour had tried previously to follow her rich neighbour’s orders and the consequences could not have been worse; and thirdly, because the improvements she made in the first place were actually working.@@@Why should her neighbour force her to go back to the way she was before?@@@For what purpose?@@@To what end?@@@Should he not be happy that his poor neighbour is a little better off than before?@@@That is why I say that freedom is something we are still fighting for in El Salvador.@@@Because although we are free, sovereign and independent on paper, we will not be truly so until the powerful understand that we want to be their friends, that we admire and respect them and that our doors are wide open to trade and tourism so that we can build the best possible relations.@@@But what they cannot do is to come and boss us around — not only because the land is ours, but also because it would not make sense to undo what we are achieving.@@@In a very short time, El Salvador has gone from being virtually the most dangerous country in the world — literally, the most dangerous country in the world — to being on its way to being the safest country in America.@@@We went from being a country that was unknown to many — while the few who knew it, knew it for its gangs, deaths, violence and war — to being a country known for its beaches, surfing, volcanoes, financial freedom and good governance and for having put an end to organized crime.@@@Those achievements, which we have only just begun and have been obtained in a very short time, are immense for us.@@@And we have the right to continue on the path of our development.@@@That is why I initially said that freedom is something we are still fighting for — because our rights to freedom and genuine independence still need to be recognized.@@@I wanted to say these words from the rostrum today because maybe they will resonate not only in my country, El Salvador, but also for the other peoples of the world who, like mine, want the freedom to build their own path.@@@Some will be able to do it sooner and others later.@@@For some it will be easier and for others more difficult.@@@But it will happen much quicker if the powerful countries help us.@@@And if they do not want to help us, they should at least stay out of the way.@@@All peoples should find their own path, and in doing so they will find friends.@@@To those countries, I humbly offer the friendship of my small country, the smallest on the American continent, the country of surfing, volcanoes and pupusas — a country that is still fighting for its freedom but is about to secure it.@@@Three years ago, I spoke here at the United Nations from this very this rostrum (see A/74/PV.7).@@@At that time, I said that this format was already obsolete.@@@Now, three years later, we can see that it has become even more so, but perhaps it still serves a purpose.@@@Perhaps it will serve, among many other things, for me, the
representative of that small country — the smallest on the American continent — to humbly recall that the United Nations was not established to divide, destroy or subdue us, but so that we could relate to one another, work together, build a better community of countries and seek solutions to the problems of the world — but with absolute respect for the sovereignty and self- determination of every country and in the manner set out in the Charter of the United Nations itself, the first principle of which states that the Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.@@@One of the main founding purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.@@@Perhaps the transition from a unipolar world system to a multipolar one, a frequent topic of discussion, would be smoother if instead of moving from one super-Power to several super-Powers, we transitioned to a world in which all peoples were truly free to build their own path and our community of nations — all of us, big and small — would contribute our own experience and capabilities to solving humankind’s problems.@@@No one could be against that, but as with freedom, it is easier said than done.@@@I came all the way here to speak from this rostrum in a format I no longer believe in, to say something that most likely will not change the way powerful countries see others anyway.@@@But perhaps it will change the way that we, as developing countries, see ourselves.@@@If after these short words I have achieved that, at least with a handful of individuals who will go on to see themselves with respect and understand that they are capable of building their own path, then it was worth coming all this way to speak in this obsolete format.@@@And who knows what will happen?@@@Perhaps, in time, other nations — other peoples — will emerge who also decide to fight for their freedom.@@@Then the United Nations will have become relevant again, at least for a humble servant like me.@@@May God bless all the nations of the world.@@@At the outset, let me congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his important duties.@@@We are at a watershed moment in human history, when humankind is facing interlocking challenges that threaten peace, increase the level of poverty and are likely to considerably delay the achievements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@At this particular session, the President’s proposed motto — “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science” — can provide us with some transformative solutions to address them.@@@Multilateralism continues to be under threat, yet there is no other body or entity more representative and likely to strengthen global cooperation than the United Nations.@@@After the past three years of reeling from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we were hoping that the availability of vaccines against COVID-19 would stop bleeding our economy and that we would return to normalcy.@@@Instead, the situation has worsened due to the conflict in Europe, which is having far and wide ramifications around the world.@@@Conflicts and political instability have led to more crises and the human tragedy of war has worsened.@@@Their profound economic impact is slowing growth and exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis.@@@There is uncertainty as to when and how the conflict will end, but what is clear is that the massive influx of funds needed for recovery and reconstruction will necessarily draw from the much-needed assistance to countries seeking to recover from COVID-19.@@@Millions of people will continue to suffer worldwide, and millions more will be left behind.@@@While we are still confronting an uneven recovery of the global economy, the pandemic recovery gap between countries is widening, creating economic and social reverberations around the globe and injecting more uncertainty into global markets.@@@The rising cost of commodities and energy and, in some cases, their scarcity will further weaken our economies and delay the achievement of the SDGs.@@@Small island developing
States (SIDS) like Mauritius, which are highly vulnerable, will be particularly affected.@@@We make an urgent appeal to all players and the international community as a whole to work towards a cessation of hostilities and seek to resolve differences through peaceful means.@@@This is the time when we should be seriously thinking of saving our planet, slowing down the effects of climate change, preventing a worldwide recession and, most importantly, preventing a nuclear catastrophe.@@@We are witnessing more and more extreme weather events; higher-than-ever temperatures, droughts, fires and floods are creating unprecedented challenges across the globe and taking a heavy toll on human life and material damage.@@@I take this opportunity to express my Government’s sympathies and solidarity to the populations affected throughout the world, especially in Pakistan.@@@The twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change gives us another chance to globally agree on and commit to yet unprecedented measures to keep the temperature rise below the 1.5°C target.@@@Our responsibilities as leaders and our state responsibility should guide us in ensuring that our own future and that of our children are secure and refrain from any action that is tantamount to ecocide.@@@Access to climate finance is essential to addressing these existential threats.@@@Mauritius is keen to implement its nationally determined contributions which are estimated to cost around $6.5 billion.@@@Despite the huge costs to our economy, Mauritius has pledged to finance 35 per cent of the projects.@@@We appeal to the international community to support us for the remaining part.@@@The financing needs for development projects in SIDS like Mauritius should be demand-driven and based on the prevailing economic conditions, especially in light of the budgeting stress created by the pandemic.@@@We must also address the inequities and, in that respect, the United Nations development systems, together with our development partners, should use a unified compass and a refined and more comprehensive vulnerability index that accurately captures the vulnerabilities of SIDS so as to prioritize allocation of funds and increase the funding of development activities.@@@Ocean-based economies are being deeply affected.@@@Restoring the health of our oceans is crucial to preserving our biodiversity, community livelihoods and climate resilience.@@@Negotiations for a binding global treaty to end plastic pollution and the consensus reached on banning harmful fisheries are important steps in the right direction to turn the tide and make our oceans healthy for our sustainable development.@@@Mauritius is committed to protecting our oceans and, in this context, it announced during the Lisbon Ocean Conference the creation of a marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago.@@@We invite States, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to support this initiative and assist in the creation, management and enforcement of the marine protected area which, will be among the largest in the world.@@@The world is getting increasingly connected digitally and cyberspace is invading almost all areas of modern day-life.@@@However, while it is providing new opportunities, it is also creating new challenges.@@@The pandemic has brought to light the role of information and communications technology as a crucial enabler of economic and social development, but we need to be cautious about the misuse and abuse of this technology as well.@@@Mauritius’ socioeconomic vision and multicultural and societal values take into account and encourage the pursuit of a secure, and safe digital world for all as we strive to undermine disinformation with accurate information.@@@We strongly value respect for and the promotion of human rights, both online and offline.@@@We are equally keen to protect human values, promote tolerance and avoid hate speech.@@@In this respect, we support the efforts of the international community to elaborate a comprehensive international convention on countering the use of information and communications technology for criminal purposes.@@@The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in its totality is to the benefit of all, for today’s and future generations.@@@Mauritius strongly believes that we must address the concerns of our Youth for the future.@@@Even though we are constrained by our insularity and limited means, we are striving to increase opportunities for our youth.@@@Providing social protection and promoting social justice remains a key priority of our Government.@@@Despite very difficult economic challenges, we are maintaining our social welfare State, inter alia, by providing free health coverage, free education and basic pension to the elderly.@@@The economic empowerment of women is at the heart of various policies that we have adopted in Mauritius.@@@Our Government programme is paving the way for a society where gender equality is adhered to, ensuring fairness and equity among all, as well as the human and social development of women.@@@In this respect, Mauritius has made significant progress towards achieving gender equality.@@@We reaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian People and strongly condemn the senseless acts of violence against its vulnerable population.@@@The recent development on the world scene is again pointing to the need for us to improve our ability to respond to crises, be they manmade or natural.@@@In this regard, we believe that the United Nations system, particularly the Security Council, needs the necessary reforms to make it more representative of the world today and thereby render it more effective.@@@In that regard, we again reiterate the importance of expanding the Security Council with members of the African continent, based on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, as well as a member from SIDS, amongst others.@@@The fundamental pillars of the United Nations, such as development, human rights and international peace and security, are grounded in respect for and the promotion of international law.@@@This essential bond among States enables the rule of law and global good governance to flourish, without which there would be chaos.@@@When the United Nations and the institutions that we have created to uphold international law are not respected, democratic governance and our universal values are undermined.@@@International Law cannot be applied selectively.@@@It is universal, indivisible and essential to promote multilateralism, international cooperation and strengthen faith in a fair and equitable global order.@@@The Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 25 February 2019, resolution 73/295 and the Judgment of the Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 28 January 2021 have confirmed, with crystal clarity that international law, recognizes the Chagos Archipelago to be and to have always been an integral part of the territory of Mauritius.@@@Yet, despite the aforementioned resolution, which required the colonial administration to withdraw within six months of the date of its adoption, that part of our territory remains occupied today.@@@This situation further delays the implementation of our resettlement programme, especially for those Mauritians of Chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from there in the 1960s.@@@It ill behoves the United Kingdom to call on Mauritius and other African countries to respond to other allegations of illegal occupation when it is illegally occupying a part of Africa.@@@The new Government of the United Kingdom has an opportunity to place itself on the right side of history and bring to a close this dark chapter of history involving the last colony in Africa and the last colony it ever created, as well as the shameful forcible displacement of people.@@@Such a move would be fully consistent with the values and principles of the beloved late monarch, who we honour today and pay homage to.@@@What more fitting tribute could there be to the memory of that great monarch who dedicated her life to service and to upholding the values of democracy, human rights and international law, sovereignty and territorial integrity than to bring this history to an end and to do so in a manner that respects sovereignty, matters of security, environment and the fundamental rights of human beings?@@@We urge the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to act with statesmanship and work with us to implement resolution 73/295 and support the completion of the decolonization of Mauritius and the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago.@@@I wish to report that there have indeed been some attempts to start such a conversation.@@@We reached a point where it would have been possible to agree on a way forward, but it appears that the United Kingdom is having some difficulty in accepting the proposal that any final agreement must be based on international law.@@@It would be most disappointing if the ability to reach a final settlement were scuppered by its unwillingness to express a commitment to respecting the international rule of law — all the more so that Mauritius has over the years confirmed that it is prepared to enter into a long-term lease to protect the continued operations of the military base on Diego Garcia, given its contribution to regional peace and security.@@@Mauritius is deeply grateful for the support it has been receiving from other countries and for actions taken by international and regional organizations, including the United Nations and its specialized agencies, to implement resolution 73/295.@@@We are particularly thankful to the United Nations for amending its world map to include the Chagos Archipelago as a part of
Mauritius; to the Universal Postal Union for ceasing to recognize the so-called British Indian Ocean Territory issued stamps; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for upholding the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion and the General Assembly resolutions; and to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for proceeding to delimit the maritime boundary between Mauritius and Maldives in the region of the Chagos Archipelago.@@@I must, however, deplore the decision of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission, which, at its latest meeting, held in Bali, violated its legal obligations by failing to recognize the legal entitlement of Mauritius, which satisfies all the criteria for full membership of that organization.@@@In that regard, it is with much regret that Mauritius has decided to suspend its participation in future activities of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission until its legal entitlement to full membership of that regional organization is fully recognized.@@@With regard to Tromelin, which also forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we look forward to the early resolution of the dispute over that island in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between Mauritius and France.@@@We have reached a once in a generation moment and we must make critical choices that will determine our future.@@@The vicious cycles of violence must stop; divides and distrust must end.@@@We should not allow the winds of discord to draw the iron curtain closed again; the winds of peace should flow smoothly.@@@Humankind’s aspirations and yearnings for peace are resonating strongly on the world stage.@@@Current geopolitical tensions should be de-escalated.@@@It is time for decisive action and stronger international cooperation.@@@More than ever, the promise to leave no one behind must guide our actions and forward path.@@@It is only by working together that we can begin to weave a stronger and more inclusive global economy and build a better world for our shared prosperity.@@@We can and we must act now.@@@Earlier this year, a young Colombian named Mateo was going about his daily student activities in Eastern Europe.@@@Like many Latin American migrants, Mateo was focused on pursuing his dreams — in his case, a medical degree from Zaporizhzhya National University.@@@One day in February, however, that dream became a nightmare, all because of Russia’s senseless war against Ukraine.@@@As the entire world, flabbergasted, watched the outbreak of a war of dimensions that had not been seen for decades, Mateo had to experience it first-hand.@@@He came in very close proximity to dangerous military actions that I prefer not to discuss today, out of respect for him and his traumatic experience.@@@Relying on his own ingenuity and the solidarity of others, he used various means of transport, including horses, to make his way to the nearest border.@@@Meanwhile, as all of that was going on, Ecuador was establishing a national crisis committee, which fulfilled its objective of repatriating 730 Ecuadorian citizens via humanitarian flights.@@@Mateo, whose sister is Ecuadorian, thereby making him part of a transnational family, was able to board one of those flights.@@@His Colombian parents now live in Ecuador, thanks to protection visas granted by our Government.@@@And Mateo was not the only one — that same story was experienced by several Colombian, Peruvian, Latin American and even Ukrainian citizens who managed to escape the war thanks to the enormous diplomatic effort led by our country.@@@I am relating all of this now because if everyone here takes only one message from me with them today, I would like it to be this — that Ecuador is here for the world and will leave no one behind.@@@That is why I am confident that the world will not leave Ecuador behind when it comes to the challenges we face.@@@When I prepare for events like these, I usually consult with renowned international relations experts.@@@They cite to me the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which speak of the sovereign equality of States; good faith; the peaceful settlement of disputes; territorial integrity and political independence; the non-use of force; full respect for human rights and so on and so forth.@@@Those are all admirable concepts that for almost eight decades have preserved a relative stability that is now being challenged.@@@Nevertheless, I wanted to begin my address by talking about Mateo, a Latin American student who, like thousands of others, was in Ukraine chasing a dream.@@@Those who know me know that I am neither a scholar nor an academic nor a regular speaker at international forums.@@@The reality is that for most of my life, I have cultivated a very simple idea, which is that the only way to create value is to always put people — human beings — first in everything we do.@@@It is always in human beings — in people — that I place my trust, and I want to explain exactly why that is important.@@@I want to explain the reasons why I argue that a people-first approach is vital not only to individual countries but also to building a more peaceful and stable world.@@@I firmly believe that any political institution or system, whether national or international, derives its legitimacy from the good it is able to produce for its citizens.@@@It must not only base its legitimacy on that principle but renew it daily with the consent of the people it serves.@@@Here in this great institution, we are a family of nations, and nations are families of citizens.@@@The welfare of our larger, extended family — as well as its stability and, ultimately, its peace — depends on what happens within each of our smaller, immediate families.@@@Take it from someone who leads a country today where in the past, marginality and neglect have served as breeding grounds for the magic formulas of the most predictable kind of populism.@@@I refer here to the same populism that subsequently takes off the mask and shows its true authoritarian face; the same populism that when it is governing, flirts with dangerous actors who hide beyond the reach of our international institutions to sponsor some of the threats that bring us here today, when we ask ourselves what to do about them.@@@That challenge is multifaceted, but I will always insist that if we want to keep those threats at bay, we must start by shunning the ugly face of authoritarianism.@@@In order to do that, we will always circle back to the need to create opportunities for the
people themselves.@@@We need a world order in which all citizens feel included, connected and represented; an interdependent order where opportunities flow freely from one corner of the world to another.@@@We need to strike a balance whereby it becomes increasingly difficult for aspiring warlords to blame their failures on so-called asymmetries in the world order.@@@We must open the doors of opportunity to more citizens and never again close them behind a false notion of sovereignty that in reality is simply hubris.@@@We need to understand that international security is not a right to simply be demanded, but a duty that we all share.@@@My Government has in fact found itself in a strange position whereby it has had to inaugurate a fight against a threat that in the past was concealed rather than confronted.@@@I am talking about shady actors who, rather than being countered, were quietly accommodated in hopes that no one would detect them.@@@Today Ecuador is engaged head-on in an unprecedented fight against drug trafficking, as evidenced by the latest World Drug Report 2022, which confirms that Ecuador is third in the world among countries seizing cocaine.@@@Today as never before we are increasing our activities to maximize narcotics seizures and dismantle the transnational gangs that transport them.@@@We know that we are not the only ones fighting that monster, which incidentally has not one but several heads, including human trafficking, money-laundering, illegal arms trafficking and even illegal mining.@@@It is estimated that transnational crime is shifting between $1.6 and $2.2 trillion in a year — a figure dozens of times the size of the economy of a country like Ecuador.@@@But it would be a mistake to quantify the consequences of transnational crime in economic terms alone.@@@They must be measured above all in irreparable losses, in lives taken and dreams cut short, in the heartrending cries of the families affected, but also in the fearful silence that they impose on some communities.@@@Just two days ago, in the very centre of the city of Guayaquil, where I was born, a prosecutor was cowardly gunned down by organized crime assassins.@@@He was an official whose investigations included major cases involving transnational mafias.@@@His assassination means not only that Ecuador has lost a servant of the law but also that his children will grow up without a father.@@@His murder teaches us an additional lesson, which is that transnational crime requires a transnational solution.@@@We have two options in that regard.@@@Either we suffer separately, due to a coordinated enemy that acts within several countries to make a mockery of our laws, or we unite to defeat it.@@@Recent events have made it clear that we need even greater collaboration, and I will never tire of insisting on that.@@@Ecuador, with its record levels of drug seizures but also the sacrifices of its servants, has proved that it deserves international help and support in its fight against drug trafficking and to strengthen the institutions where those officers are based.@@@I would also like to take advantage of this forum to appeal for us to work together in the fight against gender-based violence.@@@For Ecuador, the disappearance of a brave woman, a lawyer, a mother and a daughter, should serve as a symbol of the challenge of ending violence against women.@@@Ecuador has shown that it is here for the world, and I am confident that the world will reciprocate that support in those challenges.@@@In terms of human mobility, we have taken decisions that have been applauded.@@@Not only have we maintained our long history as a country of transit, reception and refuge for migrants, we have traditionally been among the States receiving the largest number of refugees in the entire Western hemisphere.@@@And beyond that act of reception, I would like to point to the treatment that those refugees receive once they set foot on Ecuadorian soil.@@@We make special efforts to guarantee the rights and, above all, the integration of migrants, particularly when it comes to families whose countries of origin offer no life alternatives beyond simply fleeing those nations.@@@With half a million Venezuelans living in Ecuador today, we are one of the three principal hosts of migrants from that country.@@@Despite our budgetary difficulties, we provide them with health care, education and other social services.@@@We have also begun a broad regularization process.@@@I would ask everyone here to think about what that means for a small country like ours and then about the impact that a population of that size would have on their own country.@@@That is why I reiterate that Ecuador is here for the world and that I am confident that the world will support us in our regularization plan for our Venezuelan brothers and sisters who have had to leave their country.@@@I have firm hopes that this will be the case, but that is not the only issue at hand.@@@Ecuador is also playing its part in confronting the climate crisis.@@@As a country that emits greenhouse gases, we account for only 0.8 per cent of global emissions.@@@Nevertheless, without hesitation or waiting for anyone to suggest it, my Government took the decision to make Ecuador the first country in Latin America — and only the fourth in the world — to adopt
a cross-cutting policy on our ecological transition, including by elevating it to the ministerial level.@@@Climate change does not ask to what extent we have industrialized in the past but how much we can contribute to the future.@@@That is why, almost a year ago, at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, I announced the creation of the new Hermandad marine reserve in the Galapagos Islands, which increases the protected area of that natural heritage of humankind by 60,000 square kilometres.@@@That was complemented this year by the signing of a declaration for the conservation and management of the ecosystems that make up the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, which was signed with my fellow Presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama to lend a new dimension and political impetus to the corridor’s objectives.@@@That is how we are opening up new opportunities for cooperation, funding and technical assistance for the conservation of biodiversity in Ecuador, the region and indeed the world.@@@But we are going much further — within this very Organization, we have pushed for the mandate of the United Nations Environment Assembly to include the negotiation of a future treaty on plastic pollution.@@@So when it comes environmental conservation, too, Ecuador is here for the world.@@@In each of the issues I have outlined and in each of the challenges and unknown scenarios that the future holds, Ecuador believes firmly that we will find the answers within ourselves, given our recognition that as human beings who share this Earth, what we have in common is far greater than what divides us.@@@We may even be unaware that we hold in our own hands the keys to solving the problems faced by other peoples or individuals.@@@In fact that is what happened to Mateo, the student we were able to rescue from Ukraine.@@@If we apply that way of thinking to every challenge and if we only dare to approach every threat from a united perspective, I know that we will be able to go much further.@@@Take, for example, the food crisis, which has been aggravated by the conflict in Ukraine and has exacerbated malnutrition in many countries.@@@International figures show that 52 million children under five are suffering from malnutrition, 17 million from severe malnutrition and 155 million from stunted growth.@@@In Ecuador, the disease affects almost 30 per cent of children under the age of two, and in some even more tragic cases, some of our poorest provinces are seeing malnutrition rates of more than 35 per cent.@@@My Government has been a pioneer in tackling that problem.@@@We have created a technical secretariat, Ecuador Grows without Child Malnutrition, and set a very clear goal of reducing child malnutrition by six percentage points during my term of office and institutionalizing the process so that future Governments can continue that endeavour.@@@To that end, we have encouraged the participation of civil society, academia, the private sector and local Government.@@@But we can go much further if we only dare to think as a global community.@@@It is no secret that Ecuador’s lands can be extraordinarily fertile and productive when they are sown with optimism and dedication.@@@We are the country of cocoa, bananas and shrimp, but also of dragon fruit, avocados and many other agricultural products.@@@It makes no sense that our children, or those anywhere else in the world, should suffer from hunger in any context — even less so when the land is there, ready to be harvested not only for food but also for opportunities.@@@Today’s new Ecuador offers advantages that can serve not only to alleviate hunger but to create a more stable and peaceful world, where citizens are increasingly included each day through the creation of opportunities.@@@That is the world I see and the world that Ecuador proposes.@@@Finally, as former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said, peace is a way of being, of relating to others and of living on this planet.@@@It cannot be decreed solely through treaties.@@@It must be nurtured through the dignity, rights and capacities of every man and woman.@@@I believe that those words, in a nutshell, encapsulate the spirit of what I have said today.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to express Ecuador’s support for the leadership of the current Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres.@@@I would like to conclude by thanking all Member States for their overwhelming support for my country’s election to be a member of the Security Council for the 2023-2024 term.@@@We will undertake our membership in a context in which humankind is experiencing a period of great uncertainty and exceptional challenges.@@@But I want to assure the Assembly that Ecuador will be here as always, doing its duty for the world.@@@We will conduct ourselves with coherence and transparency and with an emphasis on supporting humanitarian assistance, peace operations, the protection of civilians in situations of armed conflict, the women and peace and security
agenda and the fight against arms trafficking, all while addressing emerging threats in the context of sustainable peace efforts.@@@In every decision, every mediation and every opportunity to contribute to the peace and stability of our planet, the President can rest assured that Ecuador will be here for its fellow Member States and their citizens.@@@Ecuador will always be here for the world.@@@I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his unanimous election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in his work.@@@We have no doubt that the seventy-seventh session will play an important role in boosting the social and economic recovery of the countries of the world in the post-pandemic era, implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, combating climate change and desertification and determining ways to resolve international crises and conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means.@@@Last year we celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of Mongolia’s full-fledged membership in the United Nations.@@@This year we are observing the thirtieth anniversary of Mongolia’s declaration of its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free zone and the twentieth anniversary of Mongolia’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@On behalf of my country and my people, it is therefore a great privilege for me to state from this rostrum that, during those six decades, Mongolia has been a responsible member of the United Nations, actively participating and cooperating in multilateral efforts within the international community, making tangible contributions to global peace and security and promoting the well-being and development of humankind.@@@The whole world is going through difficult ordeals and challenges, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and pandemic-related hurdles with regard to customs, transport and logistics, price increases and inflation, as well as geostrategic and geopolitical tensions.@@@According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, even in these difficult times, when the countries of the world were closing their borders and imposing restrictions and quarantines in order to protect the lives and health of their citizens from the COVID-19 pandemic, often triggering economic crises, global military expenditures continued to grow in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $2.1 trillion.@@@If that huge budget and funds spent on the military and armaments had been dedicated to the least developed and developing countries, how many millions of children’s futures would have been brighter, how many millions would have been lifted out of poverty, how many millions would have been freed from hunger and disease, how many millions would have had food and opportunities for education and employment and places to live?@@@It is time for all of us to ponder and reflect upon what progress could have been achieved if that colossal sum of money had been spent on the pressing issues of combating global warming and climate change.@@@It is truly regrettable that the situation in the world is deteriorating and that mistrust and misunderstanding are deepening even though humankind has suffered enough in the twentieth century due to the scourge of the two World Wars, the Cold War divide, interreligious conflicts and terrorism, among other things.@@@In today’s complex reality, we should therefore always strive to learn from the mistakes of the past, build mutual trust, understanding and respect and make every effort to resolve every misunderstanding, conflict or war by peaceful means and dialogue.@@@Eight centuries ago, our ancestor — the Great Genghis Khan — united all Mongolian dwellers, founded the great Mongolian State under the power of the eternal blue sky, put an end to the centuries-long wars and conflicts, brought peace to the West and East under the rule of justice and established the Pax Mongolica in the vast terrain of Eurasia.@@@Scholars and researchers around the world view the establishment of the Pax Mongolica as an important contribution of Mongols to world history and the advancement of humankind and emphasize that the Pax Mongolica played an important role in the development of free trade between countries, laid the foundation for diplomacy and exchange of envoys, as well as proclaimed the ideas of religious freedom and the rule of law without imposing one’s culture and religion on others.@@@The General Assembly resolution entitled “Eight hundred years of Mongolian statehood”, adopted in 2005, touted the contribution of Mongols to the history of humankind and recognized that “nomadic civilization influenced, inter alia, societies across Asia and Europe and, in turn, absorbed influences from both East and West in a true interchange of human values” (resolution 60/16, fifth preambular paragraph).@@@It further recognized “the important role played by a strong and persistent nomadic culture in the development of extensive trade networks and the creation of large administrative, cultural, religious and commercial centres” {ibid., sixth preambular paragraph).@@@Finally, it acknowledged the “ever-increasing significance and relevance of a culture of living in harmony with nature, which is inherent in nomadic civilization, in today’s world” {ibid., seventh preambular paragraph).@@@That indicates that the Pax Mongolica contained progressive ideas that would form the basis of the collective efforts of the international community to maintain peace and stability in the modern world.@@@Therefore, we, the descendants of the founders of the Pax Mongolica, call on the international community to understand each other, cooperate and manage every conflict through peaceful dialogue so that our blue planet can be at peace and a “Pax Globalica” can be established.@@@We further call on people of the world to combine efforts to achieve that noble goal.@@@Mongolia has consistently pursued a peace-loving, open, multipolar and independent foreign policy.@@@During his official visit to Mongolia in August, Secretary-@@@General Antonio Guterres used the phrase “a symbol of peace in a troubled world” — a clear recognition of that policy by the international community.@@@Mongolia has actively participated in the promotion of international peace and security and in peacekeeping efforts and has put forward several proposals and initiatives.@@@One notable example is the declaration of its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.@@@In his statement at the opening of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in August, the Secretary-General warned that humankind is just “one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation”.@@@In that connection, I urge not only States Parties to the treaty but all States Members of the United Nations to exert political will and courage to build a world free of nuclear weapons and to unite and work together wholeheartedly and faithfully for the sake of our Mother Earth, peace and future generations.@@@Mongolia believes that nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones are the best and most effective means of building a world free of nuclear weapons.@@@We therefore consider that international recognition of Mongolia’s nuclear- weapon-free status is our tangible contribution and effort to this cause.@@@This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Mongolia’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@During that period, more than 20,000 Mongolian military personnel served in United Nations and other international peacekeeping operations in hotspots around the world.@@@Mongolia sent its first female officer to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in 2006, and now we are ranked among the top 20 of 120 countries in number of female peacekeepers contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@Mongolia is firmly committed to the implementation of the resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and to the call by the United Nations Department of Peace Operations to increase the number of women serving in the United Nations peacekeeping operations to 15 per cent by 2027.@@@Within the framework of that objective, at my country’s initiative, we hosted an international conference on strengthening the role of women in peacekeeping, in June.@@@The conference, which brought together female peacekeepers from more than 30 countries and representatives of international organizations, became a notable event for sharing
and exchanging knowledge, experience and lessons learned.@@@We also put forward an initiative to host that conference every five years, and it is our hope that the relevant United Nations entities and troop-contributing countries will support that proposal.@@@At the same time, it is my pleasure to underscore that the United Nations and its leadership have greatly appreciated the genuine contributions of peace-loving Mongolia to United Nations peacekeeping operations and the sacred cause of strengthening international peace and security and have given full support to our proposals and initiatives.@@@Mongolia has consistently proposed the establishment of a dialogue mechanism with a view to contributing to peace and security in North-East Asia and to efforts of the international community to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.@@@In that context, in 2013, Mongolia launched the initiative to organize the international conference “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security”.@@@In June, we organized the seventh international conference of the “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security” and discussed a broad range of issues, including regional security, the power grid, green development, opportunities for humanitarian cooperation and the post-pandemic economic recovery.@@@The results of the conference demonstrate that the significance of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue initiative has grown, and it is transforming into an open and inclusive mechanism gathering Government officials and academia from countries in the subregion and beyond, as well as representatives of international organizations.@@@In the face of frequent natural disasters and communicable diseases, the creation of an integrated regional infrastructure for disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance is becoming one of the most pressing security issues in North-East Asia.@@@With that in mind, in 2018 Mongolia put forward an initiative to establish an integrated platform for disaster risk reduction for the North-East Asia region, and now we present a proposal to establish a regional humanitarian hub or warehouse based on the Ulaanbaatar International Airport-affiliated facilities.@@@I am confident that those initiatives will be supported and assisted by other countries of the region, as well as by the United Nations system and specialized organizations.@@@Broad-scale economic restrictions and sanctions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have hit national economies hard.@@@The global market prices for food, fuel, agricultural products, energy and raw materials have increased sharply like never before, causing fluctuation in the global economy and financial markets and creating major risks.@@@With the immediate support of the United Nations and its system organizations, as well as that of development partners, for Mongolia’s efforts to fight COVID-19, as of today 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, domestic restrictions have been removed and borders have been opened.@@@Although we are going through an uneasy period, the Government of Mongolia is implementing the new recovery policy developed in harmony with the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The policy focuses on improving road, railway and border infrastructure; increasing energy sources; boosting industrialization, as well as urban and rural development; and enhancing public-private partnership and productivity.@@@Furthermore, despite tough times of the pandemic and new normal, Mongolia is making efforts to accelerate the digital transition and adopted a package of new laws on digital development.@@@We introduced the e-Mongolia platform in order to streamline public-service delivery to citizens and entities, to reduce corruption and bureaucracy, to increase information security and to promote good governance.@@@Moreover, we are working to expand and develop our multilateral cooperation in those fields at regional and international levels.@@@Mongolia fully supports the major initiatives put forward in the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and is sparing no effort to implement them alongside the Sustainable Development Goals, the national Vision-2050 long-term development policy and the New Recovery Policy.@@@We must not forget that the serious challenges we are facing, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, land degradation, shortages of water resources and droughts, are still awaiting solutions.@@@Mongolia is one of the countries most affected by climate change.@@@Therefore, with a view to combating climate change, desertification and dust storms and in order to increase forest and water resources, Mongolia launched the Billion Trees national movement in order to plant, grow and protect billions of trees.@@@The Mongolian people, its Government and our development partners
welcomed that initiative, and now the Billion Trees national movement is being successfully implemented throughout the country.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Secretary-General has personally joined and supports the movement.@@@In addition, Mongolia reiterates its commitment to actively cooperate and make a real contribution to reducing the negative impact of climate change and protecting the environment at regional and international levels.@@@In that context, it is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that Mongolia will be hosting the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, in 2026.@@@Another issue that should be brought to the attention of the General Assembly is the scarcity of pastures, as the space for nomadic livestock is shrinking day by day, and nomadic civilization is facing the danger of extinction.@@@We Mongolians are a nomadic and pastoralist people.@@@The lives of more than 200 million people who raise livestock and live in harmony with nature like we do are at risk now due to climate change, land degradation, desertification, drought and extreme winter events.@@@In order to protect their interests, improve pasture management and use, preserve the ecosystem balance and provide global food security and supply, Mongolia initiated a General Assembly resolution proclaiming the year 2026 as International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (resolution 76/253), which was adopted on 15 March 2022.@@@We launched the Billion Trees national movement along with the national programmes Food Supply and Security and Healthy Mongolia in order to help attain the Sustainable Development Goals and create a healthy environment in which people can live a healthy life consuming healthy food.@@@We highly appreciate the support and cooperation that the countries of the region and international organizations extended to those efforts.@@@Nowadays, with the drastic change in the international order and norms established after the Second World War, the importance of multilateralism and the role of the international community are evermore increasing.@@@For that reason, we are of the view that it is important that every Member State take an active part in the process of United Nations reforms and constructively contribute to strengthening the position and role of the Organization.@@@Mongolia is of the view that the key to reforming the United Nations is the reform of the Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@Since 2009, Mongolia has been regularly participating in the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, expressing its principled position.@@@Developments in recent years have shown that the General Assembly is the most important platform for discussing global peace, security, human rights and development issues.@@@We therefore deem that strengthening the role of the General Assembly is important to ensure the balance of power among countries and highlight the voices of small and developing countries more vividly.@@@Lastly, I wish to call on Member States to support the United Nations quintet of change, outlined in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda, for a more effective United Nations 2.0.@@@Let us collectively make efforts to ensure global peace, security, development and prosperity.@@@May the eternal blue sky bless us, humankind, forever.@@@I confirm Latvia’s readiness to cooperate constructively with the President of the General Assembly.@@@Our agenda is full and still growing.@@@In the words of George Orwell, “Contrary to popular belief, the past was not more eventful than the present”.@@@Let me focus today on a few fundamental themes.@@@My first theme is about upholding international law, which is the basis for world peace and the order established by the Charter of the United Nations.@@@At the core of that order is respect for the sovereignty of States and a prohibition on the use of force.@@@Starting a war of aggression is the gravest possible threat to our world peace order.@@@Nevertheless, for seven months, Russia has been waging an unprovoked and unjustified war against a sovereign United Nations Member State, Ukraine.@@@Let me stress that this is not just a regional security issue.@@@Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine is a threat to global security and stability.@@@In the twenty-first century, Russia is maintaining a nineteenth-century ideology of imperialism, colonialism and racism.@@@Russia invaded Georgia in 2008.@@@It illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014.@@@It has used increasingly aggressive rhetoric towards other neighbouring countries.@@@Those are all manifestations of its imperialist and colonial ambitions.@@@Denying another nation’s right to exist and promoting the idea of the supremacy of Russians and their special missionary role in the world are all contemporary expressions of racism, which is exactly the opposite of what the United Nations stands for.@@@Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused a humanitarian disaster.@@@One third of the people of Ukraine have been forced to leave their homes.@@@Russia is preventing Ukrainian-grown food from reaching the world market.@@@Russia is also using its position in the energy market to exert pressure.@@@High energy prices sustain high levels of global inflation, which most dramatically affects the world’s most vulnerable populations.@@@Russia continues to spread false narratives about the causes of the global food, fuel and financial crisis.@@@Those lies must be debunked.@@@Russia alone is responsible for the crisis.@@@We, the law-abiding States Members of the United Nations, are responsible for supporting Ukraine’s self- defence and stopping the aggressor.@@@Russia’s ability to finance its war on Ukraine must be limited.@@@Global sanctions in the areas of finance, trade, transport and energy, as well as restrictive measures against individuals and legal entities, must be maintained and strengthened.@@@Belarus, being equally responsible for enabling Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, is also being sanctioned.@@@Since the beginning of the war, Latvia has spent more than 0.8 per cent of its gross domestic product on military, economic, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.@@@We stand with the brave people of Ukraine, whose heroic defence is seeing success.@@@Today we learned that a partial mobilization has been declared in Russia, as its once-mighty army is overwhelmed.@@@The blitzkrieg envisioned by President Putin has turned into a long nightmare.@@@In another sign of desperation, Russia plans to hold illegal referendums in the next few days on the annexation of the occupied territories to the Russian Federation, which is in blatant contravention of both Ukrainian and international law.@@@Latvia will not recognize the legitimacy of those referendums, or their results, and I urge the international community to do the same.@@@Impunity translates into an invitation to commit further crimes, and the aggressor must therefore be held accountable.@@@The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court have already started proceedings on particular aspects of Russia’s war against Ukraine.@@@The European Court of Human Rights has also initiated proceedings.@@@However, a legal gap remains.@@@No international court has jurisdiction over the main issue — starting a war of aggression, the gravest possible violation of the Charter of the United
Nations and international law.@@@I therefore call for the establishment of a special tribunal, whose main task would be to investigate the Russian State’s responsibility for the commission of the crime of aggression.@@@After the war, Russia will have to pay reparations to Ukraine for damages.@@@The tribunal could be part of an international reparations mechanism and could be established through the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly, by another international organization or a group of like-minded States.@@@Let me now turn to the issues of sustainable development and climate change.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our common road map for overcoming our challenges and creating future-oriented, sustainable and inclusive policies.@@@This year Latvia submitted to the United Nations its second progress report for the Sustainable Development Goals, highlighting the areas of education, gender equality, youth participation and international cooperation.@@@The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is also the overarching goal of Latvia’s development cooperation policy.@@@Over the past 30 years, Latvia has developed expertise in democratic processes, good governance, socioeconomic change and gender equality.@@@Good governance, especially strengthening the rule of law and democracy, accounts for more than 40 per cent of all the support provided by Latvia.@@@As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, we are sharing our expertise in societal resilience.@@@Joint efforts must also be continued to address the consequences of climate change, including through development cooperation efforts.@@@For example, in Central Asia, we have been working on the promotion of clean energy technologies.@@@The problem of global justice is particularly related to climate protection.@@@Latvia supports the view that the greatest polluters should bear a greater burden for that protection.@@@We therefore advocate for greater justice and solidarity regarding the global agenda.@@@We are convinced that digitalization is one of the most important agents of change.@@@Latvia supports innovative and proven digital solutions that promote the efficiency of public administration, public participation in decision-making and the creation of new economic opportunities.@@@In that regard, I would like to highlight the areas of security and fundamental rights in the digital space, which is an integral part of our lives and has enormous potential to contribute to the sustainable development of nations.@@@We must therefore resist attempts to turn it into a battlefield where international law is flouted and basic rights are ignored.@@@The use of people’s data in ways that are incompatible with their human dignity, rights and security must be prevented.@@@The Internet must be open, free, reliable and secure.@@@We support the proposal made by the Secretary- General in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) to agree on a global digital compact aimed at reducing the digital gap between developed and developing countries.@@@Both the coronavirus disease pandemic and current geopolitical challenges highlight the need to strengthen society’s resilience by combating disinformation, promoting media literacy and strengthening media freedom.@@@Accordingly, Latvia is actively preparing for the upcoming eleventh Global Media and Information Literacy Week.@@@Critical thinking skills build up our immunity to disinformation.@@@The aggression by a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State is undermining the basic principles of the multilateral system that we have been building for decades, a situation that once again confirms that meaningful reform of the Security Council is essential.@@@As a firsttime candidate for membership in the Security Council in the 2025 elections, Latvia takes the responsibilities of membership very seriously.@@@We will strive to make the Council more effective, accountable, coherent and transparent.@@@Latvia supports a more just and equitable representation of Member States, especially those in Africa.@@@The Baltic States have much to contribute to the work of the United Nations.@@@For us, the horrors of war, occupation and harsh rule by a colonial Power are within living memory, as is the fight for liberty and restored independence and a transition to a successful, sustainable economy and the rule of law.@@@We have no wish to dominate or intimidate anyone.@@@We reject the idea of spheres of influence.@@@As smaller States, we have an existential interest in effective multilateralism.@@@Latvia will therefore continue to contribute to the work of the United Nations in a spirit of optimism and determination.@@@It is an honour for me to be here among Member States at the General Assembly for the first time.@@@I come from Chile, which is a beautiful country located in the extreme south of Latin America between the Andes Mountains, the backbone of our continent, and the majestic and imposing Pacific Ocean.@@@It is a country that has a varied geography and stirring landscapes, where the clearest skies coexist with the stormiest seas and the driest desert with cities carved by rain.@@@As some of those present perhaps know, the Chilean people are hard-working and supportive.@@@Thanks to their efforts, in just over two centuries we have gone from being Spain’s poorest colony in Latin America to being an independent, free, sovereign and thriving country, which today, with its tremendous opportunities, is on the threshold of comprehensive development, and we are working to ensure that this is for everyone and not just for a few.@@@Chile has copper and lithium for electromobility and is a developing innovative corridor country, promoting clean energy to the world, with long coasts and protected marine areas to safeguard the environment and with top-level universities to foster and share knowledge.@@@I have come to tell colleagues that Chile needs the world, and that the world also needs Chile.@@@But as Member States know and as has been clear in the addresses before mine, we live in a time of deep uncertainty and upheavals, in which it is clear that there is no nation among all those represented here that is isolated from, or immune to, shocks and what is happening globally.@@@Our country is certainly no exception.@@@The unfair war of aggression that Russia unleashed on Ukraine, with whose people we express our solidarity, pushed up fuel prices and caused shortages of grains and fertilizers, with a strong impact on our economy and that of many States.@@@In addition, while it is harder to talk about, the trade war between the United States and China, unleashed under the Trump Administration in 2018, as well as the pandemic destabilized the global economy, affecting our economy as well as that of other Member States.@@@At another level, the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, as a result of its already prolonged political crisis, has generated an unprecedented migratory flow in our region and our country, putting tremendous pressure on our institutions and society.@@@Finally, as many Member States are clearly experiencing, the climate crisis has a particularly strong impact on our Latin American continent, and especially the Caribbean, as well as the livelihoods of our people.@@@In Chile, we meet seven of the nine vulnerability criteria established by the United Nations: low-level coastal areas, arid and semi-arid areas, forests, propensity to natural disasters, droughts, polluted urban areas and fragile mountain ecosystems.@@@However, our country, no doubt like many Member States present and a large part of the global South, produces and is responsible for a tiny share — in our case 0.24 per cent — of global greenhouse-gas emissions, while the countries with the biggest economies, the Group of 20, as the Secretary-General recalled, produce 80 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@As is evident, these days no country, whether big or small, weak or powerful, can expect to save itself on its own.@@@While we were preparing this speech, I was thinking about how, among so many clearly interesting statements regarding the specific reality of each country, we could contribute a grain of sand to the building of the fairest possible world.@@@Aware of the fact I am not the one to give lessons on each of the problems of the turbulent world in which we live, I thought that relating our recent experience as a country could help those who want to listen to learn from it.@@@Chile is currently undergoing an intense political process.@@@Almost three years ago, we faced a serious political and social crisis.@@@During those days, a great majority of Chileans expressed their unease about the inequality and mistreatment, their indignation at the long waits for public health care, their disgust at the millions of dollars in student debts and their rejection
of meagre pensions after long years of work.@@@That is perhaps a familiar story for many of those here.@@@In a few months, it will be 50 years since President Salvador Allende, from this very rostrum where I have the honour to be today, gave an account of the important social and political changes that our country was undergoing (see A/PV.2096).@@@We are a country that has long been searching for its own path to dignity.@@@While poverty has been significantly reduced and there has been significant progress on social issues during the democratic Governments of the past 30 years, it is undeniable that the development model adopted in Chile has preserved a high degree of wealth, making us one of the most unequal countries in the world, which grieves us.@@@As clearly also happens in many developing countries, that inequality has not only hindered our path to development but is also a potential threat to democracy, since the fracture in society destroys social cohesion, thereby hampering our understanding of each other and our building together a freer and fairer future.@@@The social upheaval that Chile experienced in 2019 perplexed many observers, including some represented here, who were asking what had happened in the country, as well as actors in national life.@@@Many were struck by the fact that a country that had achieved significant levels of economic growth and human development, showing significant improvements in the quality of life of its population, was at the same time faced with such a profound crisis.@@@Unfortunately, what happened in my homeland was not accidental, but the consequence of countless stories of pain and procrastination that were brewing and affecting the very heart of our society.@@@I want to say that, even if it is not expected, that can also happen in the countries of other Member States.@@@That is why I ask that we, together, be proactive in the pursuit of greater social justice.@@@A better distribution of wealth and power must go hand in hand with sustainable growth.@@@I am deeply convinced that, with the participation of Member States, it is possible, and it is an urgent need.@@@Regrettably, I must say this today because each of us cannot come and just talk about good things.@@@That discontent also expressed itself in serious incidents of violence, such as fires in metro stations and the vandalization of civic buildings.@@@Meanwhile, we witnessed uncontrolled repression, which resulted in deaths, injuries and more than 400 people suffering eye injuries as a result of the State’s action, which, in the view of our Government and various international organizations, represents a serious human rights violation that must be redressed, and it will be.@@@It was that long history of injustice that manifested itself in our country from October to December 2019.@@@But — and this is the good news — history lasts longer than those of us who today hold these positions and the long history of citizen mobilization and social struggles, which enabled the return to democracy and the reunion of democrats, as President Aylwin said at the end of the previous century, and which at the dawn of the twentieth century allowed progress in workers’ rights.@@@In the peaceful protests of 2019, there were also women from the previous century who, despite everything, advanced women’s right to vote.@@@The memories of the workers who achieved the right to rest and the settlers who fought, and continue to fight, for decent housing accompanied us.@@@All those memories and social struggles were present.@@@The values behind that deep discontent — equality, justice and freedom — are not unrelated to a demand that we see increasingly frequently around the world and from this rostrum.@@@The protection and promotion of human rights everywhere and by every Government, decent work, universal social protection and the fight against the climate crisis are today universal demands that are the focus of Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), led by our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, and the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The way forward for a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in our country was an important agreement between the main political forces that developed a path towards the drafting of a new constitution, capable of laying the foundations of a new social contract.@@@That path, driven by Chilean society from protest and social struggle and politically channelled by various institutions, was endorsed by a plebiscite, where 80 per cent of voters supported a new constitution, to be written by a specifically elected body.@@@The challenge is not a small one.@@@It consists of achieving, as never before in our history, a democratic constitution, drafted with the participation of citizens and indigenous peoples and gender parity — a constitution for all, but also made by all.@@@A few weeks ago, the work accomplished by the Constitutional Convention between 2021 and 2022 was submitted to citizen consultation by means of a plebiscite, in which Chileans participated on a massive scale, with 85 per cent participation.@@@In that electoral event, we citizens clearly rejected the proposal by 62 per cent versus 38 per cent.@@@Today, as a country, we are therefore looking for new formulas to build this meeting place for all Chileans.@@@My personal decision in the plebiscite was to vote for the proposal for a new constitution, but the result was the opposite.@@@Some saw the result of the plebiscite as a defeat for the Government.@@@In all humility, I wish to say to them today at the United Nations that a Government can never feel defeated when the people speak out.@@@In a democracy, the people’s word is sovereign and is the guide at all times.@@@Why am I talking about this?@@@Because, unlike in the past, when differences in Chile were resolved by blood and fire, today we Chileans agree to overcome our challenges democratically.@@@I am talking about this because I am sure that one of the main challenges for humankind today is building democracies that truly speak and listen to the people and achieve the desired results.@@@Those of us attending this Assembly have the duty to improve our democracies.@@@Ms. Kamina Johnson Smith (Jamaica),
Vice-President, took the Chair.@@@During the many days of mobilization, the word dignity resounded.@@@The Chilean people expressed themselves, giving us a lesson in democracy, which we are learning.@@@Chile has called on its democracy and its political actors to rise to their demands and the challenges of today, which we too must meet.@@@As a Government, we received the results of the recent plebiscite with our eyes and hearts wide open.@@@We want to hear what the people are telling us because we trust in their judgment and their will.@@@There are things that we understood very clearly, which I want to briefly share.@@@The results are the expression of a citizenry that demands changes without jeopardizing its current achievements and that wants a better future, built seriously and without succumbing to new insecurities — a future of change with stability.@@@As a young person who not long ago was protesting on the street, I can say that representing unrest is much easier than providing solutions for it.@@@Those of us devoted to the demanding work of politics often easily confuse our successes as spokespeople for citizen annoyance with our real capacity to be builders of better futures.@@@The outcome of our country’s plebiscite has taught us to be humbler — democracy should be humble — and to realize that, in building the Chile of which we dream, no given sector has the recipe.@@@Rather, it is a mixture, combining the best that each of us can contribute.@@@In the twenty-first century, we govern by mobilizing the capacities and wisdom of our societies, not by trying to replace them.@@@As President of Chile, I am convinced that very soon Chile will have a constitution that satisfies us and makes us proud, built on democracy that brings together the contributions of all sectors of society and is able to reflect our aspirations for justice and liberty.@@@From the humble history of my country, I can say with deep conviction that the path to overcoming the problems that afflict our societies is paved with more democracy, not with less, encouraging, and not limiting, participation, fostering dialogue, never censoring it, and, above all, respecting those who think differently, including their points of view and understanding that having different opinions does not make us enemies.@@@I rebel against the chasm that some try to dig around legitimately diverse views.@@@We in Chile declare our will to be builders of bridges across such gaps, which prevent us from seeing ourselves as diverse societies.@@@That is the experience and learning that, from our small country, we want to share with the nations of the world.@@@Deepening democracy is an ongoing exercise, in which we can only persevere and each learn from the experience of others.@@@In conclusion, I therefore call on Member States to work together to strengthen democracy in all spaces, in every country and in relations among us.@@@In Latin America, we need a united voice and more common work by the global South.@@@We need a modernized United Nations, where we all have the same goals,
Based on multilateralism, justice and peace at all times and in all places, we must commit to taking the necessary actions, not just making statements, so as to stop Russia’s unjust war on Ukraine and put an end to all abuses by the powerful everywhere in the world.@@@We must commit to mobilizing our efforts to stop violence against women, be it in Iran in memory of Mahsa Amini, who died at the hands of the police this week, or anywhere in the world.@@@We must
commit to not normalizing the ongoing human rights violations against the Palestinian people by upholding international law and the resolutions adopted by this very Assembly that support their inalienable right to establish their own free, sovereign State, as well as to ensuring Israel’s legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognized borders.@@@We must commit to continuing to work for the release of political prisoners in Nicaragua and to ensure that nowhere in the world can having ideas that differ from those of the Government in power end in persecution or human rights violations.@@@The whole world is calling for change and, like those before us, we, as part of the new generations, have the right and responsibility to think about and realize a different future.@@@Citizens who suffer the most from the consequences of societies built on segregation and abuse demand rights and a safe life.@@@We can achieve that world of greater well-being only through increased democracy.@@@That is the call that today we must all heed.@@@In Chile, we are ready to collaborate in every part of the world to that end.@@@After two years of absence due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it is an honour once again to take part in person in the General Assembly.@@@I would like to start this address by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also thank him for the motto he has chosen — “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science” — which we shall assume as our own and which is aligned with the principles applied in Andorra, from both a domestic and an international political perspective.@@@He may rely on Andorra’s loyal support for the seventy-seventh session, and we wish him every success.@@@Please allow me also to express my acknowledgement of the presidency of Mr. Abdullah Shahid and of the innovative and action-oriented initiatives he has encouraged over the course of a year, in which there has been no shortage of challenges.@@@These have once again emphasized the essential role of the United Nations and the multilateralism it embodies.@@@A year ago, when the COVID-19 pandemic was still very much determining the social and economic policies of many countries, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned us that the global and multidimensional crisis generated by COVID-19 once again underlined global fragilities and structural inequalities.@@@Global governance neither knew how to respond nor provided the appropriate means for vaccines to reach all countries, which left millions of people in a situation of extreme
vulnerability.@@@I take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his excellent work in what remains a very delicate context, which, unfortunately, has many points in common with the reasons for which the United Nations was founded,
Indeed, today the world continues to experience a succession and accumulation of different crises, accentuated by the devastating impact on the planet of an economy that is nearing the end of its cycle and that has based its productivity on excessive use of raw materials.@@@The planet is exhausted, and the symptoms are all too evident.@@@The climate emergency is being felt in the form of heat waves, wildfires, water shortages and extreme phenomena that lead to catastrophes.@@@The planet’s triple crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution affects everyone.@@@We now have the last opportunity effectively and forcefully to address the climate crisis, which is the most global and important challenge we are facing.@@@Unfortunately, climate change is not the only transnational challenge besetting us.@@@Just as we were starting to discern an improvement in the circumstances created by the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, a clear violation of the United Nations Charter, has exposed cracks in the international order and corroborated the loss of respect for the common values that sustain our peaceful coexistence and that are the essence, or the raison d’etre, of this Assembly.@@@The conflict is having a devastating impact on the civilian population and causing one of the worst refugee crises on the European continent since the Second World War, which is why Andorra has once again shown its solidarity by welcoming numerous Ukrainian families, to whom it has given the chance to live and to work in our country.@@@That is also what we did in 2018, during the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Syria.@@@As I explained in the political orientation debate held last week in the Consell General — our Parliament— although our voice in the world does not have the backing of a large population, armies, natural resources or a strategic geographical location, it is sustained by the fortitude of principles and values.@@@Those values inspire our model of society and the order by which we would like international relations to be governed.@@@The impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, moreover, is not limited solely to our region.@@@The threat of a food crisis due to a shortage of distribution of agricultural resources on other continents has required negotiations to prevent it.@@@The energy crisis and rising prices are also generating economic difficulties beyond Europe, which need to be rectified.@@@The situation is not hopeful, yet we should not allow it to bring an end to real politics — politics that make what is necessary possible.@@@We cannot allow unilateralism to prevail over multilateralism.@@@This is how we understand it in Andorra, because a world without international rules or consensus would be a world governed by the law of the strongest.@@@Our adherence to multilateralism is based on the conviction that tackling crises, challenges and common threats requires a strong multilateral system, based on the universal values that inspired the Organization’s founding document,
One may wonder what a country of just over 80,000 inhabitants and a mountainous territory half the size of New York City can do for a planet that will soon have a population of over 8 billion.@@@It is our belief in our ability to set an example and in our role to face global and common challenges based on the responsibility and commitment we assumed 29 years ago when, with the approval of our Constitution, we entered the international scene and joined the United Nations.@@@Andorra believes in multilateralism, its values and its capabilities as an essential way of engagement and of working, to identify challenges, come up with solutions, propose consensus, promote fresh cooperation and keep lines of dialogue and action open.@@@When we are all in attendance, as we are now at the United Nations, we can listen to everyone’s voice and establish truly successful proposals and action.@@@This conviction means that our country is taking and wishes to take an active part in numerous multilateral organizations, as we understand that recovery and change can be achieved only through a spirit of collaboration and by encouraging synergies among peoples, however far apart they may be, in every sense.@@@The year 2023 will, in fact, give the Principality of Andorra an excellent chance to celebrate the multilateral order and to reiterate our firm and constant commitment to that order, as it will be the thirtieth anniversary of Andorra’s joining the United Nations and UNESCO.@@@This anniversary also coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of our Constitution, which will provide an opportunity to familiarize our fellow citizens with multilateral institutions.@@@Throughout our history, geography has shaped our character.@@@Andorra is a high mountain region and therefore particularly vulnerable to climate change.@@@We understand that the impact of this change has unleashed an existential struggle that must be overcome if we are to protect our territory.@@@No issue has ever yielded such consensus among our parliamentary forces — a consensus that has made it possible to create a solid framework for action and continuity.@@@We were one of the first parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to submit a national contribution in 2015, and to update it in 2020, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.@@@The Consell General— our Parliament — unanimously approved the Declaration of a State of Climate Emergency and the Law on Promoting Energy Transition and on Climate Change.@@@We have indeed acted.@@@I shall cite one example.@@@Advances introduced in eco-taxation have led to the creation of a green fund that is allocated entirely to encouraging ecological transition and ensuring that the economic sectors with the greatest environmental impact contribute most.@@@We have pioneered in introducing a green tax and established a carbon price of €30 per ton, which will lead us towards more sustainable mobility.@@@This has practical and clearly beneficial effects for our citizens, as the green fund has enabled us to finance more and better energy efficiency programmes and to become one of the world’s first countries to offer free public transport — a milestone reached just a few months ago, with indisputable success.@@@Another law recently passed, the Law on Circular Economy, is also a remarkable and pioneering initiative that establishes 2035 as the deadline for changing from the current linear production model to a circular production model in which most waste becomes a byproduct that is reintroduced into the production chain.@@@Special emphasis is placed on combating the waste of resources and, specifically, of food.@@@That is because we carefully monitor the reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on the basic issue of the right to food, the second Sustainable Development Goal.@@@We took active part in the 2021 Food Systems Summit, where I had the chance to highlight our fight against food waste and move towards sustainable food systems, which, alongside San Marino, we have had the honour to make a priority policy.@@@Likewise, to mark the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development —and since I have already mentioned the FAO — I would like to refer to the Mountain Partnership and its members, which raise awareness and offer insight, tools and action for the development of mountain regions.@@@Andorra has the highest capital city in Europe, at an altitude of over 1,000 metres, and an average altitude of around 2,000 metres.@@@Mountain regions are of vital importance in natural systems, with their water cycles, influence on the climate, natural resources and biodiversity.@@@Meanwhile, they are highly vulnerable environments.@@@In Andorra, we have therefore been committed for years to caring for our natural heritage and make environmental protection a priority.@@@Most countries have reappraised their actions or observed how some processes of change that were halfheartedly introduced before the COVID-19 pandemic now need to be accelerated, while others require strengthening.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and, over and above that, the common agenda proposed by the Secretary-General are powerful instruments that provide collective and holistic solutions and establish a deadline by which the goals must be achieved in order to build a better world in which human rights, a pillar of the United Nations, are the cornerstone of all of our actions.@@@Andorra, which is firmly committed to the 2030 Agenda, presented its second voluntary national review in July.@@@The report features a detailed analysis of the 17 SDGs and describes the policies being implemented to guarantee Andorra’s sustainable, resilient and inclusive recovery, through the Horizon 23 Action Plan, the Government plan that, following the outbreak of the pandemic, we reformulated for this legislative term, and which ends next year.@@@Globally, COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the progress and achievement of the 17 SDGs.@@@In some cases, we have even strayed from the targets.@@@The achievement of SDG 4, which calls for quality education and the priority objectives of which include the completion of free primary and secondary education for all girls and boys by 2030, is unfortunately far from a reality in many parts of the planet.@@@The education of almost 90 per cent of students around the world was interrupted in late April 2020, which was detrimental to over 1.5 billion children of school age.@@@Many have not set foot in a classroom
since then.@@@The collateral impacts of the pandemic have therefore been particularly intense in the field of education and have highlighted the need to give fresh impetus to schooling.@@@I therefore wish to highlight the Secretary-General’s role in making education one of the core values of the United Nations system.@@@A good example of this is the Transforming Education Summit, which was held in New York on 19 September.@@@There is certainly no better tool for overcoming discrimination and prejudice than giving all children access to schooling, lifelong education and quality education.@@@Our country is fully committed to education as an essential tool for achieving a fairer, more responsible society based on ethical values, critical vision and cooperative and supportive attitudes.@@@Andorra’s educational structure is one of our country’s finest assets, as three plural and diverse public education systems — Andorran, French and Spanish— coexist, thus allowing us to ensure higher levels of tolerance, freedom and democracy in the education of our children and young people.@@@Specifically, multilingualism is one the characteristic, differentiating elements of the Andorran education system.@@@We therefore wish to give our support and commitment to action promoted by the United Nations on multilingualism as a tool for dialogue, communication, exchange and, in short, as a vehicle for peace.@@@We share the Secretary-General’s view of the need for solidarity with the young generations so that they may be involved in decision-making.@@@All Andorran institutions therefore work with young people so they can take active part in political life and are endowed with the skills they need to manage their futures.@@@As political leaders, we are responsible for creating opportunities for future generations, and that is one of the goals that we work hard to achieve so that our country will be able to offer opportunities for progress to new, increasingly well-trained generations and they need not envision a future a long way from home.@@@In our country, we believe that the creation of these new opportunities for the future is an inevitable step in completing the process of economic diversification that we started in 2012 and that, because of the pandemic, we have wished to intensify by prioritizing key strategic sectors of sustainability and of innovation and research.@@@This culmination is linked to the strengthening of our relations with the European Union through an association agreement that we have been negotiating since 2015, which has allowed us progressive, structured participation in the European internal market.@@@It will therefore be possible to promote the internationalization of our companies and encourage mobility among our young people and thus also contribute more to global prosperity.@@@I now wish to mention another global challenge that we have considered and that relates to SDG 5 — achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.@@@Observation everywhere of persistent gender-based violence, a growing number of sexual assaults and murders of women, and increasing job insecurity and wage gap shows that inequality still leads to vulnerability and excludes half of humankind.@@@Feminism is one of the great challenges of the present moment and it is absolutely essential for us to invest all our effort in developing active, determined measures to build a new reality in which the equality of women and men is not only a right, but also a fact whereby the collective imagination cannot conceive of or accept discrimination against women.@@@Last spring, the Consell General — our Parliament—approved a law for the effective application of the right to equal treatment and opportunities and non-discrimination between men and women.@@@It is a pioneering law that provides essential tools for breaking down the invisible barrier that still prevents full equality.@@@Some of the aspects regulated by this law — such as co-education as a guiding principle for the entire education system, the requirement to draw up annual records of gender-related data, a determined commitment to eliminating the wage gap and the coordination of equality plans in companies — are the first of their kind.@@@A year ago, in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), Antonio Guterres delivered the very clear message that the United Nations ability to fulfil the objectives established by its founders depends entirely on the collective political will of all its Members and their commitment to the pillars of the United Nations.@@@That message has been understood, and Andorra fully supports the road map, which urges us to intensify action to strengthen and coordinate the global health architecture, address the climate emergency, renew solidarity among peoples, provide space for youth, and encourage a new social contract on human fights and an approach to global commons.@@@In assuming our
responsibility, we must now work to achieve all this and now have a — I dare say — historic opportunity to do so.@@@We come from a very small country, in which years ago we pledged to do things right and in which everyone can express themselves freely, with an over 600-year-old Parliament, the depository of the people’s sovereignty and in which, for over seven centuries, we have fortunately known only peace.@@@The United Nations may therefore depend on our help, based on the values that have shaped us over history, to defend, globally, a fairer, more equitable world with a more efficient and sustainable economic development.@@@As political leaders, we cannot afford to look back and see how our inaction led to catastrophic and irreversible damage to our planet and to humankind.@@@No individual effort will be enough, but it will be necessary, as the struggle facing us and in which we are now immersed requires everyone to contribute.@@@Andorra is willing to take part and to act with determination to be part of the solution.@@@As I stand here today to tell the story of my country, Pakistan, my heart and mind have not been able to leave home.@@@Standing here, I still feel as though I am visiting one of the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan in my country.@@@No words can describe the shock that we are living through or how the face of the country lies transformed.@@@I have come to explain first-hand the scale and magnitude of that climate catastrophe that has pushed one third of my country under water in a superstorm of a scale that that no one has seen in living memory.@@@For 40 days and 40 nights, a biblical flood poured down on us, smashing centuries of weather records and challenging everything we knew about disaster and how to manage it.@@@Even today, huge swathes of the country are still underwater, submerged in an ocean of human suffering.@@@In that ground-zero of climate change, 33 million people, including women and children, are now at high risk from health hazards, with 650,000 women giving birth underneath makeshift tarpaulins.@@@More than 1,500 of my people have left the world in the great flood, including more than 400 children.@@@Far more are in peril from disease and malnutrition.@@@As we speak, millions of climate migrants are still looking for dry land on which to pitch their tents, with heart-breaking losses to their families, futures and livelihoods, gone for a long time to come.@@@Early estimates suggest that more than 13,000 kilometres of metalled roads have been damaged; more than 370 bridges have been swept away; 1 million homes have been destroyed; and another million damaged.@@@More than 1 million farm animals have been killed; 4 million acres of crops have been washed away, stripping the people of their source of food and resulting in damage of an unimaginable scale.@@@Pakistan has never seen a starker and devastating example of the impact of global warming.@@@Life in Pakistan has changed forever.@@@I have visited and spent time in every corner of my devastated country.@@@People in Pakistan ask why has this happened to them?@@@When global warming rips apart whole families and an entire country at such ferocious speed, it is time to ask, “Why?”@@@And it is time to ask not what can be done, but what must be done.@@@The undeniable truth is that the calamity has not been triggered by anything we have done.@@@Our glaciers are melting fast, our forests are burning and our heat waves have surpassed the 53°C mark, making us the hottest place on the planet.@@@And now we are living through an unprecedented monster monsoon.@@@It is literally a monsoon on steroids, as the Secretary-General described it most befittingly.@@@It is on steroids.@@@One thing is very clear: What happened in Pakistan will not remain in Pakistan.@@@As the Secretary- General has so candidly said, hotspots like Pakistan fall in the 10 most climate-vulnerable list of countries, but emit less than 1 per cent of the greenhouse gases that are burning our planet.@@@It is therefore entirely reasonable to expect some approximation of justice for the loss and damage, not to mention building back better with resilience and strength.@@@Clearly, the time for talk about taking action has passed.@@@At this point, I am profoundly grateful that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Pakistan, where he spent time with climate refugees and mothers and children in tents and repeatedly assured us of his support and assistance.@@@At this point, I want to thank each and every one of the countries that have sent help to Pakistan and their representatives to Pakistan for standing in solidarity with us at our most trying hour.@@@On behalf of my nation, I once again express my sincerest appreciation to all of them.@@@The impacts on the health and wealth of my country are beyond calculation at this point.@@@My real worry therefore is about the next stage of the challenge.@@@When the cameras are gone and have left the Assembly and the story just shifts away to conflicts like that in Ukraine, my question is, will we be left alone, high and dry, to cope with a crisis that we did not create and is not of our doing?@@@Where and how do we begin to rehabilitate and reconstruct after the rescue and relief effort that is still ongoing after 12 long weeks?@@@For many of the lives we have saved, the future is dimmed by new fragility, lost homes, decimated livelihoods, deluged crop-lands, permanent food insecurity and exposure to uncertain futures.@@@Approximately 11 million people will be pushed further below the poverty line, while others will drift to cramped urban shelters, leaving little room for climate-smart rebuilding.@@@For now, we have mobilized all available resources in our domain, squeezing resources from left and right, for the national relief effort, and have repurposed all budget priorities, including development funds, to the rescue and first-order needs of millions.@@@Cash transfers to the most affected — 4 million women heads of household — began weeks ago via our social security programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme, which was established in the name of former late Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.@@@Her son is our Foreign Minister today.@@@We are spending 70 billion rupees, or almost $300 million, out of our own pockets on the Programme, but, at this point, the gap between our urgent needs and available resources is increasing by the day and is amplified by the sheer, unprecedented scale of the disaster.@@@Our manpower and resources are totally overstretched.@@@The question that should be raised here is quite simple: Why are my people paying the price of such a high level of global warming through no fault of their own?@@@We have not contributed to that.@@@Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing.@@@Our actions did not contribute to that.@@@The dual costs of global inaction and climate injustice are having a crippling effect on both our treasury and people, right now and over there.@@@This is going to be a long haul, and, in these most trying circumstances, hope is the best enemy of darkness.@@@Pakistanis are known to be exceptionally resilient people.@@@For my part, I am fully committed and geared to fighting the battle for our survival in the tents and trenches with my people until we have rebuilt Pakistan to face the growing challenges of this century.@@@It is high time we took a pause from the preoccupations of the twentieth century to return to the challenges of the twenty-first century.@@@The entire definition of national security has changed today, and, unless the leaders of the world come together to act now, based on an agreed common agenda, there will be no Earth to fight wars over.@@@Nature will be fighting back, and for that humankind is no match at all.@@@Pakistan’s urgent priority right now is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions of people out of poverty and hunger.@@@In order to enable any such policy momentum, Pakistan needs a stable external environment.@@@We look for peace with all our neighbours, including India.@@@Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia, however, remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.@@@At the heart of that long-standing dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self- determination.@@@India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 to change the internationally recognized disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir and to alter the demographic structure of the occupied territory further undermined the prospects for peace and inflamed regional tensions.@@@India’s ruthless campaign of repression against Kashmiris has continued to grow in scale and intensity.@@@In pursuit of that heinous goal, New Delhi has ramped up its military deployments in occupied Jammu and Kashmir to 900,000 troops, thereby making it the most militarized zone in the world.@@@The serial brutalization of Kashmiris has taken many forms— extrajudicial killings, incarceration, custodial torture and death, indiscriminate use of force, deliberate targeting of Kashmiri youth with pellet guns and collective punishments imposed on entire communities.@@@In a classic settler-colonial project, India is seeking to turn Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu territory, through illegal demographic changes.@@@Millions of fake domicile certificates have been issued to non-Kashmiris.@@@Kashmiri land and properties are being seized.@@@Electoral districts have been gerrymandered, and more than 2.5 million non-Kashmiri illegal voters have fraudulently registered.@@@All this is in blatant violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.@@@For our part, the Pakistani people have always stood by our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in complete solidarity and will continue to do so until, no matter what, their right to self-determination is fully realized in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@I assure the world from this rostrum that we in Pakistan remain consistent in our commitment to peace in South Asia.@@@India must take credible steps to create an enabling environment for constructive engagement.@@@We are neighbours, and we will be there forever.@@@The choice is ours whether we live in peace or continue fighting with one another.@@@Since 1947, we have had three wars, and, as a consequence, only misery, poverty and unemployment have increased on both sides.@@@It is now up to us to resolve our differences, problems and issues as peaceful neighbours through peaceful negotiations and discussions and save our scarce resources for promoting education, health and employment for millions of people, including young boys and girls, on both sides of the divide, not vesting them in buying more ammunition and promoting tension in the area.@@@I believe that it is high time that India understood the message loud and clear that both countries are armed to the teeth.@@@War is not an option.@@@It is not an option.@@@Only peaceful dialogue can resolve the issues so that world will become more peaceful in the future.@@@Afghanistan today presents a unique challenge; 30 million Afghans have been left without a functional economy or banking system allowing ordinary Afghans to make a living to build a better future.@@@Pakistan would also like to see an Afghanistan that is at peace with itself and the world and that respects and nurtures all its citizens, without regard to gender, ethnicity or religion.@@@Pakistan is working to encourage respect for the rights of Afghan girls and women to education and work.@@@Yet, at this point, isolating the Afghan interim Government could exacerbate the suffering of the Afghan people, who are already destitute.@@@Constructive engagement and economic support are more likely to secure a positive response.@@@A peaceful, prosperous and connected Afghanistan is in our collective interests.@@@As a neighbour, Pakistan has a vital stake in peace and stability in Afghanistan.@@@We have led the humanitarian efforts to help our Afghan brothers and sisters.@@@We must avoid another civil war, a rise in terrorism, drug trafficking and a new wave of refugees, whom none of Afghanistan’s neighbours is in a position to accommodate.@@@Pakistan urges the international community to respond positively to the Secretary-General’s appeal for $4.2 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan and release Afghanistan’s financial reserves, which are essential to reviving its banking system.@@@Pakistan shares the key concern of the international community with regard to the threat posed by the major terrorist groups operating out of Afghanistan, especially the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan Province, the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, Al-Qaida, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.@@@They all need to be dealt with effectively and comprehensively, with the support and cooperation of the interim Afghan authorities.@@@In turn, the international community should address Afghanistan’s dire humanitarian needs.@@@Pakistan strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms, shades and manifestations.@@@Terrorism does not have a religion.@@@It is based on dogma, fuelled by poverty, unemployment, deprivation, injustice and ignorance and fanned by vested interests.@@@Pakistan is the principal victim of terrorism.@@@Over the past two decades, we have suffered more than 80,000 casualties and more than $150 billion in economic losses, owing to terrorist attacks.@@@Our armed forces, with the support of our people — mothers, traders, students, teachers, engineers and doctors — have broken the back of terrorism within Pakistan.@@@Yet we continue to suffer from terrorist attacks from across our borders, sponsored and financed by our regional adversary.@@@We are determined to defeat such cross-border terrorism.@@@I must say loud and clear that the number of sacrifices that Pakistan has made to defeat terrorism over that period of time has been unprecedented in its contemporary history.@@@I tell my friends often that if they see a mother or a child limping on the streets of Pakistan, maybe they were the victims of terrorists years ago.@@@That is the kind of sacrifice that Pakistan has made.@@@Our generals, soldiers, doctors, mothers, teachers, students and traders all paid with their lives for Pakistan’s wellbeing and defeated terrorism.@@@And the peace that was restored in Pakistan, after great sacrifice, is not only for Pakistan; it is a peace for countries throughout the world and the global community.@@@We are very proud of it.@@@That is the greatest manifestation of our commitment, concern and continued efforts to defeat terrorism wherever it may be.@@@Islamophobia is a global phenomenon.@@@Since 9/11, suspicion and fear of Muslims and discrimination against them have escalated to epidemic proportions.@@@The officially sponsored campaign of oppression against India’s more than 200 million Muslims is the worst manifestation of Islamophobia.@@@They are subjected to discriminatory laws and policies, hijab bans, attacks on mosques and lynchings by Hindu mobs.@@@I am particularly concerned about the calls for genocide against India’s Muslims by some extremist groups.@@@Earlier this year, the General Assembly adopted landmark resolution 76/254, introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, designating 15 March as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.@@@It is my sincere and ardent hope that that will lead to concrete measures by the United Nations and Member States to combat Islamophobia and promote interfaith harmony.@@@Pakistan is deeply concerned about the numerous conflicts across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.@@@We support all possible efforts to promote their peaceful resolution.@@@We call on Israel to end immediately the blatant use of force against the Palestinian people, the flagrant violations of their human rights and the repeated desecration of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque.@@@The only just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian question is the acceptance of a viable, independent and contiguous Palestinian State, within the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.@@@The Security Council and the General Assembly must be empowered to play their respective roles under the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The Security Council must be expanded by adding 11 new non-permanent members to make it more representative, democratic, transparent, effective and accountable.@@@Adding new permanent members will paralyse the Council’s decision-making, enlarge its representational deficit and create new centres of privilege in violation of the principle of sovereign equality of Member States.@@@The nations of the world must step back from the precipice.@@@We must restore peace in Europe, avoid a war in Asia and resolve festering conflicts across the world.@@@We must revive the vision that created the United Nations, which is often blurred by national interests and hegemonic designs.@@@Pakistan is a partner for peace.@@@But peace can be ensured and guaranteed only when the rights of communities that have been suffering and subjugated for decades get and earn their freedom and are respected.@@@In that regard, before concluding, I will once again say, at the cost of repeating myself, that we want peace with India, but long-lasting, enduring peace can be ensured and guaranteed only through a just and fair solution to the issue of Kashmir, providing rights, including the right to self-determination, to the people of Kashmir in accordance with the Charter and the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@And I will be most forthcoming and ready to sit down and talk to our Indian counterpart to pave the way forward for the future so that our future generations will not suffer and we spend our resources on mitigating misery and building infrastructure to face those threats and outbursts of clouds.@@@We are developing societies.@@@We do not have unlimited resources.@@@We must deploy our resources for the people’s well-being, our children and their development, empowerment, employment, health and education.@@@Of course, other developing societies must find their own place within the community of nations through hard work, untiring efforts and sacrifice.@@@That is the only way forward.@@@Therefore, we will work with all those committed to the principles of the Charter to restore the vision that created the United Nations and to equip the Organization with the capacity to preserve global peace and promote universal prosperity.@@@It is with pleasure that I congratulate you, Mr. President, and your friendly country on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its current session.@@@I wish you success in managing the work of the Assembly.@@@I would also like to express thanks and appreciation to the former President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his efforts in leading the previous session competently and professionally.@@@Let me also express the Kingdom of Bahrain’s appreciation and support for His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his outstanding efforts aimed at reinforcing the role of the international Organization, contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security, protecting human rights, coordinating humanitarian relief operations and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, climate action and environmental protection.@@@The general debate of the current session is taking place amid armed conflicts in most parts of the world and shared economic challenges of extreme importance and danger, which, if left unresolved, together with the increased menace posed by terrorist organizations in various parts of the world — a challenge that has not been comprehensively addressed — would lead to wider conflict and greater destruction, killing, misery, human deprivation and displacement of innocents, thereby threatening the lives of those living in peace, especially women and children, and preventing individuals and societies from enjoying their most basic rights to a dignified and stable life.@@@Those threats impose the necessity of international partnership and joint coordination at bilateral and multilateral levels to end wars and conflicts and resolve them through dialogue and peaceful means, encourage constructive cooperation among great Powers to achieve international peace and security, combat extremism and terrorism by eradicating their financial, organizational and ideological foundations, and addressing any political, economic or social problems that may fuel conflicts, disputes or hatred.@@@My country believes that the only way to resolve existing regional and international crises is through adherence to the principles of the United Nations, most important, respecting sovereignty and international law, not interfering in the internal affairs of countries, achieving consensus on more effective mechanisms to avoid future conflicts, resolving conflicts or disputes before they break out, ending the heavy loss of life and property and channelling financial resources to lift millions of people out of hunger, poverty and illness, instead of wasting wealth on igniting hostility and hatred.@@@In order to avoid or prevent future conflicts, we must do everything in our power to resolve conflicts or disputes before they turn violent.@@@To do that, we must believe in the essential role of promoting the values of tolerance, coexistence, mutual respect and dialogue in trying to prevent the outbreak of conflicts and preserving security and building cooperation and confidence among countries.@@@The United Nations remains a crucial element in supporting dialogue and peaceful coexistence among cultures and civilizations, reinforcing human solidarity in addressing the problems of poverty and hunger, allocating greater resources to assist the least developed countries and the most disadvantaged groups and encouraging scientific research and exchanging experiences in preserving the environment and treating diseases and pandemics.@@@The security and stability of the Middle East region is a fundamental pillar of international peace and security, with this vital and strategic region facing wars and crises that have caused enormous human and economic losses, displaced millions, threatened navigation, trade, energy, water and food security and deprived millions of the young people of the region of hope and optimism for a better and more prosperous future.@@@Under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa, the Kingdom of Bahrain has always stressed, in all its diplomatic stances and effective international responses, the need for international cooperation and partnership on the basis of brotherly relations, understanding and the principles of good- neighbourliness and respect for the sovereignty of countries and non-interference in their internal affairs.@@@We also have always stressed priority for dialogue and diplomatic solutions in settling regional and international conflicts and tensions, and consolidating peaceful coexistence among all religions, civilizations and cultures, based on the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain has prioritized strengthening integration and interdependence among the countries of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) and their sisterly peoples and building on the achievements made in following up on the outcomes of the A1 Ula summit of the GCC.@@@We have been working to fulfil the requirements for achieving economic unity and establishing joint development programmes, as well as the defence and security systems, so as to enhance the security, stability and unity of the GCC countries and their effective role at the regional and international levels.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain is also eager to preserve the security, stability, unity and territorial integrity of Arab countries as integral to its national security.@@@We have confidence in the ability of our sisterly countries to resolve their crises and overcome any differences through political dialogue.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain believes that achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East region depends primarily on settling the Palestinian- Israeli conflict in accordance with the two-State solution, resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@Based on those established principles and values, the Kingdom of Bahrain has undertaken important initiatives such as hosting the Peace to Prosperity workshop and signing the Abraham Accords: Declaration of Peace, Cooperation and Constructive Diplomatic and Friendly Relations, which has entered its third year, embodying the importance of cooperation instead of confrontation and conflict, and working to build trust and partnerships in order to meet the aspirations of peoples for security, peaceful coexistence, prosperity and sustainable development.@@@In that context, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the existing truce in Yemen, with the support and sponsorship of the United Nations, in line with the initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its efforts to reach a comprehensive and sustainable political solution to the Yemeni crisis, in accordance with the GCC Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the Comprehensive National Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216	(2015),	which emphasize the importance of opening all humanitarian corridors and enhancing economic and development support for the Yemeni people.@@@We also stress our support for the legitimate historical rights of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Republic of the Sudan to the waters of the Nile River and for the protection of their water security.@@@We support those countries’ efforts to reach a binding legal agreement on filling and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in a way that benefits all parties, in accordance with the rules of international law.@@@We reiterate our firm stance and solidarity with the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco in preserving its security and territorial integrity, and we value resolution 2602 (2021) on Moroccan Sahara.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain affirms its interest in establishing friendly and balanced relations with all countries in the Middle East region, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, in compliance with the United Nations Charter, international law, the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the affairs of other countries, while respecting international law and the sovereignty of States and their religious and cultural values and refraining from the use or threat of use of force.@@@We call upon Iran to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and work to make the Middle East region, including the Arabian Gulf, a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.@@@Under the wise leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa and the direction of the Government led by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been able to turn challenges into opportunities and success stories, thanks to the team work characterized by responsibility and a united spirit, placing at the forefront of its priorities respect for human rights, human dignity, freedoms, welfare and security, as human beings are the real wealth of the country and the focus and purpose of the comprehensive development process.@@@Team Bahrain represents a pioneering and civilized model in overcoming the repercussions of the coronavirus disease pandemic, as the Kingdom provided free health services and examinations for all citizens and residents without discrimination.@@@We administered nearly 3.5 million doses of vaccines, which is more than 230 per cent of the total population, 67 per cent of whom have also received a booster dose.@@@That is in addition to launching, in March 2020, a financial and economic package worth $12 billion, equivalent to a third of gross domestic product, to support the most affected individuals and sectors and reduce the economic and social repercussions, leading to the Kingdom of Bahrain deservedly being placed first in the world, according to international indicators, in recovery rate, with Manama becoming the first
Healthy City in the Middle East region, pursuant to the World Health Organization.@@@In order to further enhance its development process, the Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to implement an integrated plan for economic recovery that includes the completion of an advanced national programme for employment and training of citizens, updating legislation and commercial procedures to attract foreign direct investment, launching major strategic development projects, modernizing infrastructure, establishing new investment and industrial zones and developing the oil and non-oil economic sectors, along with the shift to the fourth industrial revolution, with support for the digital economy and artificial-intelligence technologies, tourism, logistics and financial sectors, and promoting programmes for financial sustainability, economic stability and fiscal balance.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain is also eager to follow up on its commitments to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and looks forward to presenting its second voluntary report on the implementation of the SDGs next year.@@@Out of its awareness of the interdependence among the environment, natural resources and human, food and water security, the Kingdom of Bahrain has stressed its support for the four major international initiatives in the field of climate change and its commitment to achieving net-zero by 2060, reducing emissions by 30 per cent by 2035, doubling green spaces and enhancing the effective use of energy and renewable energy sources.@@@My country stresses the importance of strengthening international cooperation in protecting the environment and addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable manner, while ensuring energy security.@@@We express our support for the Saudi Green and Middle East Green initiatives and wish the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt success in hosting and presiding over the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in November in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@My country will soon witness a new blossoming chapter on its democratic path, with the holding of its sixth round of parliamentary and municipal elections in November, so that the Parliament continues to exercise its legislative and oversight powers as an expression of the true will of the electorate within the framework of the coordination between the Shura Council and the Council of Representatives, where the fully elected Council of Representatives provides all Bahrainis with the opportunity to participate and the Shura Council ensures the inclusion of different groups, including minorities, from all walks of life.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain is proud to have in place modern legislation compatible with its accession to seven of the nine major human rights instruments, thereby attaining the highest international human rights standards.@@@The most prominent of our laws recently is the Alternative Sanctions and Measures Law, which has benefited more than 4,200 convicts since its implementation in May 2018, whose approach towards creating open prisons is in line with modern criminal justice systems; the law on restorative justice for children and the protection of children from ill treatment; and other legislation that supports human rights in a society based on freedom, equality, justice, security, tranquillity and social solidarity.@@@In order to enhance its human rights and development gains, my country’s Government has this year approved the national human rights plan for the period 2022 to 2026, which includes 102 projects prepared in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and in consultation with representatives of the legislative, executive and judicial authorities, national human rights institutions and United Nations entities.@@@The plan is currently being implemented through dialogue, interaction, transparency and community partnership as firm principles, in line with His Majesty the King’s reform approach and the Economic Vision 2030 and its principles based on sustainability, fairness and competitiveness.@@@Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, and with the support of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain is continuing its reform and diplomatic approach that supports international partnership to consolidate the values of peace, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, while rejecting extremism, hatred and terrorism, promoting and protecting human rights and supporting sustainable development and service to humankind.@@@We call on the permanent members of the Security Council to de-escalate tensions and work on resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomatic means.@@@We also call on all countries to reaffirm their commitment to the values of tolerance, coexistence, mutual respect and dialogue and to intensify their work together to confront and overcome all challenges for the good and happiness of all humankind and for peoples’ right to build a better future in which safety, peace and tranquillity prevail.@@@I wish you, Mr. President, success in your presidency of the General Assembly at its current session and in strengthening constructive cooperation among Member States in partnership with the United Nations and its main organs and agencies, in order to confront the ongoing challenges and take joint action for the sake of a world that enjoys security and peace and embodies growth and prosperity.@@@I bring warm greetings from the people of the Gambia and the wish that we will have a successful and fruitful seventy-seventh session.@@@It is regrettable that we could not convene a proper general summit over the past two years due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease.@@@Allow me, therefore, to pay a special tribute to the millions of people who have succumbed to the pandemic worldwide.@@@In their memory, we must commit ourselves to better pandemic preparedness and response.@@@My delegation congratulates Mr. Csaba Korosi on his efficient role as President of the General Assembly and I assure him of the Gambia’s support during his tenure.@@@We also felicitate the Secretary-General for ably steering the affairs of the United Nations during what has become one of the most challenging times of the century.@@@Numerous interlocking global challenges requiring coordinated global action make it most pressing for us to rise to the occasion.@@@This makes the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” quite appropriate.@@@In the thick of all the complexities confronting world leaders, we must underscore the centrality of the unique role and potential of the United Nations to make a huge difference in the lives of the people.@@@Durable solutions that match the magnitude and intensity of the never- ending challenges remain the Assembly’s greatest challenge.@@@The situation calls for new perceptions, new approaches, new partnerships, renewed commitments and increased resource levels equal to the scale of both current and emerging challenges.@@@To recover as a global family, we must muster the requisite courage and political will and take advantage of the opportunities that go with the global crises.@@@The current cost-of-living crisis across the world is a wake-up call for an immediate global response to alleviate the suffering and poverty that hold our nations to ransom.@@@The global inflationary trends, food insecurity and the energy crisis compound the natural disasters that continue to cause havoc around the world.@@@The need for relief grows by the day, yet global efforts appear to be less and less effective.@@@In that connection, my delegation fully welcomes the establishment of the Secretary-General’s Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance and eagerly looks forward to concrete, action-oriented recommendations and solutions.@@@As one of the hard-hit developing countries, the Gambia stands ready to cooperate with the Group to find real solutions for immediate relief.@@@We have come to this summit with gratitude for the partnerships and support extended to us from 2016 to date.@@@We thank the Secretary-General personally and the entire United Nations body for their continued support of our peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts.@@@The Gambia has come a long way from dictatorship and has transitioned into a true multiparty democracy.@@@Following the 2021 presidential election and the legislative elections this year, the consolidation process is gaining momentum.@@@We will step up reforming and strengthening our national institutions to sustain a robust democracy where human rights and fundamental freedoms underpin our national policies, programmes and development efforts.@@@As we prepare to end the current electoral cycle with the 2023 local Government elections, we are proud that the Gambia now has multiple political parties and vibrant civil society organizations, with a sharp rise in public participation in national affairs.@@@Amid the socioeconomic challenges that beset our nation, characterized by reduced tourism engagements, inflation, food and energy insecurity, and modest economic growth, we are developing a new National Development Plan 2022-2026, to succeed the current Plan.@@@With this new Plan, we seek to advance the pursuit of our national priorities, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063.@@@We therefore solicit the support of the United Nations system, as well as our friends and development partners.@@@Our goal is to recover and grow our economy, transform digitally and consolidate our democratic gains.@@@Our resolve is to uplift our people
from poverty, secure their livelihoods and create new avenues to transition into a prosperous, peaceful and stable nation.@@@Because young people and women form the greater majority of our population, the Government will continue to empower them.@@@Like all other genuine nations, we are committed to the global consensus that no country should be left behind in this Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Despite its size and economic status, the Gambia is at the forefront of fighting climate change through ambitious national action plans, and we look forward to participating effectively in the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt and the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Qatar.@@@Accelerating development in Africa hinges on addressing the underlying causes of insecurity and underdevelopment.@@@As a continent, our collective goal is to have a peaceful Africa where the people enjoy the dividends of peace, stability and prosperity.@@@African Governments are committed to silencing the guns on the continent as a strategic objective.@@@For that reason, we ask the United Nations and the international community to shoulder their fair share of the burden of the African Union’s peace endeavours.@@@Our experience with keeping the peace in Africa is marked by isolated efforts in many instances.@@@Africa must be provided with adequate equipment and the means to fully play its peace-enforcement role on behalf of the international community.@@@As a long-standing troop- and police-contributing country, the Gambia will continue to support the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative, and we welcome its reinforcement through the Action for Peacekeeping strategy.@@@We are committed to improving the capacity of our officers through increased pre-deployment training, innovative partnerships and more gender-balanced peacekeeping deployment approaches.@@@We must, however, review and do more to address the frequent deadly attacks against peacekeepers in mission areas by giving them realistic mandates.@@@As a sitting member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, the Gambia’s commitment to peace and security in Africa and beyond remains unwavering.@@@We have ongoing conflicts on our continent that need urgent international attention.@@@The complexity of the challenges in the Sahel dictates multipronged approaches and interventions that would ensure sustainable peace and stability.@@@We must therefore reconsider our assumptions concerning that region and seek forward-looking solutions that empower the citizens.@@@The current security and governance situation in Libya equally deserves a fresh thrust from the international community.@@@We call on the contending parties on the ground to give the people a chance to live and coexist in peace.@@@Moroccan sovereignty and territorial rights over its Sahara region should be recognized by all.@@@In that regard, the Government of the Gambia reaffirms its strong support for the Moroccan autonomy initiative, which convincingly serves as a realistic compromise in accordance with United Nations resolutions.@@@Developments in the Horn of Africa also continue to be a source of serious concern.@@@We request the leaders of the region and the international community to explore new options to restore peace in the area.@@@We must equally come together to jointly assist the region to combat terrorism through greater cooperation and intelligence sharing.@@@The humanitarian crisis is enormous and calls for considerable international emergency aid.@@@Reverting to other important matters of global concern, we entreat the Unites States to end the longstanding embargo imposed on Cuba.@@@The reason is that global solidarity and friendly cooperation should define relations among States Members of the United Nations.@@@In the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict needs a new impetus for lasting peace.@@@As a people, the Palestinians deserve a State of their own; we therefore call for a fresh peace initiative that includes the revival of the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@We remain deeply disturbed by the horrors and humanitarian catastrophe arising from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.@@@The destabilizing global economic conditions imposed on the rest of the world are unbearable.@@@In Africa and elsewhere, the cost-of- living crisis and the biting inflation, along with food and energy insecurity, are devastating our economies and continue to frustrate pandemic recovery efforts.@@@Additionally, the debt burden has reached crisis levels.@@@We call for general debt relief.@@@We implore Russia and Ukraine to heed the global plea for political dialogue and end the war.@@@Africa is simply asking for global peace and friendly relations.@@@Our survival and progress depend on global peace and stability.@@@The plight of the Rohingya remains a matter of grave concern to the Gambia.@@@We call on the Myanmar Government to comply with the rulings of the International Court of Justice and end all human rights violations against the Rohingya.@@@The Gambia will continue to defend their rights.@@@As a responsible member of the international community, the Gambia considers Taiwan a part of the People’s Republic of China and advocates the adoption of the One China Policy.@@@We urge the international community, therefore, to fully respect China’s sovereignty over Taiwan and avoid actions that undermine global peace.@@@The Gambia fully supports the Secretary-General’s call for transformation and global solidarity in the landmark report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@In the same vein, we support his efforts to convene the Summit of the Future and the Sustainable Development Goals Summit next year.@@@The renewal of global solidarity and regard for the less fortunate necessitate that we commit ourselves once again to leaving no one behind.@@@Africa will continue to demand its rightful place in the permanent membership category of the Security Council; thus, the negotiations must produce tangible results.@@@Finally, let me emphasize that genuine commitment and substantially increased resources should accompany the transformation of our institutions, systems, mechanisms and state of preparedness, and the developing world must not be left behind.@@@I pray that we have a successful seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I stand before the General Assembly today proudly representing the Republic of Moldova, a future member of the European Union (EU).@@@I am grateful for the unanimous support that we received from the 27 EU member States.@@@I thank them for their recognition and vote of trust in our love for freedom, our dynamic democracy and our commitment to the rule of law.@@@A successful peace project, the European Union — through cooperation and integration — was forged to stop the cycle of wars that tormented our continent for centuries.@@@This is another watershed moment in our history, and the EU has to do it again.@@@By applying to join the European Union, we want the world to know that we are choosing democracy over autocracy, liberty over oppression, peace over war and prosperity over poverty.@@@The EU candidate status gives us hope, a clear sense of direction, a unifying goal, an anchor and a strong sense of belonging to the free world.@@@One year ago, none of us here would have imagined a major war in Europe.@@@Russia’s unprovoked war against another sovereign State, Ukraine, has shaken the world to the core, put to the test the fundamental principles of the United Nations, shattered global security and triggered a European energy crisis, global food shortages and an economic downturn.@@@Seven months of bombings have killed thousands of innocent people and pushed millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes.@@@This war is not just an attack on our neighbour and friend Ukraine.@@@It is an attack on the rules-based international order.@@@It is an attack on nuclear safety.@@@It is an attack on food supplies to countries in the Middle East and Africa.@@@It is an attack on this very institution where we find ourselves in today.@@@We firmly condemn the war against Ukraine, as well as the recently announced additional mobilization of troops by Russia.@@@We firmly stand with Ukraine and support its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.@@@I would like to express my utmost admiration to all Ukrainians for their courage, resilience and inner power to continue this fight for survival, justice and freedom.@@@It is our moral duty, as an international community, to continue supporting Ukraine.@@@Ukraine is fighting today to keep all of us safe, to keep Europe safe.@@@It needs our support.@@@All of us in Europe must help Ukraine.@@@As I stand at this rostrum, I represent a country that wants peace.@@@I represent the citizens of Moldova, who, irrespective of the language that we speak — Romanian, Ukrainian, Russian, Gagauz or Bulgarian — and regardless of our ethnicity or political preferences, whether we live on the right bank of the Dniester River or in the breakaway region of Transnistria, we all want peace.@@@We are a country of fewer than 3 million people, but we have sheltered more than half a million refugees fleeing the war.@@@At the peak of the inflow, our population grew by 4 per cent.@@@Some 80,000 refugees chose to stay among us.@@@I take this opportunity to pay tribute from this high rostrum to all Moldovan families who showed unprecedented solidarity with refugees by opening their homes and hearts to those in need.@@@I am proud of my people.@@@I am also grateful to our international partners, including the United Nations, that have provided assistance in managing the humanitarian crisis.@@@I also thank the Secretary-General and other high-level officials who visited our country in our hour of need in order to show support and solidarity.@@@My deep gratitude goes to France, Germany, Romania and other partners for setting up the Moldova Support Platform, which stands by our country in these difficult times.@@@Moldova knows what it is to be a country divided by conflict.@@@In 1992, we faced a brief but tragic war in the Transnistrian region of our country.@@@Three decades later, we are still trying to overcome the consequences of that conflict and reintegrate our country.@@@The only way to achieve that is through peaceful dialogue and respect for our sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@As Russia has launched its war against Ukraine, we have worked harder than ever to maintain peace on both banks of the Dniester River.@@@We have done our best to ensure that all citizens of Moldova, including those residing in the breakaway region, continue to enjoy peace.@@@The illegal presence of the Russian military troops in the Transnistrian region infringes upon our neutrality and increases the security risks for our country.@@@We call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops.@@@We call for the destruction of ammunition from the Cobasna stockpiles, which pose a security and environmental threat to the region as a whole.@@@As we strive to maintain peace, our economy and society are bearing the brunt of Russia’s war against Ukraine.@@@Our resources are strained, investments have slowed down, trade and transport routes have been disrupted and inflation is nearing 35 per cent.@@@In addition, we are facing a wide spectrum of hybrid threats, from disinformation and propaganda to cyberattacks and energy pressures.@@@The abnormally high prices for natural gas and Russia’s attempts to weaponize gas and oil supplies to Europe have triggered an unprecedented energy crisis.@@@We are one of the most vulnerable countries in the face of this crisis.@@@But that only makes us more determined to diversify our energy sources and decrease dependence on fossil fuels.@@@We plan to increase the share of renewable electricity supplies from 3 to 30 per cent in the next three years.@@@That will make our country stronger and our environment healthier and safer.@@@We all know that the only way to save the planet is through joint global action against climate change.@@@The same goes for the fight against corruption.@@@Corruption weakens States and erodes democracies.@@@We should take it more seriously than we have ever done.@@@We need clear international mechanisms to stop the flow of dirty money.@@@We need better instruments for asset recovery and restitution.@@@We need better information exchanges between law-enforcement and anti-fraud authorities in other countries.@@@And we need to set up international sanctions regimes against corruption.@@@Despite all the challenges, Moldova is pressing ahead with its reform agenda.@@@We are building a stronger and more democratic State.@@@Last year, Moldova moved up 49 positions in the press freedom index, ranking fortieth in the world.@@@Justice reform and the fight against corruption are at the core of our transformation.@@@We are working hard to become a better place for investors to create jobs, boost the economy and bring greater prosperity to our people.@@@We are investing in connectivity with Europe, and we are trying to bring our country closer to European standards.@@@We are building roads and bridges, hospitals and a more modern education system.@@@We are building stronger institutions that will benefit the citizens of Moldova.@@@We are focused, persistent and relentless.@@@We are determined to bring Moldova into the EU so that every Moldovan can have better living standards and more economic opportunities at home.@@@That is the only way for Moldova to grow as a consolidated democracy in our part of the world during these difficult times.@@@As I come before the Assembly from a region weakened by war, an energy crisis, drought and rampant inflation, my message is this.@@@In the face of human- made suffering and economic adversity, the countries of the world must stand together once again.@@@We must do so to reaffirm the value of peace and the inviolability of human life, to defend democracy and freedom and to uphold the right of every country to decide its own fate.@@@At the outset, it is my great pleasure to congratulate you personally, Sir, and the friendly country of Hungary, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@We assure you of our total support in everything that would facilitate the discharge of your tasks.@@@On this occasion, I would also like to express our sincerest gratitude for the efforts of your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, who assumed the tasks of the presidency during the seventy-sixth session.@@@I am also pleased to pay tribute to the great and appreciated efforts exerted by the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, in leading the Organization under the sensitive and delicate circumstances of our world.@@@He has worked to fulfil the lofty vision of the United Nations based on the provisions of its Charter underpinning the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@The historic path of the United Nations over the course of almost eight decades has led us to key facts, namely, that the Organization has addressed changing events, massive challenges and chronic crises in the world.@@@The multiplicity and diversity of the challenges and dangers facing humankind include the spread of deadly diseases, the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, the growing phenomenon of terrorism, in addition to threats related to natural disasters, climate change, poverty and the increase in food insecurity.@@@All those challenges and dangers require international cooperation that would avoid unilateral solutions.@@@In that context, the Organization has played a most prominent role in addressing all emergency and chronic risks that the Secretary-General covered in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@The aim is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals based on more comprehensive foundations, while taking into account the need to address a set of obstacles and to develop innovative scalable solutions and chart a clearer future.@@@In that regard, we reiterate the State of Kuwait’s adherence to the international multilateral system and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in order to realize the lofty vision of the Organization in serving the whole of humankind, as well as fostering mediation and preventive diplomacy to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war and conflicts.@@@The world is following with great interest the developments in the situation in Ukraine and its accelerated complexities, whose effects and repercussions on security and stability have become tangible.@@@In that regard, we affirm our principled and firm position in support of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which reject the use of force, or the threat of the use of force, or even hinting at using it in resolving conflicts among countries.@@@We emphasize the importance of adhering to the principles enshrined in the Charter.@@@In that regard, the State of Kuwait supports all United Nations endeavours and all other international efforts to de-escalate and reach a ceasefire in Ukraine, in order to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.@@@Our experience from contemporary history shows that peace, and its related mechanisms of mediation and dialogue, have always been and will continue to be the optimal choice for resolving conflicts, no matter how long they last.@@@The Palestinian question holds a central and pivotal place in our Arab and Muslim worlds.@@@Tensions and instability will remain prevalent in our region until the proud Palestinian people obtain all their legitimate rights, and until Israel, the occupying Power, ceases its continuous violations of international humanitarian law.@@@We stress the need to undertake efforts to relaunch negotiations within a fixed time frame, in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the terms of reference of the peace process, resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, which would end the Israeli occupation and lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the borders that existed prior to 4 June 1967.@@@The absence of international consensus, on the one hand, and the increase of external interventions, on the other, have been a major reason for the prolongation of the Syrian crisis, which has entered its twelfth year, reflecting one of the ugliest scenes of human suffering ever.@@@In that regard, we reiterate our firm position that there is no military solution to that crisis.@@@We stress the need to work towards a political settlement, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution 2254 (2015), and towards realizing the hopes and aspirations of the brotherly Syrian people.@@@In the context of the crisis in the brotherly Yemen, we once again welcome once the truce agreement between the Yemeni parties and stress the need to implement all of its provisions.@@@We also commend the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen as he works to strengthen compliance with the truce, which was brokered under the auspices of the United Nations and within the context of the peace initiative announced by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in March 2021.@@@Those efforts were undertaken to end the crisis and reach a comprehensive political solution based on the three agreed terms of reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and the resolutions of the Security Council, particularly resolution 2216 (2015).@@@At the regional level, and proceeding from basic premises related to the rules of good-neighbourliness contained in the Charter of the United Nations, we reiterate our call to the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious confidence-building measures so as to start a dialogue based on respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs, as well to reduce tensions in the Gulf region and preserve the safety, security and freedom of maritime navigation, free from any threats.@@@The State of Kuwait is about to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of joining the United Nations, through which we have had many experiences and witnessed global events, most notably the invasion and liberation of my country.@@@It was a success story
for the Organization in its strict implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, at the forefront of which were the relevant outputs of the Security Council and the General Assembly.@@@That has increased our belief in multilateral international action and its importance in achieving the ambitions and aspirations of a world where security, stability and prosperity prevail and where the voice of the people is the main compass for action.@@@The State of Kuwait is celebrating democracy, represented by holding parliamentary elections for the National Assembly.@@@Based on clear and lofty guidance from the political leadership, the Government has secured all the means and capabilities and provided all officials with guidance to meet the needs of the citizens and endeavour to resolve obstacles within the framework of the law.@@@That approach emanates from our belief that any effort towards achieving development will not pay off or have the expected results in the absence of the involvement of citizens or listening to their voices.@@@That is in line with our multilateral vision for development to create a new Kuwait by 2035.@@@In November, our Arab region will witness a prominent world sporting event presented by the Federation Internationale de Football Association World Cup and organized by the sisterly State of Qatar, which reflects its economic and cultural renaissance and confirms its ability to host such major sporting events.@@@We wish the State of Qatar exceptional success as the first Arab and Muslim country to host that international championship.@@@We come together for this annual meeting, bearing the enormous responsibility of exchanging ideas and making commitments to strengthen the intergovernmental public sphere that is vital to respond to the shared needs of our nations.@@@In my final speech as Head of State in this Hall, I wish to highlight the commitment of the Republic of Paraguay, as a member of the international community, to continuing to contribute to the building of a world that accords full respect to fundamental freedoms, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, decent living conditions for all humankind and the uncompromising fight against organized crime, all of which have an international component.@@@The economic and social consequences of the pandemic were still being felt when we began to feel the impact of war at the international level.@@@Our peoples consequently found themselves in the difficult situation of observing the failure of national and international institutions to deal with emergencies.@@@In these circumstances, our first big challenge is to contain demagogic and despotic attempts to manipulate the genuine frustration of citizens.@@@We cannot accept discourse that seeks to sacrifice our sacred freedoms using deceit.@@@More than ever, the world needs temperance, dialogue and moderation.@@@We live in times that demand concrete political commitments, not generic platitudes.@@@That is even more true for the postpandemic years, which promise to be difficult and will require complex reforms that must be shielded from false promises.@@@Latin America, one of the regions most affected by the situation, must be prepared once more to adopt positions of principle that are aligned with the concern for the full validity of human rights and collective self- government.@@@Those positions must be part of broad- based cooperation efforts in which the best-positioned countries have a comprehensive understanding of worldwide imbalances.@@@We must bring stability to the world with a common voice.@@@We cannot ignore what is happening in other territories and leave our fellow nations to their fate.@@@For that reason, Paraguay is a supportive country that acts in alignment with its principles.@@@We have always supported the brotherly Venezuelan people and their struggle for democracy, which is why Paraguay will be taking the lead, together with other countries, on a draft resolution in the Human Rights Council that will allow further in-depth investigation of the violation of human rights in Venezuela.@@@We need to rebuild a moral conscience with respect to the relevance of human rights and democracy.@@@The legal instruments and institutions that we have created to protect them are of undeniable value.@@@However, to protect peoples, it is fundamental that we strengthen the notion of the greater value of human dignity and autonomy, and the inviolability of the person.@@@The current difficult situation requires us to address global problems jointly, without exclusion.@@@Therefore, my country emphatically reiterates its support for the request of the Republic of China on Taiwan to be an integral part of the United Nations system.@@@We are convinced that it would make a valuable contribution to the multilateral system.@@@I take this opportunity to express my solidarity with the Taiwanese people with respect to the recent earthquake, as well as with the peoples of Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico for similar tragedies affecting them.@@@Paraguay joins the vast majority of countries that advocate peace, the rule of international law and the primacy of diplomacy.@@@We are concerned about the situation in Ukraine and the humanitarian and economic consequences of the conflict.@@@We strongly call for the cessation of hostilities and the resumption of negotiations.@@@It is essential that our Organization, and the international community in general, participate intensively in this process.@@@In that regard, we note the scrutiny of the role of the Security Council in this sensitive international context.@@@It is imperative to rethink how the Council operates so as to guide it towards effective performance, and to strengthen the role of the General Assembly as a space for channelling the views of all States.@@@Another issue that brings us together in terms of cooperation is the health of the international financial system.@@@We cannot continue talking about global initiatives to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development when our economies are contaminated by the distribution of profits from illicit activities.@@@Recently, Paraguay received satisfactory news from the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America, having passed its evaluation as a result of a joint effort to modernize our institutional structure to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.@@@We are a country committed to cooperation and we understand the importance of adopting preventive and punitive measures.@@@That is a task that no State should shirk or be complacent about.@@@The rule of law is a global objective that goes beyond political beliefs, and anyone who sees it otherwise conspires against community life.@@@Under my administration, Paraguay aligned in a heretofore unseen way the efforts of security institutions and put them to work in the largest operation in history against organized crime.@@@That success was due not only to the work of our public forces, but also to the coordinated work that was carried out with friendly foreign agencies, with whom we verified once again the importance of joining forces if we want to achieve results against criminal groups.@@@Similarly, in collaboration with intelligence agencies, we determine and provide information about the route of an airplane and its crew when a link to international terrorism is indicated.@@@Another area of cooperation is the field of sustainable development.@@@Paraguay, as part of the global food-production machine, has been making progress in transforming its production matrix and implementing sustainable practices in agricultural and livestock production, as well as exploiting its 100-per cent clean and renewable energy.@@@If all our efforts are to really make sense, we need the countries that, due to their nature, bear the greatest responsibility to act accordingly.@@@We inhabit the same planet and are obligated to take care of nature and future generations.@@@That is the responsibility of each State in fair measure.@@@That is why Paraguay, along with other countries, promoted the creation of a Special Rapporteur on climate change in the Human Rights Council, which will help make the true impact of this crisis visible worldwide.@@@Paraguay’s commitment continues to grow every day.@@@In addition to being among the five countries of the region that managed to increase foreign direct investment during the pandemic, we were able to double private investment in the last four years.@@@A few months ago, we saw an improvement in our credit outlook, according to Moody’s — a fact that corresponds to the historical, sensible and stable management of our economy.@@@We are part of the most important logistics and economic corridor in South America.@@@At the same time, we continue to roll out an unprecedented infrastructure plan that will allow for greater connectivity and access to markets.@@@As can be seen, despite the challenges we have experienced, we enjoy conditions that make us look to the future with hope.@@@Finally, I would like to talk about the vision underpinning the Republic of Paraguay’s approach to the world.@@@Beyond our legitimate differences, we must find common paths.@@@We have common challenges that we cannot face independently.@@@My country is committed to the Organization and hopes that its purposes will be achieved.@@@As Pope Francis says, we are all in the same boat and called on to make the commitment to dismantling the walls that separate us.@@@May God bless all our nations.@@@It is a great honour and privilege to address the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session here in New York today.@@@At this particularly challenging time in human history, I welcome the important theme of this session, which directs us all to jointly find transformative solutions to the various interlocking challenges that
we face today.@@@There is absolutely no doubt that we, as a community of nations, now collectively face the most challenging socioeconomic and environmental situation we have experienced in modern history.@@@In fact, I can say with sadness that the situation is dire and potentially existential.@@@Therefore, without transformative and urgent implementable solutions to those interlocking challenges of our time, the small window of opportunity we have to act together will pass, to the detriment of all our citizens and to the world.@@@Our actions today will surely determine our fate and that of the generations to come.@@@The burden on all of our shoulders is heavy and failure is not an option.@@@Most of the world is still recovering from the devastating health and socioeconomic impact of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@The pandemic was unprecedented in its impact on the daily lives of all citizens across the world.@@@It has changed the ways in which we live forever and clearly presented how unprepared the world is for such shocks and disruptions.@@@In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has painfully illustrated how far apart the world is in terms of development and its ability to respond to such a huge crisis through the top-down distribution of the vaccines.@@@Richer nations were able to invest in the distribution of life-saving vaccines more rapidly for their citizens, while developing countries like Somalia waited for whatever was available and whatever they could afford or were gifted by international partners.@@@While vaccine inequality is symbolic of the existing development divide between the developed and the developing world, we, as a community of nations, understood that we can and must stand together to overcome even the greatest challenges if we have a strong global system of cooperation, collaboration and action.@@@In that regard, the Somali Federal Government is grateful to all the dedicated medical professionals on the front lines against COVID-19, as well as those bilateral and multilateral partners that have supported our national efforts to vaccinate our people and provide protection for their livelihoods through the difficult COVID-19 crisis.@@@Today we must ensure that the global inequality of the COVID-19 vaccine is not replicated with the looming food security crisis.@@@Our world is becoming less secure through recurring conflict, increasing international terrorism and the destructive impact of the climate change.@@@I cannot prioritize between those three interlocking challenges, because they are equally dangerous and directly harmful to any progress we make, anywhere in the world, on achieving the vital Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@In fact, those complex and interconnected crises are the drivers of today’s unprecedented international humanitarian crises, food insecurity, rapid urbanization and the burdensome international cost of the livelihood crisis, which is pushing most of the world’s population into poverty.@@@Indeed, we are at an unbearable juncture in human history, where citizens are looking to their respective Governments and the international multilateral system to provide meaningful policy responses that are anchored in transformative and sustainable solutions.@@@Accordingly, we, as a community of nations, must be more optimistic and work even more closely together instead of retreating into nationalistic isolation, which cannot and will not serve our global citizenry in this new age of interconnectivity and interdependence.@@@In Somalia, we are working tirelessly to transition from over two decades of devastating conflict, drought, famine and development stagnation to a new age of stability, progress and prosperity.@@@However, despite our continuing efforts, Somalia and its resilient people are facing some of the most complex and interconnected crises in the world.@@@Those crises include ongoing regional drought, which is directly threatening the lives and livelihoods of Somalia’s most vulnerable communities.@@@In fact, our Government has called on all its business community, diaspora and international partners on to work with us to do everything possible to avert the possible looming famine.@@@We urge all our partners to heed our call and work with us to provide immediate support and relief to the most affected communities.@@@In the long term, we must collectively work together to ensure that we mitigate the acceleration of the dangerous and costly climate crisis by meeting the commitment to investing in and adequately financing climate adaptation in the most affected and vulnerable regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa.@@@Key areas of investment must be sustainable water management, biodiversity protection to enhance food security, climate-smart agriculture, resilient infrastructure and greater investment in renewable energy.@@@In Somalia, for the first time, we have established a new Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to lead the urgent process of addressing the devastating impact of our national and regional environmental deterioration.@@@Somalia is caught between floods and droughts annually, owing to climate change and poor infrastructure.@@@Our people, who have a long tradition of living harmoniously with nature and who barely contribute to the poisonous emissions warming the Earth, are the ones paying with their lives today.@@@We are therefore taking the matter of protecting our environment seriously because we know that climate change is real.@@@We are living with the evidence of its painful and destructive reality today.@@@We also know that Somalia and the rest of the world cannot develop sustainably without jointly addressing the global climate crisis quickly and effectively, because our whole way of life and the most important job- creating productive sectors of our economy, including agriculture, livestock, fisheries and the wider blue economy, depend on the climate.@@@Terrorists are making our word less safe by the day.@@@Terrorism remains a persistent and complex challenge that both contributes to and exacerbates all other crises, including food insecurity, the displacement of people from their homes and climate change.@@@Terrorists have no religion or human values.@@@They are violent criminals who simply seek to terrorize innocent people.@@@We must continue to stand up to them with all our collective strength and effort.@@@Nowhere in the world has there been an example of a terrorist organization succeeding against a united Government and people, let alone governing justly, as may be falsely claimed.@@@The most important lesson we have learned in the long modern war against international terrorists and terrorism is that neither can be contained or degraded.@@@They need to be comprehensively defeated, wherever they exist.@@@In Somalia, we are actively fighting the terrorist group called Al-Shabaab, which is an affiliate of Al-Qaida, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, separately.@@@Both criminally misrepresent the beautiful and peaceful Islamic religion and values to destabilize the region and, in the process, terrorize the Somali people and their brothers and sisters in neighbouring countries and across the world.@@@In recent weeks, the unprovoked, violent and senseless actions of Al-Shabaab against innocent civilians across Somalia have highlighted the urgent need for an expedited common national and international response to defeating the group, on a permanent basis, to advance regional and global security.@@@At the height of the humanitarian crisis, the group, which falsely claims to be Islamic, blew up desperately needed water wells and water catchment areas, banned transportation carrying food and killed innocent people, who were already struggling to live because of the impact of the severe drought in our country today.@@@That is the true criminal and despicable face and intentions of terrorists and terrorism.@@@On its part, the Somali Federal Government and its federal member states, with the direct support of our brave and resilient people, are responding by challenging and defeating the remaining terrorist groups in major localities.@@@The Somali people have begun to organically rise up in support of their Government’s call to free themselves and their nation from the evils of terrorism.@@@As recently as this past month, more towns and villages were recovered as a result of our offensive military operations, with the support of local communities.@@@We are now confident that with enhanced public support, our Government will eliminate terrorism from Somalia because the Somali people have finally realized that Al-Shabaab’s repressive actions will not end until we all take action to achieve that.@@@In a nutshell, the Somali people now believe that Al-Shabaab can and will be defeated, and that is our real source of energy and inspiration, as a Government in the fight against international terrorism.@@@At the policy level, the Somali Government will continue to work with all its partners, including the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, in the fight against global terrorism.@@@We are fully committed to doing the heavy lifting to secure our future.@@@However, to deliver the killer blow to the violence and insecurity, we must think past the notion of containing and degrading Al-Shabaab or any other terrorist organization, anywhere in the world.@@@We know that those policies are no longer as effective as they were once thought to be at this advanced stage in the fight against the ever-evolving global terrorism threat.@@@Instead, we need to focus all our joint efforts on the Somali Government’s new strategy of militarily, ideologically and financially challenging terrorism and terrorists to ensure that they are comprehensively defeated, once and for all and quickly.@@@Furthermore, the Somali Government is sincerely committed to working with all its partners to effectively train, equip and sustain its armed forces, with a view to moving forward
fully.@@@That is the only long-term sustainable solution for stability and progress in our country, the region and the world at large.@@@The Somali Government is working within a complex network of challenges that include the effects of climate change and poverty.@@@Without predictable and committed national and international financing, it will not be possible to find transformative solutions to the interlocking challenges we face today.@@@In Somalia, we are working to enhance our economic capacity through a rigorous economic and financial reform programme that will strengthen Somalia’s economy, improve public financial management and mobilize more urgently needed domestic resources to ensure a more sustainable and swift response to the crisis.@@@We are very grateful to international financial organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which support Somalia in implementing real economic and financial reform.@@@However, given Somalia’s fragile economic situation as a recovering post-conflict State, the financing of global development priorities must be underpinned by a common international commitment to supporting countries like ours with more concessionary financing, capacity-building and investment in all areas that can strengthen resilience to today’s multiple crises, including climate change, insecurity and the provision of social protection for the most vulnerable in our societies.@@@We must also facilitate and promote private sector investment and participation in overcoming those challenges to transition from what is now simply referred to as a corporate social responsibility to common social prosperity, in which we all contribute our fair share.@@@Our Government must facilitate and improve further the enabling environment necessary for that private investment.@@@In conclusion, there is no escaping the vicious cycle of complex and interconnected global crises, which challenges our citizens and the wider world.@@@What is even more worrisome is that they have become repetitive, and without strong bilateral, multilateral civil society and private sector partnerships, they cannot be addressed effectively anywhere or by any single nation or geographic region alone.@@@In the absence of urgent and effective joint action starting today, the dream of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will remain just that — a mere distant dream.@@@For its part, the Somali Government is committed and determined to defeat international terrorism alongside all its international partners, address extreme poverty, raise the environmental consciousness of our population, mitigate the worst of the climate change impact and rebuild an inclusive, resilient and people-centred society and economy through our successful ongoing socioeconomic reform programme.@@@That is the basis for the transformative solutions that will help us mitigate and overcome the interlocking challenges that our nations face today and pave the way for future progress and prosperity.@@@The most important lesson we have learned from dealing with the multiple, complex and interconnected crises in Somalia is that we must not always be behind, but must plan for and respond to the worst emergencies.@@@When we have many early national and international warning systems in place, it is better and more prudent to plan ahead and focus on building resiliency by finding and financing durable solutions that help to deliver sustainable development for the most vulnerable across the world.@@@In Somalia, we have a wise saying that one finger cannot wash your whole face.@@@If we work together sincerely and collaboratively as a community of nations, no challenge, no matter how big it is, is insurmountable.@@@First of all, I thank God and the Virgin Mary for making it possible for us to gather here, and I ask them to enlighten the work of this session.@@@I would like to convey to the General Assembly the greetings of His Excellency Mr. Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, President of the Republic of Panama, who has delegated me to represent our country here today.@@@Our country firmly supports the important themes proposed for consideration at this session of the General Assembly.@@@We share the view that, in order to overcome the global health crisis and move forward in the transition to a post-pandemic world, we must promote creative solutions and share a greater degree of solidarity and support, using science as a fundamental ally to confront the challenges facing humankind.@@@Knowledge, research and education are the tools required to ensure that transition, especially in nations with high levels of poverty, where millions continue to be deprived of the opportunity to live a dignified life.@@@Too many people continue to starve; meanwhile, others suffer from indigestion.@@@Withholding knowledge instead of sharing it is a selfish act.@@@The current Government of the Republic of Panama has been at the helm of the country for 38 months, 30 of them during the pandemic.@@@No other Administration in the history of Panama has been confronted with such complex challenges.@@@In that regard, we concentrated our efforts on saving lives, preventing the collapse of the health system and maintaining social peace.@@@Two and a half years later, we are on the threshold of recovering from the damage caused by the global health crisis, and we continue to make progress.@@@We are capable of achieving exceptional outcomes that we can share with the world.@@@Our national strategic plan was conceived with a particular objective in mind: fighting the causes of poverty and inequality.@@@Our Government’s leadership rests on our commitment to laying the foundations for profound transformations.@@@While our country is indeed experiencing robust growth, it also faces unacceptable inequality, and we are working tenaciously and tirelessly to combat that reality.@@@Our Administration seeks to lay the foundations for a fairer country, consolidate democracy and strengthen the independence of the judiciary.@@@For the first time in the history of our country, as Head of the Government, the President waived his prerogative to unilaterally appoint the judges of the Supreme Court of Justice and established a system of independent evaluation based on professional merit.@@@Also for the first time in the history of our country, the majority of the judges on the Supreme Court of Justice are women, and none of them has any relationship, link or subordination to the President of the Republic.@@@In Panama as in the rest of the world, we had to face the pandemic.@@@Protecting human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable, was our primary mission.@@@We deployed creativity and innovation to develop technological instruments that enabled us to serve our population directly, openly and equitably.@@@We transformed Panama’s national identity card into an instrument for transferring resources — a free debit card, in fact.@@@We were the first country on the continent to implement a centralized tracing and monitoring system for communicable diseases, which registers every case
of infection in real time in our national epidemiological surveillance system.@@@We stopped students’ learning processes from being disrupted during the lockdown period by using the strategy for resilient educational transformation computer platform, known as ESTER.@@@We guarantee free internet access to the vast majority of students, including those in remote communities.@@@We are currently overseeing the development of the MedicApp platform, an innovative digital database that keeps citizens informed in real time about the availability of medicines, as well as points of sale and comparative prices.@@@We are willing to share those experiences and achievements — which have been recognized by international organizations, including the United Nations — with the international community.@@@I fully share with our President Cortizo the belief that dialogue, participation and consensus build social peace.@@@To cite a concrete example, at the height of the pandemic, we promoted a bicentennial pact initiative on the theme of closing gaps, designed as a point of contact for Panamanian society, as a way to develop a framework for how it sees itself in the future — and we see a country with a common good for all that is prosperous, safe and lives in peace.@@@A total of 186,182 proposals were freely presented as possible solutions to problems encountered in the population.@@@From that broad consultation, there have emerged national agreements that respond to the real concerns of the Panamanian people and transcend governmental term periods.@@@The destabilization of fuel prices also led to demonstrations and protests in Panama, primarily owing to the increase in the costs of food, medicine and gasoline.@@@Instead of confrontation, President Cortizo opted for dialogue.@@@Nobody in our country lost their life during those protests.@@@Our governing style has enabled agreement and consensus where the deepest needs of the population are concerned.@@@Our national Government has articulated concrete provisions and measures.@@@And it is very important to point out that we have been able to ensure social peace.@@@In the global context, dialogue is the only way to reduce the space for extremism.@@@Accessible medicine is the difference between life and death.@@@President Cortizo has decided to confront that issue with courage and political will.@@@To that end, he instructed me to establish and organize our country’s national Commission of Medicines with a view to securing a supply of medicines for our population, with prices much lower than the current ones.@@@The pharmaceutical industry, including the production, supply and distribution of medicines in the world, is supposed to contribute to people’s health; however, we note with concern that millions of people cannot access medicines.@@@That access has become a cold, businesslike exchange.@@@The oligopolies earn disproportionately high profits from the medicines they distribute and sell to both Governments and private individuals.@@@Such a system, which is shameful for humankind, cannot continue.@@@It is everyone’s responsibility — and we must examine and address the global implications — to ensure that access to medicines is valued as a human right and not as an expensive luxury commodity.@@@Panama calls on the General Assembly to adopt a global initiative to solve the issue of the excessively high prices of medicines and their inaccessibility to the people of the world.@@@Panama is in fact a transit country for irregular migration.@@@Thousands of people transit through the Darien Gap jungle crossing on the border with Colombia.@@@It is a dangerous and treacherous crossing, where people risk their lives, get sick and die.@@@We are not just a transit country for migration.@@@Also included in that context are criminal organizations engaged in the nefarious business of human trafficking.@@@Our Government has adopted a State policy for addressing and providing assistance to migrants, with a particular emphasis on humanity and solidarity.@@@We emphasize that the possible solutions to this painful and regrettable situation can be provided by the origin countries, whose poverty and social marginalization determine irregular migration, as well as those of us are affected by the transits, especially the countries of destination.@@@Our Government believes that the current development model must be transformed to take into account the value of biodiversity and to promote healthy and sustainable ecosystems.@@@Panama is one of the three carbon-negative countries in the world.@@@Some 35 per cent of our national territory and 30.5 per cent of our seas have been declared as natural protected areas.@@@More than 80 per cent of our electricity generation comes from renewable sources.@@@In July of this year alone, we achieved a new historic record: 95 per cent of the energy generated to supply our national matrix was clean energy.@@@Our country ranks eighth in the world for clean-energy generation.@@@President Cortizo’s energy transition agenda has strengthened Panama’s global leadership in combating
climate change.@@@Panamanians have a historical awareness of the value of our geographic position because of the presence of the Panama Canal and the role it plays in the world economy.@@@We are a country with a mission to protect its natural resources.@@@Young people are harshly critical of the many forums, summits and declarations on climate change and the preservation of the environment and natural resources that continue to be held while emissions and deforestation increase without restraint, along with the contamination of water, aquifers, rivers and oceans.@@@How can we win the trust of new generations while the planet where we live, and our descendants will have to live, is being destroyed before their eyes?@@@How many more lives must be lost?@@@How many more natural disasters must take place?@@@I wonder: when are they going to stop the ecocide?@@@From this rostrum, we remind the big emitters of gases, those that encourage deforestation and those that dump chemicals that pollute and kill, that it is matter of the survival of the Earth and the species that inhabit it.@@@Today, before this gathering of nations, Panama proposes that the time has come for the world to have an international body to hold all those that inflict damage on the planet accountable.@@@The future depends on every decision that we take now.@@@It is no longer viable to take the wrong direction and then try to correct it.@@@The path of conflict and war leads to more calamities and disasters.@@@It is the wrong path.@@@Because of its geography and ethnic and cultural diversity, Panama is a country of openness and common ground.@@@Situated at one of the main maritime corridors in the world, at the centre of the American continent, we Panamanians are always ready to serve humankind, as we have done for centuries.@@@Today, before the General Assembly, we want to resolutely say to the world that it depends, and will always depend, on Panama.@@@The times we live in have changed.@@@The world that was is no more.@@@Ahead of us, we have the challenge of building another world — a better world, with answers to ensure human health and life on this planet, which is our home, a world with greater solidarity and peace.@@@We must succeed.@@@United, we will always be much stronger.@@@I wish to begin by conveying to this august body fraternal greetings from Her Excellency Ms. Sarnia Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who could not attend this year’s session owing to pressing national commitments.@@@It is therefore my distinct honour and privilege to address the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on behalf of the Government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania.@@@Let me join those who have spoken before me in congratulating the President of the Assembly on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I assure him of Tanzania’s support and cooperation as he discharges his responsibilities.@@@Let me also extend our appreciation to the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres and the entire United Nations Secretariat for their dedicated service as guardians of the common interest of all peoples and all States, particularly during this time of unprecedented global challenges.@@@This Assembly is convening at a critical point, when the world is engulfed in dangerous flames ranging from conflicts and mounting geopolitical tensions, devastating effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, food and energy insecurity, environmental carnage and extreme climate-change-related events, to barriers to education, technology and opportunity for shared prosperity.@@@These challenges are in turn inextricably linked with and propelling stubborn global poverty.@@@Furthermore, with only eight years remaining before 2030, the world is still way off the mark in meeting many of the targets that we set in 2015.@@@The root cause of all these challenges is human greed, selfish desire and unilateralism.@@@Yet we know for sure that unilateralism, driven by greed, is leading us, rich and poor, strong and weak, to a catastrophe.@@@For it is now evident that these challenges have inflicted and continue to inflict enormous disruptive impacts on economies, ecosystems and social lives worldwide, with sub-Saharan African countries and other developing countries being hit disproportionately.@@@We have a famous proverb in Kiswahili that says, “Where there are problems, ingenuity increases.”@@@In the spirit of this, we in Tanzania are convinced that transformative solutions to the global challenges we face are already at our disposal but subject to two conditions being met: first, there must be a passionate belief in the need to bring a caring spirit to considering the needs and happiness of other peoples and nations; and, secondly, there must be solemn adherence to the credo of multilateralism and collaborative efforts.@@@Fortunately, both conditions are a restatement of the ideals, values and principles of the United Nations Charter.@@@Specifically, on the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic had devastating effects on Tanzania’s socioeconomic systems and performance.@@@As it did for most other developing countries, the pandemic robbed us of precious lives, over-stretched health infrastructure and health-care workers to the limit and led to severe budget constraints and economic deceleration.@@@Real gross domestic product growth declined from 6.7 per cent decadal growth attained in the pre-pandemic period to 4.8 per cent in 2020.@@@The key lesson we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that the world needs to be better prepared in terms of national and global health systems in order to be able to handle future pandemics.@@@This entails investing more in building health infrastructure and beefing up the health workforce, as well as enhancing national and regional capacity to manufacture drugs, supplies, vaccines and medical equipment.@@@In addition, Africa’s marginalization in the provision of vaccines underscored the need for African countries to work together in the development and nurturing of indigenous solutions through joint medical and scientific research.@@@The pandemic also brought to the fore the need to invest more in public health education, especially preventive medicine to build individual resilience, including body fitness and healthy diet and habits.@@@However, I wish to acknowledge that although international support in taming the spread of the global pandemic, through provision of diagnostic equipment, medicines, vaccine support programmes and financing came late to Africa, it was critical in winning the war against the pandemic.@@@Tanzania would therefore like to thank all our development partners that have been working with us to deal with the pandemic and put the country on a bright post- COVID-19 recovery path.@@@Currently, the Government continues with its vaccination campaign whereby, as of 11 September, we already vaccinated 60.56 per cent of the targeted population.@@@With respect to climate change, we are indeed at a tipping point.@@@The United Republic of Tanzania appreciates all individual efforts and other collective measures taken thus far to implement interventions geared at upscaling mitigation and adaptation as stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015.@@@However, despite the efforts, we are observing unprecedented changes across the whole climate system in every region.@@@The fact remains that the most vulnerable countries, including Tanzania, have been disproportionately affected and that we do not possess the capacity to effectively respond.@@@Tanzania has put forward ambitious targets on both adaptation and mitigation through nationally determined contributions (NDCs).@@@The Government spends an average of $500 million per annum on adaptation measures and up to 3 per cent of its gross domestic product on mitigation and building community resilience.@@@With the help of the international community, we are committed to continually updating our NDCs and making important progress to tackle climate change.@@@Yet, unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions,
limiting warming to at least 2°C will be elusive.@@@As much as we remain committed, most developing countries have insufficient fiscal space and weak debt- sustainability status to address increasing demand for climate-resilience interventions.@@@Addressing the climate crisis therefore requires reliable access to climate finance.@@@It is on this note, that Tanzania calls on the international community to live up to its commitments made under the Paris Agreement.@@@Enhanced capacity building, technology transfer and support for adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as the creation of an independent loss-and-damage financial facility must be implemented in order to scale up the fight against climate change.@@@We need, as a matter of urgency, to take action and walk the talk.@@@At this point, I must emphasize that Tanzania and the rest of Africa need a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.@@@Africa must be given time to adjust since the majority of Africans have no access to energy.@@@The well-established principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities must be observed.@@@In this regard, we call upon the lifting of opposition to global financing and implementation of the transformative projects in our countries that aim to harness our hydrocarbon deposits for energy and other equally important uses to address our critical developmental needs.@@@As long as robust environmental and social impact assessments have been done and concrete measures taken to effectively address the environmental and democratic governance concerns of our citizens, our sovereign rights to pursue transformative projects should be respected.@@@We also call upon transparency in the conduct of carbon-credit markets so that Africa benefits fairly from our earnest effort to take care of the carbon sinks that we are holding for the world.@@@For example, Tanzania has preserved over 30 per cent of our total land area — a land mass almost equivalent to the size of Germany — which includes forests and wildlife parks.@@@In the maintenance of peace and security, Tanzania has always believed that diplomacy is the best instrument for resolving conflicts.@@@Experience has taught us that, in war, everyone loses, including the non-warring parties.@@@It is therefore our plea that, in the wake of global conflicts, our focus should remain to be on safeguarding human lives, especially children and women, and the well-being of people.@@@Moreover, just recently, we have witnessed disruptive effects on global supply chains, dramatic increases in food and fuel prices as well as food shortages and declines in agricultural and industrial production around the world — all the more reasons to state that we all have a stake in pursuing the peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@As we do so, we must also leverage our abundant resources and human capabilities to address some of the impacts.@@@In the same spirit, peacekeeping operations remain one of the most dependable instruments for promoting world peace and security.@@@Tanzania is proud to have contributed men and women in 5 of the existing 16 peacekeeping missions across the world.@@@Despite this state of affairs, Tanzania stands ready to contribute more, if requested to do so.@@@We also continue to actively participate in regional peace initiatives — and more so now in our capacity as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council as well as the East African Community and Southern African Development Community.@@@We therefore call upon the United Nations to enhance its support to regional efforts in peacebuilding and peacekeeping.@@@The credibility of the United Nations rests on a well-represented and responsive Security Council.@@@We therefore wish to reiterate the common African position, as elaborated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, with respect to the long-awaited reforms of the Security Council.@@@It is well past time the Security Council reflected the present-day realities of the United Nations membership and not that of the 1940s.@@@I would be remiss if I did not end my statement without acknowledging that, the world celebrated the Kiswahili Language for the first time this year on 7 July, following the historic UNESCO declaration designating that date as World Kiswahili Language Day.@@@As the birthplace of the Kiswahili language, Tanzania commends the efforts of the United Nations in promoting multilingualism as a core value, which is essential to achieving both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.@@@To conclude, let me once again reaffirm the resolve of the United Republic of Tanzania to uphold the three pillars of the United Nations, namely, peace and security, development and human rights.@@@I also call upon all of us to renew our commitment and prioritization of actions especially on those Sustainable Development Goals where we lag behind.@@@We remain committed to working closely with the United Nations and its Member States in the spirit of multilateralism and global solidarity towards a sustainable future.@@@Let me join in the congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election to lead this organ and assure him of Saint Lucia’s support as he presides over our deliberations at one of the most critical moments in the history of this Organisation.@@@I address the General Assembly with the democratic permission of the people of Saint Lucia, a small but proud State in the Eastern Caribbean.@@@We insist that our history and present circumstances place upon us the responsibility of serving as voices of redemption and hope at times of crisis.@@@I agree with the theme under which this seventy- seventh session is being conducted — “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” — because, given the morbid developments in the contemporary global political environment, it is reasonable to conclude that we have deviated, to our detriment, from the course that the framers of the Charter of the United Nations set for us.@@@It is for that reason that we have arrived at a watershed moment in history.@@@We have arrived at this watershed moment in history because, we, the Members of the United Nations, have not adhered to the rules and principles of the Organization that we created seventy-six years ago as a multilateral answer to the human propensity to use arms against our fellow humans, instead of joining with them to turn those weapons into tools for peace and development.@@@We have arrived at this watershed moment because we have failed to adhere to the agreements we have negotiated multilaterally to solve the problems that have confronted us — problems invariably of our own making.@@@We have come to this watershed moment because small developing countries continue to suffer from an inequitable world order in which the rich and powerful do not right the wrongs they commit against the weak.@@@Despite our small size; despite our deliberate desire to be a source of peace and friendship to all; despite our democratic traditions; and despite our earnest efforts to make the development of our people our primary objective, we find ourselves in a world stacked against us and frustrating our development at every turn.@@@Sadly, a survey of the global political economy of the past four decades reads like a cascading series of crises and a frustrating tale of arrested development and dashed hopes for the people of the Caribbean.@@@In every decade since 1980, we have faced the ill winds of a harsh and global environment, to which we have been forced to change course without reward and with little to show for our efforts.@@@In the 1990s, it was the entry of the United Kingdom into the European single market that removed any lingering protections from which we had benefited and that placed us at greater exposure to a world of liberalized trade, with no consideration for our specific historical circumstances.@@@Then came the decade of the 2000s, in which the World Trade Organization was formalized and with which came an even harsher reality of trade liberalization that has not lived up to its promise of cheaper goods and services for all.@@@Instead, we have mostly witnessed declines in the demand for our primary commodities, such as bananas, sugar and rum.@@@If anything, the new rules of trade have taught us harsh lessons on how global arrangements are designed to punish us when we are accused of wrong, but fail to reward and protect us when we are wronged.@@@The experience of Antigua and Barbuda is instructive in this regard.@@@In the year 2001, we witnessed the terrorist attack on the United States of America, which brought with it another round of negative economic circumstances.@@@9/11 was followed by the global financial crisis of 2008 — a crisis not of our own making, but one for which we in the Caribbean were amongst the hardest hit.@@@Our tourism industries suffered tremendously as the financial losses in the main source markets resulted in a reduction of tourism traffic to our countries.@@@This tale of frustrated development continued in 2016 with Brexit and was worsened by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Presently, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has brought with it unseen hikes and uncertainty in the price of oil and has wiped out all of our hopes for a smooth recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@In addition, 20 years after the first International Conference on Financing for Development in 2002, the mechanisms and global frameworks we established through the United Nations financing for development process tell a damning story of gaps and short falls, commitments not kept, systematic barriers reinforced and negative challenges.@@@Had all our partners lived up to their commitments, our current circumstances of economic distress may not have been as dire.@@@Our diversification into financial services is also threatened by an uneven regime of negative regulations.@@@And, overarching all of this are the continued challenges of climate change, with its fierce occurrences of floods, droughts and hurricanes, adding yet more uncertainty to our economic projections and aspirations.@@@It is no longer breaking news or a matter of debate that climate change is one of the biggest crises facing humankind today, but the solutions to the universal climate change emergency are not mystifying.@@@From the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in which we agreed that limiting global warming to below 1.5° C would help us stay alive, to the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow, we have followed the science, negotiated, compromised and agreed upon the solutions.@@@The problem is that these agreements have been broken or simply ignored.@@@Those who are the biggest perpetrators of the climate crisis and who were supposed to take the corresponding greatest action have not followed through on their commitments.@@@The quantum of financing for climate justice, needed by developing countries and agreed upon by the developed countries, has not materialized.@@@Other issues of the Paris rule book are still to be implemented.@@@The multilateral development financial institutions have yet to change their systems to make it easier for developing countries to access the financing required to adapt to climate change and build climate resilient economies.@@@Developing countries, already saddled with debt, must be given the means to be able to deal with climate change.@@@We must act together to save our people and our planet.@@@It is regrettable, therefore, that recent political differences between two of the biggest polluting countries have led to a halting of cooperation between them on climate issues.@@@The future of our planet must never be held hostage to the politics of super- Power rivalry.@@@I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and the people of Grenada on the appointment of their former Environment Minister Simon Stiel as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@The appointment of someone from a small island State is, we hope, a signal that the world is listening to the pleas of the most vulnerable for positive and urgent action in this climate crisis.@@@We urge the developed world to act upon the solutions to climate change that they have agreed upon.@@@For decades, we have called on global financial institutions to carve out a special regime that takes into account our smallness and vulnerabilities to climate change.@@@This is not an unreasonable demand.@@@We have insisted that many of the challenges that we face have come from the external environment and are not of our own making.@@@Given our small size and miniscule levels of industrial pollution, we are among the least responsible for global warming, but given our small size and vulnerable economies, we are among the most defenceless to the ravages of climate change.@@@A single hurricane that destroys our entire agricultural crop or destroys our tourism plant and infrastructure can set us back by decades.@@@We are simply asking that these vulnerabilities be considered when our financial obligations for development assistance are being negotiated.@@@That will result in the mutually beneficial solution of ensuring that the wheels of the global economy keep on turning, while at the same time allowing us the breathing space to participate meaningfully, with a renewed sense of faith, in the legitimacy of the global financial system and its institutions.@@@For three decades, from the adoption of Agenda 21 through several General Assembly resolutions and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the SAMOA@@@Pathway, there have been calls for the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index for SIDS.@@@The index would replace the unreliable and unfair gross national income index that precludes SIDS from accessing badly needed low cost and concessional financing for their development.@@@The work on the multidimensional vulnerability index by the United Nations and other institutions, such as the Caribbean Development Bank, must now be accelerated and finalized.@@@A reform of the regime can no longer be ideological or political.@@@We need to include the vulnerabilities of small States like Saint Lucia when calculating the value of their economies.@@@This is a matter of survival for our people.@@@We are disappointed that in another area of vital importance to small island developing States — ocean governance — we have failed to adopt the first-ever multilateral maritime biodiversity treaty, stalled in August, because the developed countries of the North were once again unwilling to accommodate the needs of the developing world of the South.@@@Protecting the oceans is an imperative, and agreement on the sharing and sustainable use of the marine resources that are beyond national jurisdiction is essential.@@@Bearing in mind that these areas do not belong to one country but are the heritage of all humankind, Saint Lucia therefore calls for the urgent resumption of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, so that the treaty’s text can be finalized, taking into account the special circumstances of small island developing States.@@@Articles 2 and 33 of the United Nations Charter are unambiguous in binding Member States to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State and to negotiate
and settle all international disputes by peaceful means.@@@In the Declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, Heads of State and Government reaffirmed those principles when they said: “We will promote peace and prevent conflicts ...@@@We will abide by international law and ensure justice” (resolution 75/1, paras. 9 and 10).@@@The war in Ukraine has not only unleashed death and horrendous destruction, but has plunged the world into an economic crisis of runaway inflation and shortages of food and energy supplies and worsened a global supply chain crisis that had been triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The world could have been spared this humanitarian and economic agony if once again countries and their leaders had respected and adhered to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We therefore call upon all parties involved to immediately end the conflict in Ukraine by undertaking immediate negotiations to permanently settle all disputes in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.@@@The billions and billions of dollars being spent in Ukraine on wanton destruction and war could have transformed for the better the economies, the livelihoods and the lives of millions and millions of people in the developing countries of the world if spent on poverty reduction and economic transformation.@@@It is from this perspective that Saint Lucia also laments the recent escalation of military tensions in the Taiwan Straits that threatened regional and international peace and security.@@@Saint Lucia therefore calls upon those responsible to observe the United Nations rules on peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all countries.@@@The people of Taiwan have freely determined their political status and ought to be allowed to continue on their chosen path to economic, social and cultural development and to confirm their right to self- determination.@@@Saint Lucia calls for the meaningful participation of Taiwan in the organs and agencies of the United Nations.@@@Further, in the interest of peace and stability in the contemporary global political environment, we continue to call for the reduction of tension and the normalization of relations with our regional neighbours Venezuela and Cuba.@@@In this regard, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations on a people’s right to self-determination and political independence, we once again call for the immediate removal of the inhumane economic embargo against Cuba.@@@Given the devastating impacts of the sanctions on the Venezuelan people, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and compounded by the expanding crisis of the world economy arising out of the war in Ukraine, let us also use this moment as a watershed for lifting the painful sanctions against the people of Venezuela.@@@Let us work together to open up a new period of prosperity for Latin America and the Caribbean.@@@In that vein, Saint Lucia wishes to register its grave concern over the continuing deterioration of the situation in Haiti.@@@We will continue to engage with the rest of the Caribbean Community family and the global community to facilitate a process towards normalization and, ultimately, the holding of free, fair and credible elections.@@@While Saint Lucia and the rest of the Caribbean are not manufacturers of conventional weapons, our countries have been plagued by a proliferation of illegal small arms and light weapons, resulting in a surge in criminal activity and gun violence.@@@Saint Lucia has always been a strong advocate of the international frameworks, such as the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects and the Arms Trade Treaty, which are two examples of multilateral instruments aimed at mobilizing international cooperation to curb the illicit trade in conventional arms and ammunition.@@@Saint Lucia calls on the major manufacturers, exporters and importers of conventional weapons in our hemisphere to live up to their commitments, under these instruments, to lend the necessary expertise and technical assistance and cooperate in good faith to stem the tide of unregulated conventional arms and ammunition.@@@In his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) on the future of global cooperation, the Secretary-General has proposed several significant initiatives with regard to the youth of the world.@@@The report recommends more meaningful and effective engagement with youth, including better political representation, transforming education, skills training and lifelong learning; and it proposes the establishment of a United Nations youth office and the appointment of a special envoy for future generations.@@@Saint Lucia welcomes these recommendations and is encouraged by the adoption of resolution 76/306, establishing the United Nations Youth Office, as they are in keeping with one of the key priorities of my Administration, which I highlighted in my inaugural address to the General Assembly — the creation of a youth economy (see A/76/PV.14, annex I).@@@I said then that this novel youth economy, which would be formalized in a new Government department under the purview of the Prime Minister, would be a catalyst for propelling our young people to turn their talents, skills and hobbies into economic enterprises for their own empowerment.@@@I am therefore pleased to announce that the legislation establishing our Youth Economy Agency has been passed and will be formally launched this year.@@@As we call upon Member States to support the United Nations Youth Office and the Secretary- General’s other proposals on youth, we once again invite the international community to discuss and engage with Saint Lucia on mutually beneficial relationships and projects to promote the youth economy.@@@In the face of today’s drastic interconnected crises, let us all together harness the immense energy, enthusiasm and creativity of our young people; let us capitalize on their resourcefulness; let us see them as assets and not as problems to be solved; let us consider their aspirations, for the future is theirs, not ours.@@@In this watershed moment, as we have described it, of interlocking challenges, we must all accept the truth that it is the ordinary people of this world who matter, the young in particular.@@@It is about the people whom we serve, who made us their leaders.@@@It is they, the people, who must come first in all that we do.@@@And so, we have gathered at this seventy-seventh session under the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” — a lofty and noble theme, indeed, pregnant with hope and towering expectations.@@@If we truly think of the people of this world, if we truly dedicate ourselves to serving them, then our words, our decisions and our actions will deliver better health care, decent employment and decent housing.@@@As world leaders, let us practice servant leadership by faithfully adhering to and fulfilling the obligations of the Charter of the United Nations to which we all agreed to abide when we became its Members.@@@Let us truly be nations united.@@@Let us transform our attitudes and approach to the less privileged.@@@The more powerful among us must honour international obligations and responsibilities.@@@Despite our small size, Saint Lucia stands here with the self-confidence of a people assured that our history and our own struggles for freedom have earned us the right to be a voice for all the developing and oppressed peoples of the world, and we are confident that we have something to share with the world at this time of crises.@@@“It has perhaps always been the case that the waging of peace is the hardest form of leadership of all.@@@I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together.”@@@(A/64/PV.105, p. 3)@@@That is a quote from the address delivered by Her Majesty the late Queen Elizabeth II to the General Assembly in 2010.@@@Today, on the International Day of Peace, I stand here to urge the world’s leaders to be faithful to the legacy of Queen Elizabeth II so that we can live in peace.@@@I am particularly pleased and honoured to greet my fellow Hungarian, the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@With his presidency, after 40 years Hungary is again serving as President of the General Assembly for one year.@@@It is a great honour for Hungary, especially in the current challenging situation.@@@I wish you.@@@Sir, every success in your work.@@@I stand before the Assembly today as the President of Hungary — the first woman President of my country, a wife and the mother of three children.@@@As a President and as a mother, I feel responsible for preserving the environment for the generations to come, in which they can enjoy security and comfort.@@@Today, on the International Day of Peace, I stand before the General Assembly to reaffirm our commitment, under Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations,
“[t]o maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace”.@@@Let us remind ourselves of the main reason that the United Nations was brought to life: peace.@@@We peoples and leaders of the Western world often pretend that we have lived in an age of permanent peace and prosperity since the end of the Second World War.@@@In many ways, that might be true — indeed, we live in a more peaceful and prosperous age than before.@@@Let us not forget, though, the wars and armed conflicts raging in many regions of the globe, which kill innocent people, tear apart families, destroy infrastructure and economies, turn well-kept agriculture fields into wasteland and add to the destruction of the world around us.@@@According to the Council on Foreign Relations’ Global Conflict Tracker, there are currently 27 ongoing conflicts worldwide.@@@The tracker categorizes conflict into three groups: “worsening,” “unchanging” and “improving.”@@@Right now, not a single one of those conflicts is described as “improving”.@@@Globally, conflict and violence are on the rise, according to the United Nations, which has warned that peace is under greater threat around the world now than it has ever been since the Second World War.@@@The number of wars and armed conflicts around the world has been rising steadily since then.@@@The scholarly optimism that the decline in the number of casualties might lead to a process whereby armed conflicts become irrelevant was quickly overshadowed by recent developments in Europe and other parts of the world.@@@I come from Hungary, from the heart of Europe.@@@Everyone would assume that, since the Second World War, peace has been a regional characteristic.@@@Let us not forget that, just 11 years after the end of Second World War, Soviet tanks were rolling along the streets of Budapest.@@@We had 45 years of communist dictatorship, and it did not take long after the peaceful change of regime in 1989 for war to break out in our immediate southern neighbourhood.@@@The killing lasted for a decade.@@@Now, after hardly more than 20 years, war is once again raging on the European continent, in one of Hungary’s neighbouring countries.@@@It fills us with particular concern, especially because ethnic Hungarians living across the borders have also shed their blood.@@@Russia’s war against Ukraine is a constant threat and security risk, not only for the Ukrainian citizens living in the war zone but for all of us.@@@The threat of escalation is a reason for worry and action.@@@Hungary firmly condemns Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, which has destroyed peace in Europe and caused dramatic human suffering and destruction, with serious repercussions for the world order.@@@Since the beginning of the conflict, Hungarians have stood with the victims.@@@We have provided economic, social and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and to the Ukrainian people fleeing the war.@@@Hungary is currently implementing the largest humanitarian operation in
its recent history.@@@Hungarian people, churches, civil organizations, local authorities and the Government have provided shelter to nearly 1 million refugees since the outbreak of the conflict.@@@We have learned that war is evil and leads nowhere.@@@A war has only victims, and those with the greatest losses are families: mothers and fathers who lose their children on the battlefield; wives who lose their husbands in the fighting; and children who lose their brothers and sisters in the hell of war.@@@It is in the strongest possible terms that we call for the investigation of war crimes committed against innocent civilians.@@@Those crimes must be documented, investigated and prosecuted by the relevant international institutions.@@@No crimes committed can go unpunished.@@@What do we want from the United Nations?@@@To win the war?@@@We should not stand for winning any war.@@@We need to stand for the restoration of peace.@@@If there is a will, there is a way.@@@Hungary is a member of several federal systems, including above all the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and the Council of Europe, among others.@@@Those organizations were created by their founding fathers to pursue peace as their fundamental goal.@@@I could say that they were created by the desire for peace, and I am convinced that the service of peace is the foundation of their identity.@@@Let me recall once again the words of the late Queen Elizabeth II,
“The aims and values which inspired the United Nations Charter endure: to promote international peace, security and justice; to relieve and remove the blight of hunger, poverty and disease; and to protect the rights and liberties of every citizen.”@@@(ibid., p.2)@@@Hungary urges fellow Member States to declare peace as the major priority in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine.@@@It is by no means self-evident that today, at a time of war, energy and food crises, the organizations set up to avoid war and preserve peace are focusing on ideological indoctrination.@@@That is not what is needed today.@@@Instead, we must regain our ability to distinguish between the essential and the irrelevant; the important and the unimportant; reality and fiction.@@@Most of us came to the Assembly from London.@@@We attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II together and bowed our heads before her coffin.@@@We bid farewell to an exceptional monarch, whose life was steeped in service to peace.@@@We owe it to the people and to her memory to make our decisions in the same spirit.@@@Let me conclude by quoting Winston Churchill, who said in 1953,
“Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace, and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war.”@@@Let us make a good peace.@@@It is my singular honour to deliver this statement to the Assembly.@@@Allow me to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@He can be assured of Zimbabwe’s full support as his guides our deliberations during the current session.@@@I also pay special tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for leading the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly as the world grappled with a plethora of challenges.@@@We commend him for the President of the General Assembly Fellowship for Harnessing Opportunities for Promoting Empowerment of Youth initiative towards enhancing youth interest, engagement and commitment in the work of the United Nations.@@@That will go a long way towards safeguarding the interests of future generations, as embodied in today’s youth.@@@Their voices must be heard across our Governments and within the United Nations.@@@Zimbabwe is privileged to be among the pioneering beneficiaries of the initiative.@@@Delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an urgent priority for us all.@@@Our theme for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, captures the importance of scaling up our actions, informed by the state of our world.@@@The number of
persons exposed to food insecurity continues to increase.@@@Meanwhile, the scourges of conflict and climate change have become major drivers of migration and refugees.@@@The ever-looming threat associated with the “triple C crisis” of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), conflict and climate change has placed upon us an enormous responsibility to confront these interlocking challenges by strengthening multilateralism and solidarity.@@@Terrorism, biodiversity loss, desertification, pollution and cybercrime, among other challenges, reinforce the urgent need to implement inclusive and transformative solutions that leave no one and no place behind.@@@The seventy-seventh session comes in the wake of the debilitating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which overstretched our health-care systems and severely exposed the disparities between developed and developing countries with regard to vaccine access.@@@Africa is among the most affected.@@@The lessons from the pandemic should inspire and enable the General Assembly to urgently scale up means to build multi-pronged capacities that must guide our collective response to future pandemics and other global challenges.@@@Despite the illegal economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe has successfully implemented its COVID-19 National Response Strategy, anchored largely by our own internal resources and institutional capacities.@@@The proactive approach of my Administration has enabled the country to achieve high vaccination rates, extending to children up to 12 years.@@@Meanwhile, our focus on the construction, rehabilitation and modernization of health facilities across the country, coupled with enhanced capacities around biotechnology and the pharmaceutical value chain, attests to my Government’s determination to realize universal health coverage.@@@Lifting many more people out of poverty and into a higher quality of life must remain at the core of both United Nations activities and the programmes and projects of our respective countries.@@@Zimbabwe has made significant strides towards ending poverty and hunger.@@@That has seen the implementation of various policies and programmes to support and empower communal and small-scale farmers.@@@At the household level, the provision of agriculture inputs, equipment and technical support to farmers, especially the vulnerable, has contributed to household and national food and nutrition security.@@@However, in 2022, mid-season drought and tropical cyclones regrettably reduced the overall performance of the agriculture sector.@@@To that end, the climate change conundrum has continued to be an albatross.@@@The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change should remain the primary platforms for negotiating our collective global response to climate change.@@@All measures taken to achieve the targets and commitments set under the Paris Agreement have to be implemented.@@@Furthermore, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances must also be reflected.@@@Financing for climate change has remained inadequate, leaving the scope for effective and just transition to renewable energy among developing countries under serious threat.@@@It is our hope that at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt later this year, the developed countries will deliver more concrete action on climate change, not just for mitigation targets, but also in relation to adaptation, loss and damage, climate-specific finance, technology transfer and capacity-building.@@@In our case, Zimbabwe is making concerted and deliberate efforts to integrate climate action into our national policies, strategies and planning.@@@That includes strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable in our society.@@@Additionally, my Government is implementing an ambitious programme to increase the number of dams for irrigation.@@@The programme is expected to create greenbelts across the country as we reduce dependence on rain-fed agricultural activities while enhancing export-led production and productivity.@@@Our comprehensive Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy is focused on increasing production and productivity across the agriculture spectrum.@@@That was instrumental in our unprecedented realization of national wheat self-sufficiency, as well as increased exports in horticulture.@@@The provision of technical extension services for improved land and water use has seen the widespread adoption of climate-smart agricultural innovations, with evident upward increase of incomes among communal and smallholder farmers, as well as women and youth in agriculture.@@@Zimbabwe is committed to 2030 Agenda and has, to that end, mainstreamed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our national economic development blueprint, the National Development Strategy.@@@We
acknowledge the support of the United Nations in the alignment of the Strategy with the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Economic reforms have been implemented, resulting in significant progress in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, mining and tourism.@@@Our “Zimbabwe is open for business” mantra has fostered strong partnership between the Government and the private sector for inclusive and sustainable development.@@@Massive infrastructure development projects, which include dams, energy plants and roads, have broadened our national economic asset base, as well as production and productivity enablers, while enhancing regional connectivity and integration.@@@The current global financial architecture has demonstrated its inadequacies in addressing the challenges that confront us.@@@An increasing and unsustainable debt burden, the prohibitive cost of borrowing, illicit financial flows and the exploitation of natural resources from developing countries have all combined to relegate developing countries to the periphery of the global financial system.@@@There is therefore a need for a global financial system that is just, more inclusive and responsive to the challenges we face.@@@Equally, the international trade architecture under the World Trade Organization has remained largely exclusive and indifferent to the needs of developing countries.@@@The African Continental Free Trade Area is thus expected to be the panacea for Africa in trading and stimulating economic growth and development.@@@The Free Trade Area must be complemented as we strive to improve production and trade in goods and services.@@@The liberalization of services and strengthening of competition policy and intellectual property rights, as well as the adoption of digital trade, should also be enhanced.@@@Education is a key driver of sustainable development with a direct impact on SDG 4, on quality education; SDG 5, on gender equality; and SDG 17, on partnerships for the goals.@@@Zimbabwe has embarked on reforms based on our Heritage Based Education 5.0 model, which emphasizes science, technology, innovation and industrialization.@@@Those are indeed necessary tools to leap forward the modernization and industrialization of our countries in the developing world.@@@My Government is equally providing quality, inclusive and accessible education through the roll-out of a phased, free primary school education system.@@@The Transforming Education Summit during this high-level week is a timely and welcome development that should help revitalize the education sector, even more so after COVID-19-induced disruptions.@@@My country notes that more work needs to be done globally to close the gender gaps that are often aggravated in times of crisis.@@@Opportunities are being created for all Zimbabweans, especially for women and youth, to realize their individual and collective potential.@@@Milestones have thus been achieved in the implementation of SDG 5 on gender equality, leading to expanded empowerment and employment opportunities for women and young people.@@@The proportional representation for women in Parliament is enshrined in the Constitution.@@@Under my leadership, Zimbabwe has legislated reserved youth seats in the National Assembly.@@@To further strengthen participatory democracy and good governance, my Government has introduced a 30-per cent quota for women in local authorities.@@@That is especially important as women bear the brunt of poor service delivery at the local level.@@@The establishment of gender and youth focal desks within Government ministries has helped to mainstream the issues of young people, particularly young women.@@@Sustainable socioeconomic development is an indispensable imperative for the enjoyment of the fundamental rights of any people.@@@The Policy on Devolution and Decentralization has seen increased budgetary support directly to local authorities.@@@Communities at the village, ward and district levels are now making independent decisions and prioritizing their programmes and projects, informed by the most pressing needs at their level.@@@That has seen the rapid construction of schools, clinics, water and sanitation infrastructure, and other social amenities in the most remote areas of Zimbabwe.@@@In the same vein, my Government is promoting heritage-based rural industrialization to guarantee improved livelihoods and incomes for all communities, based on their respective, unique natural resource endowments.@@@Zimbabwe is modernizing and industrializing based on our local resources and human capital base.@@@Inspired by the historic monument, the Great Zimbabwe, from which our country’s name is derived, we are building our country brick by brick, stone upon stone, with the support of our friends and partners.@@@As my Government continues to entrench democracy, good governance and the rule of law, we are committed to vibrant, competitive and peaceful political contestations.@@@Notwithstanding our success, the ongoing deleterious effects of the illegal sanctions continue to hamper and slow our progress and the realization of sustainable and inclusive development.@@@Zimbabwe is a peace-loving country.@@@We remain indebted to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and the African Union, as well as other progressive members of the comity of nations for their unwavering support and calls for the removal of these unwarranted and unjustified sanctions.@@@We once again call for their immediate and unconditional removal.@@@My country welcomes the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, who visited Zimbabwe in 2021.@@@At the international level, Zimbabwe has adopted an engagement and re-engagement policy.@@@The policy is underpinned by the principles of mutual understanding and respect, cooperation, partnership and shared values with other members of the international community.@@@We desire to be a friend to all and an enemy to none.@@@My country is greatly concerned that more than 20 years after the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, hate crimes, xenophobia, racial discrimination and intolerance have continued to increase at an alarming rate, including at the international level.@@@There is a need, therefore, to recommit to fighting those scourges in all their forms and manifestations.@@@The spread of terrorism and the intensification of old conflicts on the African continent and throughout the world have been a setback to our quest to silence the guns.@@@In southern Africa, we remain seized with insecurity and terrorist insurgency in northern parts of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique and conflicts in parts of the Great Lakes region.@@@Emboldened by our SADC regional philosophy that an injury to one is an injury to all, we continue to pool our resources to fight terrorism and other threats to peace, security and stability in our region.@@@We appeal to the United Nations to render the requisite support to our efforts to restore peace in the affected areas.@@@Zimbabwe stands committed to playing its part for the realization of peace and security within various United Nations, African Union and SADC peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions.@@@The scale and gravity of our challenges today cannot be addressed through old structures and old ways of doing business.@@@Zimbabwe subscribes to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration as the sustainable approach to the reform of the Security Council.@@@In conclusion, Zimbabwe reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and multilateralism in the resolution of the complex and intersecting challenges facing our world.@@@The implementation of the inclusive 2030 Agenda remains our biggest hope for the future we all want.@@@There is indeed a more compelling case for enhanced solidarity, cooperation and partnerships if we are to respond effectively to these challenges and ensure our collective survival.@@@The United Nations should remain the beacon and source of hope for the global citizenry.@@@As leaders, we have a weighty burden and responsibility to make the United Nations deliver to the expectations of all the peoples of the world.@@@I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@I also want to thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his determined and skilful leadership of the United Nations.@@@They can both count on Finland’s steadfast support for their important work during these exceptional times.@@@As the theme of this session states, the challenges we are facing are intertwined.@@@Russia is waging a
brutal war in Ukraine.@@@The ripple effects of that war are already far-reaching and severe.@@@They are compounding the pre-existing problems faced by the international community.@@@A triple crisis concerning energy, food security and finance is weighing heavily on vulnerable countries, countries that are already suffering the most from the climate crisis and the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@This truly is a watershed moment.@@@As we gather here, we have an important opportunity to engage in dialogue, to find solutions and to understand the concerns of those most in need.@@@As difficult as it may seem, now is the time to show global solidarity and strengthen multilateral cooperation.@@@The international community can and should emerge stronger from these crises.@@@Russia’s cruel and unprovoked war on Ukraine has now been raging for seven months.@@@It has brought immense sorrow and destruction to the sovereign lands of Ukraine.@@@Russia’s use of force is in blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It is an act of aggression, as determined by this very Assembly.@@@Ukraine is exercising its inherent right to self-defence and, judging by the recent reports from the battlefields, it is doing so with admirable courage, strength and efficiency.@@@We, the international community, members of the General Assembly, might not always see eye to eye.@@@We have our differing views, but it is our common obligation to uphold the international rules-based order.@@@We cannot accept, condone or normalize grave violations of international law and human rights.@@@A world where impunity prevails is unjust, unstable and dangerous for all of us.@@@There was a global food crisis even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.@@@More than 800 million people in the world were chronically hungry.@@@The war has further worsened this calamity.@@@I would like to commend the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye for their tireless efforts to reach an agreement to secure Ukrainian grain transports.@@@If implemented as foreseen, it will have a major impact on the lives of tens of millions of people in need.@@@In order to respond to the wider challenges of global food security, we need collective action.@@@The goal must be sustainable, inclusive and fair food systems.@@@We also have to accelerate the implementation of other Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We cannot afford to leave anyone behind.@@@Last year in this Hall, I noted that it is not an exaggeration to say that we are facing a global climate emergency (A/76/PV.4).@@@This summer has proven it.@@@We have seen extreme drought and heat waves across the globe, from the Horn of Africa to Europe, from China to the United States of America.@@@The magnitude of the catastrophe caused by the floods in Pakistan is not yet fully visible, but the destruction is already tremendous.@@@Those are not isolated or local events.@@@They are another a reminder that climate change is an existential threat to humankind.@@@We are on the verge of very dangerous tipping points.@@@That calls for urgent action on two fronts.@@@First, we must change our course before it is too late.@@@Secondly, we urgently need to help those suffering and support those with fewer resources to deal with this threat.@@@Besides mitigating climate change, we must adapt to it.@@@In particular, we must honour the commitment of doubling adaptation finance made at the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow.@@@I want to underline this — fighting climate change and taking care of the economy are not contradictory.@@@Green transition has a tremendous potential to create jobs, innovations and economic growth, but it has to be done fairly.@@@The alarming loss of the variety of life on our planet should also be a cause for grave concern to all of us.@@@We are on the brink of mass extinction, or perhaps are already there.@@@Again, we need to change course urgently.@@@We humans can thrive and survive only if we learn to coexist with all the other species.@@@We need to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.@@@To that end, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal in December will be essential.@@@Defending human dignity is a fundamental task of the United Nations.@@@It is up to us, the Member States, to live up to that task.@@@Despite our failures, we also have accomplishments to build on.@@@The Human Rights Council has shown determination.@@@It has worked to ensure accountability for the horrendous acts committed against civilians in Ukraine and Syria.@@@It has raised its voice in support of women and girls in Afghanistan.@@@I want to thank those who supported Finland’s membership of the Human Rights Council.@@@As a member, Finland acts to bring justice to the victims
of human rights violations.@@@Finland remains a staunch supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court in investigating all grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.@@@The number of conflicts in the world is the highest since the Second World War.@@@One-quarter of humankind lives in conflict-affected countries.@@@We must not ignore or forget Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen and other countries where human rights or the conditions for living a decent life are under threat.@@@Increasing geopolitical tensions, as well as the impacts of climate change and the pandemic, are making conflicts more complex and prolonged.@@@Ordinary people bear the brunt.@@@For the first time in its history, the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index has declined for two consecutive years.@@@We simply cannot let that continue.@@@In this turbulent world, those who stoke the flames of conflict bear a special responsibility.@@@But we all must ask ourselves: Have we done all we can to avert violence?@@@Have we done what we can to make a positive change?@@@Difficult times call for more diplomacy, not less.@@@We must build and strengthen peace and prevent conflict wherever possible.@@@That is the very core of the United Nations.@@@We also have to be able to respond to emerging threats to peace and security and to move from hindsight to foresight.@@@The report of the Secretary- General on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) provides us with a blueprint for more effective multilateralism, paving a way to solutions to current and future global problems and strengthening peace.@@@It really is our common agenda, and Finland wholeheartedly supports its implementation.@@@In the current security environment, the international arms control architecture is increasingly challenged.@@@On the one hand, political tensions erode the functioning of the existing architecture.@@@On the other hand, new technologies create new risks.@@@But we cannot let arms control fail.@@@On the contrary, it needs to be strengthened.@@@For decades, arms control has provided stability and predictability in great power relationships and international relations.@@@To quote Dag Hammarskjold, “disarmament is never the result only of the political situation; it is also partly instrumental in creating the political situation”.@@@The two biggest nuclear-weapon States have a unique responsibility to advance nuclear arms control and disarmament.@@@The others need to follow suit.@@@It is in the interest of all of us that progress in nuclear arms control and disarmament continue beyond the New START Treaty.@@@We call on the United States and the Russian Federation to continue their dialogue on strategic stability with a view to achieving further cuts in their nuclear arsenals.@@@The interlocking global challenges demonstrate that, more than ever, we need a renewed commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.@@@We must not become indifferent or apathetic in the face of these multiple crises.@@@We must not get used to violations of international law and human rights.@@@We must not close our eyes to the growing needs of the vulnerable.@@@We must not sleepwalk into a climate and biodiversity catastrophe.@@@Nor should we lose sight of hope.@@@There is still time to act.@@@I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly and assure you of my country’s full support during your presidency.@@@At last year’s general debate (see A/76/PV.6), I called on leaders to build a better world for those living today, and even more so for the generations yet to come.@@@Today I would therefore like to take everyone back to 1992, when Severn Cullis-Suzuki spoke at the Earth Summit — the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro.@@@She appealed to everyone to help stop the destruction of the Earth’s resources.@@@Now it is 2022, and the world in its current state does not need any more wake-up calls.@@@It is time for real action.@@@While some progress has been made, we have not yet succeeded in overcoming the challenges we face.@@@Meanwhile, the threats have been adding up: economic recovery from the coronavirus disease pandemic has slowed; the climate crisis is worsening, with extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and collapsing ecosystems; poverty and hunger are on the rise; and there is definitely a humanitarian crisis.@@@The global community is faced with escalating consumer and fuel prices that have risen substantially, damaging living standards, particularly for the vulnerable.@@@I therefore want everyone here to take a moment to ask themselves the following questions.@@@Have we treated the Earth in a sustainable way?@@@Are we better prepared for the next pandemic?@@@Has access to climate financing improved?@@@Have we addressed the root causes of the humanitarian crisis and unregulated migration?@@@Are we ensuring that the most vulnerable in our societies are being lifted out of poverty and hunger, and have we provided for their needs?@@@Are we taking enough action together as one?@@@We can all conclude that we are not ready and have not taken all the necessary measures.@@@And as the leader of Suriname, a small country and one of only three carbon-negative countries in the world, I appeal to everyone today to ensure that we all uphold our firm commitment to international principles and international law when addressing global challenges and threats.@@@Today I urge the United Nations to exert its important role and place in defence of those principles by using meaningful dialogue and constructive engagement as tools.@@@Such action will bring us closer to achieving our shared objectives in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and keeping our promise to leave no one behind.@@@No country is immune to the climate crisis.@@@Over the past few months, Suriname, has been affected by excessive rainfall, resulting in floods in many parts of the country.@@@Owing to the inflow of salt water, fertile agricultural land has been adversely affected, causing economic loss and impacting food security and rural livelihoods.@@@The Secretary-General, who visited Suriname in July, witnessed first-hand the effect of climate change on low-lying coastal States.@@@He lauded our nature-based solutions, such as preserving mangroves, rainforest and other essential ecosystems, and stated that the Caribbean is ground zero for the global climate emergency.@@@That is why it is time to act now.@@@We must deliver on the $100 billion commitment to climate finance for adaptation.@@@In that regard, we call for support for establishing a research agenda that will help the region understand the cost of climate change for different sectors and economies and for scaling up the means of implementation, including financing, particularly adaptation financing, capacity-building and technology transfer — without technology-dumping.@@@We call for a scaling-up of finance for adaptation and responses to loss and damage, in a way that prioritizes the access of Caribbean and small island developing States (SIDS) to grant and concessionary financing, in particular through bilateral channels.@@@We also call for the establishment of a loss-and- damage facility under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that would provide SIDS with resources to finance the losses and damage resulting from climate change.@@@In that regard, I commend the Secretary-General for his efforts to make the Adaptation Fund more accessible to the countries affected by climate change through his adaptation finance initiative.@@@Financing is the backbone of sustainable development.@@@The time has now come for a real reform of the global financial architecture, which must take into consideration the unique and inherent vulnerabilities that hamper the ability of small and vulnerable economies to overcome economic, environmental and social shocks.@@@I therefore welcome the appointment of the High-level Panel on the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index.@@@We look forward to finding solutions to address the obstacles to realizing the index, particularly the lack of reliable data.@@@The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Haiti remains of great concern to the region and requires the attention of the international community.@@@In my capacity as the current Chair of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), I am committed to taking every effort to engage in dialogue with all stakeholders in Haiti with the aim of safeguarding peace and security.@@@It is of the utmost importance that any support for resolving the situation in Haiti be based on a Haitian- initiated and -owned plan.@@@Conflicts and violence are currently on the rise globally in all regions, leading to hostilities and displacements and resulting in paralysing levels of poverty and food insecurity.@@@As States Members of the United Nations, we should take responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.@@@The achievement of sustainable development is inextricably linked to upholding democratic values, good governance and respect for human rights.@@@We must allow countries to develop sustainable economies, without obstacles.@@@In today’s world, differences must be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.@@@Therefore, in our view, the long-standing embargo against Cuba and the Cuban people must be lifted.@@@I believe that young people are valuable and undeniable partners in every aspect of development and in shaping the future.@@@In that regard, I would like to congratulate the Secretariat on the establishment of Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth.@@@As lead head of the quasi-cabinet of the Caribbean Community responsible for regional youth development, I was pleased with the interactions among the region’s young people at the most recent meeting of the Heads of Government of CARICOM held in Suriname.@@@I commend the young people of the region for shouldering responsibility and inspiring their peers to not only demand a seat at the table but also show up consistently.@@@For my part, I have pledged 10 hectares of land in Suriname to set up an innovative campus to facilitate research and development studies conducted by students and start-ups from the region.@@@Since I took office two years ago, my Government has made efforts to bring the economy back on track and guide our country’s development away from an extremely unsustainable position onto the right path.@@@Even though we have a homegrown recovery plan, a 36-month extended fund facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a national multi-year development plan currently under implementation, my Government continues to face economic challenges and capacity constraints, owing to external and unforeseen shocks.@@@The impact of several crises, coupled with economic reform measures, has brought great hardship to the population.@@@International support is therefore of critical importance.@@@Seeking to prevent further hardship and bring some relief to our population, we decided to re-engage with the IMF in order to consider where the implementation of our programme can be adjusted based on the current realities in the world and how to minimize its social cost.@@@We appreciate our bilateral and multilateral partners, who have expressed solidarity and provided valuable support to my country and people during these challenging times.@@@In addition, our goal is to attract investment and improve productivity and capital allocation, which are critical for growth and poverty reduction.@@@In conclusion, effective and consensus-based multilateralism is the only option for solving the interlocking challenges our world faces today.@@@National solutions to resolve global problems have time and again proven to be ineffective, and at times dangerous.@@@Global solutions with adapted local or national implementation will enable us to achieve the future we want.@@@We can, will and must do that together.@@@Together we are stronger.@@@God bless everyone.@@@Seventy-seven years ago, the Organization was founded out of the chaos of war with one stated aim: the harmonization of relations among nation States in pursuit of lasting peace and security, the defence of human rights and the inviolability of international law.@@@It was the world’s first multilateral response to the aggression of the few at the expense of the many.@@@And yet, in spite of all its successes, today our United Nations stands at a crossroads.@@@As the theme of this year’s General Assembly suggests, we face a watershed moment in world history.@@@We face a choice, and that choice is simple.@@@We can come together to face down the forces of authoritarianism and violence of today, in full cognizance that there is a price to pay for defending our common human values, or we can show indecision, we can waver and, ultimately, we can fold.@@@If we choose the former, however painful in the short term that may be, the values that underpin these United Nations will prevail; choose the latter and the consequences are, I believe, unimaginable.@@@For our societies to survive and thrive, they have to be willing to fight when faced with unprovoked aggression.@@@Pericles, in his funeral oration, made that absolutely clear 2,500 years ago.@@@At no time since the end of the Second World War have his words echoed more relevantly.@@@Today the memories of the dark continent have resurfaced after the unprovoked invasion of Russia into Ukraine.@@@What we considered unthinkable has happened.@@@For many years, we believed that international cooperation and a shared commitment to the rule of law had prevailed over guns and armies.@@@We believed that, given the tragic and devastating experiences of the twentieth century, no one would venture to suppress another people’s right to exist or alter borders by force.@@@We were wrong.@@@Nevertheless, as Europeans we have every reason to be proud of our response.@@@We have stood by Ukraine, equipping it with means to defend itself against the aggressor.@@@We have imposed punitive sanctions that are beginning to take a toll on the Russian economy.@@@And the tide is beginning to turn.@@@This clear and strong position against an unjustified war is the reflection of a new geopolitical vision for the European Union.@@@We do not want a world in which power is for the strong State and not for the weak, and where disputes are settled by generals rather than diplomats.@@@Russia’s invasion must not succeed, not only for the sake of Ukraine but also because it is imperative to send a clear message to other authoritarian leaders that open acts of aggression that violate international law shall not be tolerated by the global community of democratic States.@@@That message had been sent loud and clear by many Heads of State and Government who have taken the floor in this year’s general debate.@@@Across Europe, we face the prospect of a difficult winter.@@@The impact of the war in Ukraine has sent the price of gas soaring and has unleashed a spike in inflation, the likes of which we have not seen in more than four decades.@@@Russia has weaponized its natural resources to inflict pain on European societies and destabilize democratically elected European Governments.@@@Again, it will not succeed.@@@We will support our citizens in coping with high energy prices.@@@We will pool European resources to promote energy efficiency and rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and natural gas.@@@And we will further accelerate the push towards renewables, which are not just the cleanest and cheapest form energy, but are also the safest ones from a geopolitical perspective.@@@Never again must we mortgage our prosperity, only to be blackmailed by those who are willing to exploit our dependencies.@@@That is, after all, what European strategic autonomy is all about.@@@We know that there is a price to be paid for being on the right side of history, and it is our obligation to keep our societies united but also informed about what is really at stake in Ukraine.@@@The fight against disinformation and fake news must continue with increased vigour.@@@Pericles, in his funeral oration was correct when he said that it is not easy to find the right measure of words when one cannot quite rely on a common perception of the truth.@@@Ukraine is not the only country in post-war Europe to have been brutally attacked.@@@For nearly 50 years, Cypriots have lived on a divided island as the result of an illegal invasion and a military occupation.@@@Ankara and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership, isolated and alone in the international community, continue to insist upon unacceptable demands for a two-State solution.@@@They refuse to resume negotiations for an agreed settlement on the basis of successive Security Council resolutions.@@@Greece strongly supports both the Secretary-General’s efforts to resume negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement, and the confidence-building measures proposed by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Nicos Anastasiades.@@@But the international community must not ignore illegal Turkish attempts to impose a new fait-accompli on Cyprus, in particular in the fenced area of Varosha, as well as new and repeated violations of Cyprus’ maritime zones and airspace.@@@That brings me to an issue even closer to home for my country.@@@I am referring to Tiirkiye’s continued and ever-more aggressive revisionist agenda vis-a-vis Greece.@@@This is my fourth address to the General Assembly as Greek Prime Minister.@@@Members have heard me say before that I am always open to dialogue and to the settling of differences in an open, respectful manner and in accordance with international law.@@@That is still the case.@@@Tiirkiye after all is an important country, a NATO member that can be a partner and ally of Greece and the European Union if it so chooses.@@@Tiirkiye has a great capacity to play a constructive role.@@@For example, Ankara’s recent efforts that led to a successful United Nations brokering of a grain exports deal between Ukraine and Russia was an important contribution to global food security.@@@But at the same time, Tiirkiye continues to play a destabilizing role in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Caucasus.@@@It is also the only NATO country not implementing sanctions against Russia.@@@When it comes to Greece, Tiirkiye’s leadership seems to have a strange fixation with my country.@@@Their language is increasingly bellicose.@@@They threaten that Tiirkiye will “come at night”, if it so decides.@@@This is the language of an aggressor, not a peacemaker.@@@Sadly, it is nothing new.@@@And what of Tiirkiye’s challenge to Greek sovereignty in the Aegean itself?@@@Again, such rhetoric not new.@@@Tiirkiye has been incrementally building a comprehensive narrative of false claims in the Aegean that stretches from the Imia islet crisis in the mid-1990s to the present day.@@@It has been threatening Greece with a casus belli should we choose to exercise our sovereign right to expand our territorial waters in the Aegean.@@@That narrative has, unfortunately, culminated in Tiirkiye’s preposterous challenge last year of Greek sovereignty over the eastern Aegean islands, including islands such as Chios and Rhodes — a sovereignty that was established by international treaties 100 years ago.@@@What is particularly alarming is the growing intensity of the threat.@@@It is characterized by an escalation in aggressive rhetoric, combined with a massive disinformation campaign, multiple violations of Greece’s sovereignty and sovereign rights at sea and in the air, the instrumentalization of migration flows and, unfortunately, a unilateral decision to refuse all high-level contacts.@@@I ask: Is this behaviour compatible with a well- established international actor, a United Nations Member State bound by the Charter and principles of
the United Nations?@@@Such actions undermine peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean at a time when the international community is faced with a war in Ukraine.@@@If President Erdogan wants to talk about red lines, then I say this: Turkish claims over the sovereignty of Greece’s islands are baseless and unacceptable.@@@Questioning the sovereignty of Greek territory crosses a red line for all Greeks.@@@As Prime Minister of Greece, I will never compromise on my country’s territorial integrity, security and stability.@@@Greece will not be bullied by anyone.@@@And yet, it does not have to be that way.@@@There is another path forward.@@@Greek people and Turkish people have a history of peaceful coexistence.@@@Eight years after the tragic events of 1922, Greek and Turkish leaders had the courage to sign a peace and friendship agreement.@@@That is why today, from the United Nations, I would like to address not just the Turkish leadership but also the Turkish people directly with this message — Greece poses no threat to their country.@@@We are not their enemy.@@@We are neighbours.@@@We value the many friendships between ordinary Greeks and Turks.@@@I know that the vast majority in our two countries do not want political conflict and hostility, so let us move forward in a spirt of cooperation and friendship, with mutual respect and in accordance with international law.@@@Let me also make a specific reference to the migration situation in the Aegean.@@@Tiirkiye has been instrumentalizing migrants since March 2020, when it actively encouraged and facilitated tens of thousands of desperate people to illegally cross into Greece in order to put pressure on the European Union.@@@I want to be absolutely clear.@@@Greece will continue to protect its borders, with full respect to fundamental rights.@@@Our Coast Guard has saved tens of thousands of people at sea.@@@It did so again yesterday, when we rescued more than 130 people, including many children, from two sinking boats in the Aegean.@@@It would be much more useful for Tiirkiye to cooperate actively with Greece and Europe on the issue of migration rather than spreading fake news.@@@After all, the boats carrying the same desperate people to whom President Erdogan keeps referring leave the Turkish coast in broad daylight.@@@Let me conclude with a point about meeting the momentous challenges of climate change.@@@The green transformation sits at the heart of my Government’s reform programme.@@@Our National Climate Law is aimed at mobilizing all sectors of the economy as we establish a road map for our transition to net zero by 2050.@@@The conversion of a number of Greek islands into green innovation hubs is up and running.@@@And for Greece there is another fight close to our hearts.@@@It is the battle to protect cultural heritage, not just from climate change, but from armed conflict, illicit trafficking and its interconnection with terrorist financing, and religious fundamentalism.@@@Greece, in partnership with UNESCO and the World Meteorological Organization, has launched the Addressing Climate Change Impacts on Cultural and Natural Heritage initiative, supported by more than 100 Member States, the Secretary General, the Council of Europe and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We invite all Member States to join us in this effort.@@@I am pleased to say that in our long and continuing effort to reunite the Parthenon sculptures back in Greece, we have received support from the vast majority of Member States, as well as from the UNESCO@@@Intergovernmental Committee.@@@We thank them for that support.@@@No matter how long it will take, the Parthenon sculptures will eventually be coming home.@@@I am immensely proud of the fact that Greece is one of few countries that have not deviated from the United Nations 17 Sustainability Goals for 2030.@@@Let me highlight in particular our commitment to transforming public education, in line with Goal 4.@@@Our efforts have been recognized at this year’s Assembly.@@@As the world’s leading shipping nation, we understand that the sustainability of our marine environment is of paramount importance.@@@That is why, in 2024, we will be hosting the ninth international Our Ocean Conference, building on our ambitious plans to promote sustainable fishing and protect 30 per cent of our land and sea by 2030.@@@All these initiatives prove that collective multilateral solutions can make a significant difference in the battle to protect our natural world.@@@But, as many speakers have pointed out, we are not there yet.@@@Whether it be the terrifying wildfires we witnessed in Europe this summer, or more recently the unprecedented flooding that have affected large parts of Pakistan or the continued loss of critical icecaps, glaciers and rainforests, without multilateral cooperation these events may soon be the norm rather than the exception.@@@Greece is taking the lead in making sure that European countries cooperate more effectively in the field of civil protection through the rescEU programme.@@@As the United Kingdom hands on the baton and the work of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference, we have a final chance to get this right.@@@Let us not be asking at the next General Assembly why we are still talking and not acting.@@@The challenges our world faces our complex and multifaceted.@@@The solutions are far from simple.@@@They require compromise, effort and will.@@@They require resolve and determination.@@@Above all, they require us to work together and stay the course.@@@That, after all, is the spirit of these United Nations.@@@In pursuit of freedom, the preservation of democracy and the rule of law, and the fight against climate change, there is indeed a long road ahead.@@@The next generation will judge us very harshly should we fail to rise to the occasion.@@@It is a particular honour for me to address this session of the General Assembly because I stand here as the representative of a country, Albania, that is currently serving on the Security Council for the first time in its history.@@@That responsibility lends special importance to our role in this organ and beyond.@@@We gather here each September, and 77 years since its establishment, the United Nations has only gained in its universal appeal, serving as the parliament of humankind, the forum where we speak to each other and listen to the world.@@@Like nowhere else, the world converges here.@@@We share our successes and progress, outline issues and challenges, express worries and fears, highlight crises and tensions, and talk about agreements and discords, but above all we bring a joint desire for a better world.@@@In these nearly eight decades, we have witnessed uninterrupted change, profound transformation, unprecedented mobilization, continued solidarity and an all-time imperative of the need to work together.@@@As a result, the world has known undeniable progress on many tracks.@@@On the other hand, we must never forget that our journey has been bumpy.@@@Many times, we have also witnessed terrible setbacks and even reversals of progress.@@@Unfortunately, this is mainly due to man-made catastrophes, ill-conceived policies based on narrow national politics and short-sighted interests fuelled by populism, nationalism and greed for domination.@@@That is why this place at this time each year is the yearly check-up of the health of the world.@@@We may sometimes have the impression that we say too much of the same thing and that we needlessly and too often repeat each other.@@@I disagree.@@@If committing to peace and security, to development and prosperity, to upholding international law and respecting human rights or to engaging in genuine efforts to mitigate climate change is repeating each other, then we are doing the right thing.@@@Unfortunately, this year our hopes and beliefs have been bitterly shattered and our assurances broken by an unprovoked, unjustified and premeditated war of one country against another on the European continent — the brutal aggression of Russia against its neighbour, Ukraine.@@@Russia’s war of choice is against Ukraine and its people; not only that, but it is also a brutal assault on international Law, a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a very direct threat to the European security architecture.@@@It is an open battle between an aging, cynical tyranny and a young, growing democracy.@@@While we all, in our own way and with our respective means, try individually and collectively to project ourselves into the future, one country, led by an illusion of grandeur from bygone times, has decided to drag the world backwards and go against everything we have built over decades.@@@This is unacceptable.@@@We will continue to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people, and, like many other countries, help them in any way we can to defend themselves.@@@Their fight is also ours, and I hope that all Members of the United Nations share the core principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and the right to independently decide on their own future, without fear or interference.@@@Shying away from this defining battle between those principles and all their antitheses is shying away from the duty to protect ourselves, our countries and our children.@@@While the world expects Russia to come to reason, stop the war and engage in peace negotiations, just a few days ago the Kremlin made another choice, that of escalation, announcing a partial mobilization that would deepen the conflict and bring more crimes, more victims and more misery, but also more shame on Russia itself.@@@Sham referendums are being conducted in some parts of the occupied Ukrainian under the threat of the gun.@@@It is hard to imagine that anyone here can silently accept such disgraceful disregard of laws, rules, norms and practices that govern relations among States in the twenty-first century.@@@These actions run contrary to international law and not only do not reflect the free will of the Ukrainian people but also offer a miserable show of detachment from everything that brings us together under the roof of the United Nations.@@@We condemn such actions engineered in Moscow and will not recognize any such lawlessness.@@@In the world we want, impunity should not be a shelter for those who must answer for their deeds.@@@Albania is fully committed to accountability globally and to fighting impunity everywhere, not only to provide justice to victims but also to prevent future atrocities.@@@That is why Albania calls for and supports work towards the adoption of a convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity.@@@That new instrument would fill a significant gap in the current international framework and facilitate international cooperation to protect civilians.@@@The world is never a quiet place and there are many serious challenges that need to be properly and immediately addressed.@@@We face serious challenges from open conflict in many parts of the world.@@@Many countries are subject to intolerable seizure of power by force.@@@Terrorism remains a serious threat to peace and security.@@@At a time when a multitude of crises have plunged the world into turmoil, including from unacceptable nuclear threats, I would like to call the attention of the Assembly to another crucial issue, closely linked and with a huge impact on peace and security: cybersecurity.@@@Technology is nowadays part of every aspect of our lives.@@@In Albania, 95 per cent of services to the citizens and business are offered online.@@@These user-friendly systems save time and energy, drastically improve efficiency and quality, and are the best tool to eliminate endemic corruption.@@@Last July, however, Albania was the target of an unprovoked, large-scale cyberattack.@@@The Government’s entire digital infrastructure was under sustained and coordinated assault, with the clear aim of destroying it, paralysing public services, stealing data and electronic communications from government systems, creating chaos and fomenting tension in the country.@@@A lengthy and thorough in-depth investigation, conducted in cooperation with the best existing world expertise on cyberterrorism, has now confirmed beyond any doubt that the cyberattack that sought to bring a sovereign country to its knees was a State-sponsored aggression, orchestrated and carried out by the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@This is why, in the face of a such blatant breach of the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in peacetime, which include refraining from damaging critical infrastructure that provides services to the public, the Government of Albania was left with no other choice but to sever diplomatic relations with Iran.@@@We hope that this forced extreme measure will be an example and a deterrent to anyone who supports or sponsors such abhorrent actions against sovereign States.@@@We urge the United Nations, including the Security Council, to focus more seriously and concretely on addressing cybersecurity by investing in prevention and helping Member States build resilience.@@@Albania is a member of the Balkan community, a part of Europe that has had its share of very troubled history.@@@One need only mention the word “Balkans” and, I would bet, images stained by bloody wars and brutal crimes will come to everyone’s mind.@@@One would rightly recall the scars of repression and oppression, genocide in Srebrenica and brutal ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.@@@None of that is or will be forgotten.@@@Accountability has and will continue to be called for, and we must redouble our efforts to guarantee its unhindered course.@@@This requires a resolved commitment to the ideals of justice and, above all, to cooperation between parties.@@@Justice lies in the foundations of any effort for long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity.@@@But justice is served with facts, proof and evidence, not with fiction or distorted reality.@@@I cannot but share here a terrible example of that, which should serve as a lesson to all the word and, first and foremost, the democratic world.@@@In 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a report, compiled by a zealous parliamentarian who goes by the name Dick Marty, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army of the despicable crime of organ trafficking.@@@Mr. Marty should have been paid as a storyteller, but never trusted as a rapporteur of the Council of Europe.@@@His report was shocking, and not only did many believe it at the time, but it became the key factor in enhancing the idea of and establishing the Kosovo Specialist Chambers.@@@It also became one of the worst cases of distorted reality, a kind of manifesto for worldwide propaganda against Kosovo’s independence.@@@Every investigative effort has been made during these 11 long years to prove those allegations nationally, regionally and internationally — to no avail.@@@Nothing — not a single shred of evidence or proof — was found anywhere, in Kosovo or anywhere else, regarding the alleged trafficking of organs.@@@Yet, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, which were founded on the basis of that report, arrested Kosovo’s sitting President, Hashim Thagi, without indictment.@@@He waited a year in detention until he was formally indicted.@@@I would ask everyone here to imagine for a moment their president, prime minister or country leader being removed from office in a third country and kept there in custody for a whole year without any formal indictment by a body created and sponsored by a community of democratic countries.@@@And guess what?@@@Not a single word of the entire indictment that came next has anything to do with the Council of Europe’s report on the alleged crime of organ trafficking.@@@It is a complete fantasy.@@@Is this not a monumental failure of international politics?@@@This is not about a person.@@@It is not about a court procedure.@@@This is about inflicting an undue stain on a country and its history.@@@Nevertheless, exactly because democracy and its institutions have, among many virtues, that of repairing their faults and errors, we strongly believe that, based on this crying lack of any evidence whatsoever, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe will honour the truth and accept Albania’s request to produce a follow-up report and, although the damage has been done, help restore the credibility of such an important international organization as the Council of Europe.@@@We will never give up on this truth, and we will not stop honouring all of those who have given their lives for freedom and independence, and against whom nobody, in anybody’s name, can cast a single speck of dirt.@@@I will say a few more words on the Western Balkans, not of the past but of the future — the one that we are working to build together.@@@You need only turn that region in any way you want, and you will find a lot of fuel for division and toxicity.@@@But we in Albania have realized that the best way to advance is to do so together, with shared benefits as sovereign countries but close partners; as national players joined by a common enterprise, with our specific interests as part of a common framework that responds to our citizens.@@@This brought us, together with North Macedonia and Serbia, to launch the Open Balkans initiative, a platform open to all Balkan countries — not just the three of us but Montenegro and Kosovo, Bosnia and Tiirkiye, Greece and further — as an investment for everyone and part of the wider, common European project.@@@The best message of the Open Balkans that I want to share today is that you do not need to agree on everything to leave a dark past behind and build step by step a common, bright future by dealing with your disagreements in an increasingly gracious way and by finding ever more good reasons to resolve those disagreements.@@@By strengthening its relations with Serbia and moving forward together to boost bilateral and regional cooperation, Albania has not and will not move an inch from its firm position in support of the need for every country represented here that has not yet done so, including first and foremost Serbia, to recognize the Republic of Kosovo.@@@It is high time for Kosovo and Serbia to move beyond the current stalemate in their dialogue and to work bravely towards a comprehensive peace agreement by doing their respective parts to adopt a breakthrough document backed by the European Union and the United States.@@@Dialogue is not just a better way; it is the sole and unique way to deal with issues, however difficult they may appear, however complex they may be.@@@I remain convinced that Open Balkans will only help facilitate this process, to the benefit of all: Albanians and Serbs, Kosovo and Serbia, but also for the entire region and the wider Europe.@@@Despite all the worries and challenges that keep us awake at night, we should not lose hope, we should keep trying and renew efforts in order to put universality at the heart of what we say and what we do at the national, regional and global levels.@@@More than ever, in today’s shaken world, we need to commit ourselves to our fundamental universal values and acknowledge that we constitute a community of fate, despite our different national perspectives and interests.@@@Global warming will not distinguish between North and South, and the rise of the sea level will not stop at any shore.@@@If the pandemic that shook the world to the core, has taught us anything, it is a very simple lesson, that no one is immune until everyone is.@@@It is in that spirit that Albania acts in the region, in Europe, including here, at the General Assembly and in the Security Council, that the world expects rightfully to deliver, to stand up and save lives, to prevent and re-solve conflict not to be paralyzed or held hostage.@@@Let me conclude by quoting a beautiful African proverb, which says it all about our United Nations: “If you want to go fast, go alone.@@@If you want to go far, go together.”@@@On behalf of the African Union, I would like to express my thanks to your predecessor, Mr. President, and to wish you every success in presiding over this session.@@@I reiterate our support to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in carrying out his delicate mission in the service of Member States.@@@Since the previous session, the world has become more dangerous and uncertain, under the combined grip of global warming, security and health perils and the war in Ukraine.@@@The theme of this session reflects the urgent need to act together to ease tensions, heal our planet, reduce persistent North-South inequalities and reinstate the importance of multilateralism.@@@The Security Council is called upon, first and foremost, to address all threats to international peace and security, including in Africa, in the same way.@@@Terrorism, which is gaining ground on the continent, is not just an African matter.@@@It is a global threat that falls under the primary responsibility of the Council, as guarantor of the collective security mechanism under the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We therefore urge the Council to engage more with us in the fight against terrorism in Africa, with more appropriate mandates and more substantial resources.@@@Furthermore, the African Union once again calls for the lifting of foreign sanctions against Zimbabwe.@@@Those harsh measures continue to fuel a sense of injustice against an entire people and to aggravate their suffering in these times of deep crisis.@@@In the Middle East, we reiterate the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders.@@@We call for de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine with a view to achieving a negotiated solution in order to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict.@@@Negotiation and discussion are our most effective weapons in the promotion of peace.@@@I call for a high-level mediation mission, to which the African Union stands ready to contribute.@@@Nearly 80 years after the birth of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions, it is time for a fairer, and more inclusive global governance that is better adapted to the realities of our time.@@@It is time to overcome reluctance and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles.@@@It is time to do justice to Africa’s just and legitimate demand for Security Council reform, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus.@@@In the same vein, I recall our request for the African Union to be granted a seat in the Group of 20 (G-20) so that Africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion Africans are being taken.@@@I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the partners who have already expressed their support and invite others to give favourable consideration to our candidacy.@@@With respect to economic and financial governance, I draw the attention of the General Assembly to the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2022, produced by some 60 multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the Financial Stability Board.@@@The report highlights shortcomings in the assessment processes of credit rating agencies and underlines the importance of transparent methodologies so as not to undermine confidence in ratings.@@@We are concerned that the perception of risk in Africa continues to be higher than the actual risk, which increases the cost of insurance premiums and undermines the competitiveness of our economies.@@@That is why Africa is renewing its proposal to the
Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to engage, in conjunction with the G-20, the IMF and the World Bank, in a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies on improving their working and assessment methods.@@@In the same spirit, in view of the unprecedented scale of the global economic crisis, the African Union reiterates its call for the partial reallocation of special drawing rights, which are critical for developing countries, and the implementation of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative.@@@This unprecedented shock further destabilizes the weakest economies and makes their need for liquidity even more pressing in order to mitigate the effects of widespread inflation and to support the most vulnerable households and social strata, especially young people and women.@@@In addition, there is the need to address new and old health emergencies, including cancer, a silent killer that continues to claim millions of lives across the world.@@@I call for general mobilization for the Rays of Hope campaign of the International Atomic Energy Agency in order to strengthen the capacities of Member States, particularly in Africa, in the fight against cancer using nuclear technologies, such as medical imaging, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.@@@With the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm El-Sheikh only a few weeks away, Africa reiterates its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@At the same time, we hope to reach a consensus for a fair and equitable energy transition, as called for at the African Union-European Union Summit in February at the expanded session of the Group of Seven Summit in June and, recently, at the Africa Adaptation Finance Forum, in Rotterdam.@@@It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that is the furthest behind in the industrialization process and is the least polluting, should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity.@@@I recall that today more than 600 million Africans still live without electricity.@@@Let us also work towards the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year to support developing countries’ adaptation efforts and to finance the African Adaptation Acceleration Programme under the auspices of the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation.@@@Moreover, we see adaptation funding not as aid but as a contribution by industrialized countries to a global partnership of solidarity in return for efforts by developing countries to avoid the polluting patterns that have plunged the planet into the current climate emergency.@@@Beyond the current emergencies, I have come to convey the message of a continent that is committed to working with all its partners in a spirit of trusting dialogue and mutual respect.@@@I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough from the burden of history and that it does not want to be the breeding ground for a new Cold War, but rather a centre of stability and opportunity open to all its partners on a mutually beneficial basis.@@@I have come to say that we are not blind to an Africa faced with challenges where it is necessary to bring about peace and stability.@@@But I have also come to say that we also see Africa as a provider of solutions, with its 30 million square kilometres, its human resources, more than 60 per cent of the world’s arable land and its mineral, forest, water and energy wealth.@@@We have an Africa of solutions, with Governments daily on the job, a dynamic youth who innovate, take the initiative and succeed and millions of men and women who work hard to feed, educate and care for their families and who invest, create wealth and generate jobs.@@@This Africa of solutions wants to engage with all its partners in a reinvented relationship that transcends the prejudice that whoever is not with me is against me.@@@We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences, because the United Nations system, born out of the ashes of war, can win the support of all only on the basis of shared ideals, not home-grown values established as universal norms.@@@It is by working together, while respecting our differences, that we will restore strength and vitality to the raison d’etre of the United Nations, namely, to save present and future generations from the scourge of war, to advance the peaceful coexistence of peoples and to foster progress by creating better living conditions for all.@@@I wish the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly every success.@@@I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your excellent leadership and the important theme chosen for this session, which invites us to reflect at a critical time in history to address the various crises that are affecting the peaceful coexistence of humankind.@@@We have come to think that wars lead to the society of nations that led to the establishment of the United Nations, that peace was going to be forever and that the achievements of social conquests that cost humankind so much would be forever.@@@But, over the years, we woke up from that dream to find ourselves in a divided world, tainted and at odds.@@@Today we need to come together to seek solutions, not cease to find them, to once again speak out and to once again discuss and debate.@@@But this time it cannot be once again, This time we need to look around us and take a decisive step forward.@@@It is now or never.@@@With the same will with which we addressed the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic less than two years ago, with that same momentum, we have worked to overcome its effects and the consequence of other global events that have shown how interdependent we are as human beings.@@@The threat of COVID-19 remains, but not to the extent of the critical phase of the pandemic, when many countries faced serious problems by not having equitable access to the global vaccines market.@@@Tens of thousands of lives could have been saved.@@@However, in many cases, the hoarding of vaccines was a reality.@@@COVID-19 showed us that there are situations and threats that do not recognize borders or groups, that all States in the world are vulnerable and that we are not prepared to deal with globally, and especially cooperatively.@@@However, it is important to emphasize that we can succeed if we join forces.@@@Striking a balance between the health of people and the economy in the midst of the pandemic and always seeking the common good is one of the great challenges we have taken on — with very good results.@@@The Guatemalan Government adopted a countercyclical fiscal policy and a prudent monetary and credit policy that contributed to the early recovery of economic activity, with an 8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 2021.@@@That growth has been corroborated and highlighted by the three main credit rating agencies and other international organizations.@@@We also face the constant threat of the effects of climate change, which are becoming more evident, dangerous and extensive every year.@@@According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, those have exceeded the damages in my country since 1998 by more than $6 billion.@@@As we did last year, Guatemala and the rest of Central America and the Caribbean want to call attention to the ravages caused by climate change in our region.@@@We continue to recover from the damage caused by natural disasters this year and in previous years without the industrialized world, which is the real culprit of this catastrophe, responding with solutions to what they have caused.@@@In Guatemala we have made efforts to rehabilitate basic services, rebuild public infrastructure and recover agricultural and livestock production.@@@We have assisted entire communities.@@@My country is megadiverse, one of 20 countries that is home to more than 70 per cent of the planet’s biological diversity and constantly faces threats that endanger the natural heritage, not only of Guatemala but of humankind.@@@My Government has given new impetus to forestry concessions in the department of north Peten.@@@In January 2020, there were a total of 250,000 hectares under concession that form the Maya Biosphere Reserve, one of the main lungs of the continent and the world.@@@Previous Administrations did not pay attention to the renewal of those forest concessions.@@@In just two and a half years, my Administration doubled them, reaching
approximately 550,000 hectares, which, in addition, benefit thousands of families, who do not pillage the forest, but rather protect it, even against fires and those who live off the forest with adequate forestry plans.@@@The model of forest concessions in charge of communities really works.@@@It enables local economic development and is a barrier against the impact of climate change.@@@That has been recognized by nations and important environmental protection groups.@@@Similarly, agricultural insurance was implemented in order to support small producers who, due to drought or flooding caused by climate change, are in danger of losing everything and must emigrate if they do.@@@With that insurance, they recover their investment and can continue to grow their crops.@@@More than 50,000 farmers have already been reached, and many thousands remain.@@@With a view to meeting our climate change mitigation commitments, we are promoting the formulation of a national decarbonization policy.@@@In addition, we updated our nationally determined contribution and are promoting important strategies that, in the medium term, will help mitigate the impact of emissions from vehicles that use fossil fuels.@@@Proof of that is the recent approval, at the behest of the executive branch, of a law on incentives for electric mobility, which promotes the use and marketing of electric vehicles and cleaner energy.@@@Guatemala continues to comply with its own energy policy.@@@We estimate that, by the year 2032, more than 80 per cent of Guatemala’s electrical energy will be produced from renewable sources.@@@In addition, the growing crisis of food and nutritional insecurity is leaving us more famine and more lives to mourn, with the indolence of countries that have more towards countries that have little or nothing.@@@The irregular migration process is a multicausal phenomenon.@@@People migrate in search of better opportunities and better services.@@@The economic factor and the effects of climate change are some of the main causes.@@@Our Government has worked on structural rather than short-term solutions, not short-term ones, which, looking to the future, is the only thing that can stop irregular migration.@@@To that end, we enacted a series of laws that stimulate investment with the necessary legal certainty that enables job creation in order to meet the basic needs of the population, as well as a law that supports access to low-income housing.@@@It is important to emphasize that only a comprehensive effort of that nature will prevent people from resorting to irregular migration, and thereby put their lives and scarce assets at risk.@@@The smuggling of migrants has become a national and transnational security issue.@@@In Guatemala we have stopped massive irregular flows of migrants, better known as caravans, coming from countries in and out of the region.@@@That is always done in full respect for human rights.@@@In that connection, at the initiative of the executive branch, the law against the smuggling of migrants, known as the “law of coyotaje”, was adopted.@@@Smuggling is a transnational crime, so I once again call on parties in the region, and especially the Governments of the region — be they countries of origin, transit or destination — to work together and to adopt a common approach to irregular migration and the necessary legislation in that regard.@@@We are facing a decisive moment.@@@If we employ a shared approach, we will be able to reach transformative solutions to interconnected challenges, including those related to regional and transnational security.@@@We continue with the all-out war against drug trafficking, and I call on the consumer countries, which — as I said in my statement last year (see A/76/ PV.6) — are the ones that launder the most money.@@@Unless the financial structures of the organizations dedicated to this crime — the proceeds of drug consumption — are not weakened, it will continue to be a threat to the future of countries such as ours.@@@State sovereignty is fundamental in bilateral and multilateral relations.@@@No matter how big or small the countries, relations must be based on respectful treatment.@@@Let us remember that no country, organization or multilateral entity can or should intervene in the internal affairs of other countries — but no, that is not always the case.@@@Globally, we are facing new crises, and many of them, unfortunately, are caused willingly by humans by disrespecting the sovereignty of States.@@@This Organization must be more active in addressing the possibility of a third confrontation of major proportions.@@@However, the United Nations, as the guardian of international law and the centre for dialogue for the maintenance of peace and security among States, will not be able to solve the world’s problems without our
commitment — the State representatives — to respect international law and resolve our differences peacefully, on the basis of dialogue and negotiation, respecting the sovereignty of each State.@@@We are facing distressing levels of old hatreds, clear discriminatory rejection of nationalities, migrants and refugees, as well as other facts not seen since the end of the Second World War.@@@Once again, we are witnessing scenarios of the use of force and violence of one State against another, nationalist ideological confrontations, the imposition of authoritarian views, with a clear rejection of democracy as a system, as well as massive human rights violations.@@@In that sense, Guatemala emphatically joins the global clamour for the cessation of the war in Ukraine and the threats against the sovereignty of Taiwan and Israel.@@@We cannot allow the conflict in Ukraine to continue.@@@I went to Ukraine@@@and I know it to be true — this conflict must stop now.@@@We must not allow this situation to be repeated in any country.@@@As President of Guatemala, I am the only Latin American Head of State to have visited Ukraine during this conflict.@@@I saw the horrors of war, and I stand in solidarity and openly express my opposition to war — there or anywhere.@@@During the official visit, we were able to witness on the ground the precarious situation of the families of the country under attack, whose defenceless civilian population suffers the onslaught of a military force, including constant bombardment.@@@But peace is not the absence of war.@@@A renewed United Nations Organization is called upon to generate conditions in the world that allow for the full development and well-being of populations.@@@As I stated recently in my speech in the city of Kyiv, I would like to refer to and pay attention to the words of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@This Organization was created in order to
“save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained”.@@@The Charter further states:
“And for these ends to practice tolerance and
live together in peace with one another as good
neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain
international peace and security”.@@@In view of the current world scenario, we urgently need to remember those purposes and principles that gave rise to this Organization and allow for the transformation of this organ in order to have more tools and resources to overcome global challenges.@@@Profound changes in the Security Council are urgent in order to assure the world of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the self- determination of peoples, but, above all, to guarantee peace.@@@As a country with a pacifist vocation, Guatemala reiterates its request that the Security Council honour its responsibility without ideological bias, but, above all, that no countries can veto draft resolutions if they do not seek the authentic maintenance of peace.@@@The project of change cannot be postponed.@@@The foundations of the United Nations must be modified so that it has the mechanisms that will enable it to respond to the main challenges of humankind, which so desperately needs peace and development.@@@Guatemala calls on States to make rapid progress on a proposal, led by country experts, in order to define the fundamental reforms needed for the United Nations to return to the path it lost after its establishment in 1945.@@@The founding Charter, which came into being at the end of the Second World War and was amended on three different occasions, requires new approaches in keeping with the current times, which are difficult, but also full of opportunities.@@@The United Nations must secure the means to reform original commitments ranging from the sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations, including nuclear and chemical weapons of mass destruction.@@@While reforms to the United Nations and the Security Council are being proposed, Guatemala urges nations to respect the founding Charter of the highest world Organization.@@@In addition to the United Nations reform initiative, supported by the majority of pacifist and democratic countries, measures must be taken in order to achieve drastic changes in key institutions of multilateralism, leaving aside ideologies that divide us and addressing the interconnected challenges faced by the world’s
population.@@@Hunger and poverty have no ideology.@@@We must focus on comprehensive development and provide transformative solutions to the great challenges.@@@Guatemala, one of the founding countries of the United Nations, has demonstrated its support and is ready to collaborate with an open spirit in the efforts to transform this Organization and multilateralism related to the bastion of international cooperation so as to include within those reforms the right of Taiwan to belong to this Organization and to be recognized as a nation, because it has been denied that right by one of the permanent members on the Security Council.@@@I want to state emphatically that peace is possible, and the commitment to its maintenance and international security is achievable.@@@But we must voluntarily change our decisions and, as leaders, determine the direction and future of our societies.@@@Let us seek peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations, set aside ethnic, cultural, social or religious differences and focus on what unites us.@@@Let us be tolerant and respect different ways of thinking.@@@Guatemala is a peaceful country.@@@We promote respect for, and compliance with, human rights, of the right to life since conception to natural death.@@@Today, before this Assembly, I once again reaffirm my country’s firm commitment to serve continuously in the maintenance of peace in the world.@@@I want to reiterate that Guatemala, as a democratic country, is committed to permanently and definitively resolve before the International Court of Justice the territorial, insular and maritime dispute with Belize.@@@We aspire to a privileged relationship with Belize for the peaceful settlement of common issues through dialogue, building diplomatic mechanisms on the basis of mutual trust in order to bring prosperity, calm and hope to our populations.@@@Guatemala shares the same interests and challenges with its Caribbean brothers, with whom we unite in a single voice to fight against climate change and its effects.@@@It is time to look beyond and remember the horrors of the two great wars that caused so much pain to the world.@@@For the love of all that is sacred — it is now or never.@@@No more fratricidal wars, no more unnecessary and unjustified conflicts, no more deaths.@@@It is now or never.@@@For the love of all that is sacred — let us bet on peace, let us bet on dialogue, let us bet on resolving problems as brothers do.@@@It is now or never.@@@Let us bet on peace.@@@Succeeding generations and the preservation of the human race will thank us for it.@@@Let us concern ourselves with the real battles — fighting hunger, malnutrition, confronting climate change and so many other issues that affect the human race.@@@Instead of taking up arms, let us take action to make the world a better place to live in peace, progress, development and peaceful coexistence between human beings and nature.@@@In these dark and difficult times, I raise my prayer for God to bless the entire world, but especially Guatemala.@@@As I take the floor on behalf of the Central African Republic at the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, I would first like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his outstanding election as President of the Assembly.@@@His flawless knowledge of the international arena and his personal qualities are an asset and a guarantee of the success of our work and are undeniably a source of pride for Hungary, his beautiful country.@@@I would also like to commend the excellent work done and the results achieved by Mr. Abdulla Shahid at the seventy-sixth session.@@@I reiterate my gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless commitment to international peace and security and the United Nations ongoing support for my country.@@@Allow me to pay a sincere tribute to Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth realms, a true icon of peace, who, during the seven decades of her reign, maintained excellent relations of friendship and cooperation between the United Kingdom and the countries of the Commonwealth and Africa, in particular with the Central African Republic.@@@The seventy-seventh session of our Assembly, convened under the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, provides us with a solemn opportunity to reflect on the challenges we share, which are causes of serious concern for the future of humankind.@@@More than ever, the questions of security, peace, the environment and health are entering a critical phase.@@@However, the warning signs are being ignored in favour of economic, geopolitical and geostrategic interests.@@@Is it not the role of the United Nations to transform the world, to make it more just and secure, and to ensure the dignity of each and every one of us, regardless of the global context?@@@Indeed, the many hotbeds of tension and crisis in the world challenge our collective conscience and also show us that our Organization is the product of a bygone era.@@@The Central African Republic therefore reiterates its support for the African Union Common Position, which calls for profound reform of the United Nations and an increase in the number of Security Council members to ensure a more just and more representative participation of all continents.@@@The protection of the environment — that is, protecting the place where we live — is one of the interdependent challenges that we must absolutely address.@@@It is time for the biggest polluters to honour their commitments, in particular the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and international solidarity for climate justice for the most vulnerable populations.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has taught us that global health security is essential to all nations without exception.@@@My country welcomes the paradigm shift that is occurring in the health sector and the unprecedented outpouring of solidarity accompanying it, including access to vaccines to protect against polio, COVID-19 and, soon, malaria.@@@It is therefore with pride that my country has achieved the status of a polio-free country and vaccinated 50 per cent of its national target population against COVID-19.@@@I commend and encourage the health and emergency preparedness initiative implemented by the World Health Organization.@@@The Central African Republic is proud to be the instigator and the first pilot country, with tangible benefits for the improvement of its capacity to manage epidemics.@@@The Central African Republic has seen its march towards development slowed in recent years by serious security and health crises, which have been exacerbated by the persistent lack of financial support from the international community, resulting in the disruption of agricultural, forestry and mining production.@@@As a fragile State faced with food insecurity and a glaring shortage of material and human resources, the Central African Republic continues to make enormous sacrifices to improve its macroeconomic management and fiscal governance.@@@With the support of its partners, my country has implemented ambitious reforms to strengthen the mobilization of revenues and optimize public spending.@@@My country is waiting for the re-establishment of the Extended Credit Facility programme, which has been suspended by the International Monetary Fund, to support an increase in domestic resources in order to cope with the lack of budgetary support from technical and financial partners and the digitization of minor revenue.@@@Solutions still need to be explored through regional and international mechanisms, in a spirit of interdependence, to overcome the challenges of physical infrastructure — transport, energy, water, education and health care — through the implementation of adapted programmes and the mobilization of financing through the public-private partnerships; access to capital markets for the financing of development projects through public-private partnerships; the development and coordination of trade policies and economic relations with other regions; support for education system through the training of trainers and the creation of professional training centres; the development of a resilient economy able to withstand internal and external shocks through economic diversification and the adoption of new technologies; the creation of innovative financing mechanisms to address both agriculture and climate change so as to improve access to the financial capital needed to develop the agropastoral sector; and the promotion of smart solutions and approaches to climate change that are adapted to the national context.@@@The Central African Republic was the first country in Africa to adopt Bitcoin as a digital payment reference currency and the first in the world to unanimously adopt a law governing cryptocurrencies.@@@That ambitious and innovative initiative has enormous potential to reposition the economy, improve prospects and change the destiny of Central Africans at a time when we need to be open to new horizons and solutions that go transcend convention.@@@It is an established fact that the Central African Republic is contributing to the search for transformative solutions to address interdependent challenges with greater commitment and conviction.@@@In that respect, several bold reforms and initiatives have been undertaken, with the support of international partners, to strengthen the rule of law and restore the authority of the State throughout the country.@@@Moreover, the courageous measures taken by the Government in the fight against impunity, the implementation of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic of 6 February 2019, the Joint Roadmap for Peace in the Central African Republic, adopted in Luanda, and the recommendations of the republican dialogue have helped to ease sociopolitical tensions in the country.@@@In keeping with its international commitments, the Central African Republic abolished the death penalty on 1 June and adopted, on 31 August, a law on combating trafficking in persons and a child protection code.@@@It is with particular interest that I note the Security Council’s firm condemnation, in its recent resolution 2648 (2022), of 29 July, of the attacks perpetrated against peaceful civilian populations by armed groups.@@@I also note with satisfaction the Council’s position against the transnational trafficking networks that continue to supply armed groups with weapons of all types.@@@In welcoming the significant progress that has made it possible to substantially lift the arms embargo imposed on our defence and security forces, I would like to convey the gratitude of the Central African people to all the friendly and brotherly countries that firmly support our request for the total lifting of the embargo.@@@I deplore, however, the manoeuvring aimed at legitimizing the armed groups and insidiously maintaining the embargo.@@@Who stands to benefit from that crime?@@@The Central African Republic has suffered a great deal from miscalculations and disinformation, which have, unfortunately, gone on for too long.@@@The Central African youth is made up of a pool of high achievers whose only obstacle to developing their country is a lack of peace and security.@@@I would like to denounce the disinformation and spin campaigns aimed at coercively discrediting and destabilizing the democratic institutions of the Central African Republic.@@@Those campaigns, which are being conducted by certain international media outlets on the basis of a thinly-veiled and threatening neocolonialism, are successful not because they are true but because of their tried-and-tested manipulative rhetoric.@@@They are based solely on preserving the geostrategic and geopolitical interests of certain States that have little to do with the vital interests of the Central African people.@@@The Central African Republic calls on its partners to engage in a relationship of trust and mutual respect.@@@We are always ready to cooperate with every country in the world, provided that our vital interests and sovereignty are respected.@@@I wish our work every success.@@@Long live international solidarity.@@@At the outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate His Excellency@@@Mr. Csaba@@@Korosi on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish him every success.@@@I express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his efforts.@@@We also highly value the efforts of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, to enhance the role of the United Nations and achieve its goals.@@@Our world has become a global village.@@@Our issues and concerns are intertwined, and our world is changing at an accelerated pace.@@@The effects of any environmental incident, economic crisis or military confrontation reverberate globally.@@@However, our approaches and methods have not developed at the same pace to keep abreast of those revolutionary changes.@@@Whether one believes that our world is unipolar or multipolar, global policy is still being managed according to the logic of the uneven capacities and different interests and priorities of States, and not according to the logic of one world and one humankind.@@@I mean specifically that global crises are being managed on the basis of narrow and short-term interests, the marginalization of international law and the management of differences according to balances of power rather than the Charter of the United Nations and respect for State sovereignty.@@@We lack mechanisms sufficient to deter and punish those who violate State sovereignty.@@@The international community is unable to impose the settlements of conflicts when the stronger parties reject such settlements.@@@In such circumstances, the behaviour of world leaders and their wisdom and
commitment to justice in dealing with relations among countries are important.@@@We are fully aware of the complexities of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its international dimension.@@@However, we call for a ceasefire and a peaceful settlement because that is what ultimately will happen, regardless of how long this war goes on.@@@Perpetuating the conflict will not change this result.@@@It will only increase the number of casualties and double its disastrous repercussions on Europe, Russia and the global economy.@@@On a different note, I do not think that the representatives of the countries represented here need to be reminded that the Palestinian question remains without solution.@@@Given the failure to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and the continuous change of the situation on the ground, the occupation, with its settlement activities, is pursuing a policy of fait accompli.@@@That may change the rules of the conflict and the format of global solidarity in the future.@@@In this regard, I stress once again that we stand in full solidarity with the brotherly Palestinian people in their aspiration to achieve justice.@@@The Security Council must shoulder its responsibility and compel Israel to end the occupation of Palestinian territories and to establish a Palestinian State within the borders of 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@Moreover, in our region, the international community has not been able to hold war criminals in Syria to account.@@@Even more disappointing is the fact that some are trying to turn the page on the suffering of the Syrian people, ignoring the significant sacrifices made by those blighted people and failing to fulfil their aspirations to the unity, peace and security of Syria.@@@The United Nations should not accept the restriction of the political track to the so-called Constitutional Committee under its auspices.@@@The Syrian crisis has taught us an important lesson about what can happen when the international community lacks a long-term vision for addressing the suffering of peoples from unlimited injustice, destitution and civil wars.@@@Soon enough, accompanying phenomena, such as the refugee issue, become another problem that requires a solution.@@@We highly value the role played by countries that have hosted Syrian refugees.@@@However, we must recall the importance of addressing the root causes of the problems before having to deal with their repercussions on our countries.@@@In Libya, we call for immediate measures to be taken at the international level to continue the political process.@@@We also call for a constitution-based agreement on elections and the unification of State institutions.@@@We all are aware that it is impossible to restore the State without unifying military forces and rehabilitating armed factions into one national army.@@@Any party that rejects this solution must be denounced and held accountable.@@@In Yemen, there is a glimmer of hope as parties have agreed to a temporary truce.@@@We look forward to a comprehensive, lasting ceasefire to pave the way for negotiations among the Yemeni parties, based on the outcomes of the national dialogue and the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, in addition to relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015).@@@We hope that national consensus will be achieved in Iraq, Lebanon and the Sudan.@@@The political elites must be up to the task of ensuring that citizens are able to achieve their aspirations.@@@That would ensure the unity of the people, the unity of the nation and diversity all at the same time.@@@Not only is that possible; it is actually extremely realistic, provided that there is willingness to make concessions to reach settlements and abandon the sectarian, partisan quota approach that has been rejected by the younger generations.@@@We in Qatar believe in the need to achieve a just agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme that takes into account the concerns of all parties and establishes a region free of nuclear weapons.@@@Such a solution should also recognize the right of the Iranian people to benefit from nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.@@@There is no alternative to such an agreement, which would contribute to the stability and security of the region and open the door to further dialogue and the achievement of regional security.@@@In Afghanistan, we call on all parties to maintain and build on the gains of the Doha Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan.@@@That includes ensuring that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for extremist and terrorist groups.@@@Only then will the Afghan people be able to enjoy long-awaited prosperity and stability.@@@We have stressed time and again the importance of protecting civilians in Afghanistan and of respecting human rights, including women’s rights and the right of girls to education.@@@We have also stressed the importance of achieving national reconciliation
among all segments of Afghani society and warned against isolating and besieging Afghanistan, which would be counterproductive.@@@Due to lack of global coordination and the rational and balanced planning of energy policies over many decades, we are now all facing an unprecedented energy crisis.@@@Some 1 billion people around the world are living without a main reliable energy source.@@@While the crisis of the war in Ukraine might be new, a political crisis turning into an energy crisis is not.@@@This situation has been silently deteriorating since before the war in Ukraine.@@@Decades of pressure to stop investing in fossil fuels before securing the environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives that we must develop have led to significant shortages in energy supplies.@@@Undoubtedly, climate change and the protection of the environment in general compel us to diversify energy sources as soon as possible.@@@However, we must continue to supply energy in the meantime.@@@We must be realistic and recognize that the future of energy will include a combination of sustainable energy sources, such as solar energy, hydrogen, wind energy and also hydrocarbons.@@@As Qatar has continued to invest in liquefied natural gas for decades, we are now able to expand our northern gas field.@@@That will play a pivotal role in alleviating the crisis of energy shortages in many important parts of the world.@@@When it comes to basic commodities, such as energy, food and medication, exporters bear a special responsibility that exceeds commercial responsibility.@@@They must be reliable, and they must respect agreements.@@@Banning the transit, export and import of those commodities in times of political crisis and imposing blockades on affected countries is not acceptable.@@@Neither is it acceptable to use those commodities as tools of conflict.@@@They are not weapons.@@@It is equally unacceptable to use water sources as if they were political tools.@@@While the world situation today paints a bleak picture of the future of humankind, we believe in dialogue and joint action.@@@We believe in all parties attempting to understand each other — in putting themselves in one another’s shoes in order to see things from the perspective of others.@@@Medium-sized and small countries are most in need of fixed rules that govern international relations.@@@Relying on major Powers should not be a reason to abandon communication with one another.@@@We all have a role to play.@@@What appears today to be impossible will be a reality if we have the vision, the will and the good intentions.@@@Qatar’s approach focuses on national and human development.@@@Our foreign policy is based on achieving a balance between principles and interests.@@@We have also focused on mediation to settle disputes by using peaceful means.@@@We are aware of our responsibility as a source of energy, and we have proved to be a reliable partner at the international level.@@@Qatar will welcome the world when we host the Football World Cup in November.@@@This challenge, which started 12 years ago, required genuine determination and resolve, considerable planning and hard work.@@@Today we are ready to receive teams and spectators from all over the world.@@@We are opening our doors in Doha to them without discrimination so that they can all enthusiastically enjoy the football championship and witness the economic and cultural development in our country.@@@The Football World Cup is being organized for the first time in a Muslim Arab country and in the Middle East in general.@@@The world will witness that one of the small and medium-sized countries is able to host global events with exceptional success and to create an environment conducive to diversity and constructive interaction among the peoples of the world.@@@This event has already a positive effect in our region.@@@Sisterly Arab nations have welcomed the so- called Hayya Card, which offers a visa to enter Qatar and other Arab countries.@@@The Hayya Card has been welcomed by the public as well and incentivized Arab nations to look forward to a future where there are no barriers among peoples.@@@The Qatari people will open their arms to welcome football fans from all over the world.@@@To quote the Holy Qur’an,
“We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other” (The Holy Qur’an, XLIX.13).@@@Regardless of our different nationalities, religions and ideologies, our duty is to overcome barriers and extend the hand of friendship to build bridges of understanding and value our common humanity.@@@On behalf of my people and myself, I invite everyone here to come to Qatar and to enjoy this unique Football World Cup.@@@I welcome you all.@@@May peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.@@@As we gather for the seventy-seventh opening of the General Assembly, the unique and indispensable convening power of the United Nations is evident for all of us to see.@@@Having listened to addresses and statements from leaders from around the world, it is equally clear that the Charter of the United Nations continues to inspire and fill us with hope for a better world.@@@And, still, our world is in crisis.@@@We are, in the words of the Secretary-General, “gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction” (A/77/PV.4, p. 2).@@@Six months ago, war erupted again in Europe.@@@Unprovoked, Russia attacked Ukraine, a neighbour shared by Russia and Europe.@@@The military aggression is a vicious onslaught on the people of Ukraine.@@@Their resilience and bravery in the face of brutality is awe-inspiring.@@@Throughout the week, we have heard many perspectives on the Russian aggression.@@@We have heard the concerns of fellow Member States geographically remote from the war, worried about being caught in the middle of a new Cold War.@@@And we have heard the despair over the consequences on food supplies and energy prices worldwide.@@@We acknowledge those concerns, but we also feel the need to stress that they are caused by the Russian aggression, not by international sanctions.@@@Importantly, we have heard no one — apart from a few self-interested voices — denying the obvious: that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is a direct violation of the United Nations Charter.@@@Let me therefore be clear: Russia’s invasion of a neighbouring State, President Putin’s blatant imperial ambitions and his horrifying allusions to using nuclear weapons are unprecedented threats against not only Europe, but international peace and security.@@@We are extremely concerned.@@@So, yes, we rally fellow States Members of the United Nations to take a stand for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, just as Denmark has stood up in support of the independence and sovereignty of other nations throughout the history of the United Nations, against apartheid and for decolonization.@@@This is an appeal to all Member States to stand firmly on the side of the United Nations Charter, to fight back against an international disorder where might makes right.@@@We appeal to the rest of the world to see Russia’s aggression for what it is: an attempt to expand its own territory by force, which is completely unacceptable, not just to European neighbours, who rightly worry that we could be next in line if Putin has his way in Ukraine, but also for all who believe in the sanctity of the Charter and the principles of territorial integrity and the political independence of sovereign States.@@@We appeal for the understanding of the General Assembly as a whole: that a war in our backyard, initiated by a permanent member of the Security Council and a nuclear Power, and the resulting influx of millions of Ukrainian refugees to Europe, will obviously exhaust a great deal of our resources and political focus.@@@That will inevitably be the case until the territorial integrity of Ukraine is restored and respected.@@@Nonetheless, we do not neglect other crises and global challenges.@@@We know that our other joint challenges remain and have in many cases been aggravated by Russian acts of aggression.@@@The most pressing crises of our time are all truly global.@@@Climate, pandemic, violent conflict, instability, forced displacement, food insecurity — we feel them everywhere, regardless of where we live, in our everyday lives, as the price of food and energy rises, inequality increases and extreme weather and climate-induced disasters hit.@@@Yet, even as those events affect us all, there is no doubt that they are felt most strongly by the most vulnerable, the most fragile and the poorest among us.@@@Developing countries are — unfairly and unjustly — hit the hardest by the global crises of our time.@@@That was and is clearly the case with the coronavirus disease.@@@The lingering repercussions of the pandemic continue to inflict human and economic wounds on societies in the global South.@@@Collectively, we must do more to address both the problems at hand and the fundamental imbalances of the world we share.@@@And we must do it now, for the sake of both current and future generations.@@@None of us can steer through pandemics or counter the climate crisis alone, and neither should we.@@@In the twenty-first century, it is — or rather, it should be — clear to us all that the future we share depends on solidarity and on our ability to address and overcome the fault lines and divisions that increasingly drive us apart.@@@Solidarity is an investment in prosperity, in security, in peace.@@@Denmark is one of very few countries that lives up to the United Nations official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent, and we have done so for more than 40 years.@@@More than anything, today we need climate solidarity.@@@The industrialized world must acknowledge its responsibility to deliver on the climate crisis.@@@Climate solidarity means climate financing.@@@As Denmark strives to reduce its own footprint, we have made major global commitments on climate adaptation and climate financing.@@@We have massively scaled up Danish grant-based climate financing to at least $500 million a year by 2023.@@@We are dedicating 60 per cent to adaptation in poor and vulnerable countries.@@@And we are strengthening our efforts to mobilize public and private financing from other sources.@@@In total, Denmark aims to contribute at least 1 per cent of the collective target of $100 billion dollars — way above our relative share — and we call on others to follow and to do so urgently.@@@If a small country like Denmark can, the Group of 20 also can.@@@We also need to step up and listen to those affected the most by climate-induced damages.@@@We were proud to be the first contributor to the Santiago Network for Averting, Minimizing and Addressing Loss and Damage at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26), and this week we have followed up with several new initiatives for those hardest hit and the world’s poorest.@@@As we look towards COP 27, Denmark will also be among the founding members of the Systems Observations Financing Facility — an initiative taken by Secretary-General Guterres to ensure that early- warning services reach everyone in the next five years.@@@It is a small step, but it is important, because it will make a difference in the lives of people and societies living on the brink.@@@The United Nations most essential task is to save the world from the scourge of war.@@@That might sound like a lofty ideal, but in essence it is about providing space for difficult conversations, restoring trust and finding spaces for common ground on those issues where we stand far apart.@@@The United Nations needs to deliver on that, but the United Nations is all of us, and the United Nations is only as good as what we as Member States put into it.@@@We all need to put in the work and take responsibility to ensure that the trenches between us do not grow deeper.@@@There is no free ride on multilateralism.@@@We must not neglect to maintain and protect the global common that the United Nations is.@@@Denmark is ready to do its part.@@@Just a few hours ago, Denmark announced that it is running for a seat on the Security Council for the period of 2025 to 2026.@@@If elected to the Security Council, Denmark will do all it can to help ensure that the Council fulfils its vital mandate of maintaining international peace and security.@@@As a small country with a long history of global engagement and international solidarity, Denmark takes pride in being a bridge builder.@@@We know — simply by virtue of our smallness — that if we want to achieve anything, we must work with others.@@@And we must do so on the basis of partnership and dialogue.@@@We pursue cooperation where all voices are heard.@@@We seek honest conversations with partners about the challenges we face.@@@And we work to find ways of confronting them together.@@@That is the spirit of cooperation, and we hope to bring that spirit also to the Security Council.@@@Our candidature is a natural extension of our long-standing and unwavering commitment to multilateralism in general and to the United Nations in particular.@@@We all need a United Nations-system that is fit for the future and able to deliver effectively for today.@@@Denmark is a long-time advocate for United Nations reforms — both at the highest level and in everyday workings of the Organization.@@@We championed the reform of the United Nations development system.@@@We continue to support the implementation of the reforms, both financially and politically.@@@Earlier this week, we launched the Pledge to Predictable Payments initiative.@@@It is a small, yet pragmatic step, paving the way for a United Nations that is better able to act.@@@We urge all delegations to help the United Nations help us all, by recommitting to the goal of making our payment patterns predictable and transparent.@@@Giving the United Nations that predictable and transparent ability is a small act with no cost to us as individual Member States, but it is of significant value to the United Nations ability to serve us.@@@The United Nations, however, also needs more fundamental reform.@@@In particular, it needs a Security Council that better reflects the world of today.@@@During the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly, Denmark co-facilitated the intergovernmental negotiations on
Security Council reform.@@@We will continue to advocate for reform towards a more accountable, representative, transparent and effective Council.@@@That also means that, even as we call on fellow Member States to stand up for the Charter of the United Nations and its universal principles and aspirations, we must not settle for simply defending the status quo.@@@We need to do more.@@@We need to do better.@@@And we need to do it together.@@@The good news is that we know what needs to be done.@@@The Secretary-General has presented us with a sobering analysis of the state of the world in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and presented a clear path forward.@@@Denmark fully supports the Secretary- General’s vision and remains unwavering in its commitment to a revitalized multilateralism with the United Nations at its centre.@@@We look forward to working with fellow Member States in translating that vision into reality.@@@And we will do our part to ensure that we — as a collective — make the most of the upcoming sister summits: the Sustainable Development Goal summit in September 2023 and the Summit of the Future in 2024, because those two agendas — the 2030 Agenda and Our Common Agenda — are mutually reinforcing.@@@The twin agendas and the sister summits provide us not only with a sense of direction, but also with the tools to get there if we work together.@@@Moving forward together on the twin agendas of those summits provides a way out of the current gridlock of global dysfunction, a way for us to live up to the expectations of future generations.@@@And let us not forget that this remains the decade of action, so let us act.@@@The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed, as never before, the true nature of the current unfair and unsustainable international order.@@@Never before has humankind had such tremendous scientific and technical potential and such a remarkable capacity to generate wealth and well-being; yet never before has the world been so unequal and the inequality so great.@@@A total of 828 million people, 10 per cent of the world’s population, suffer from hunger, and nearly 50 million children suffer from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition.@@@Unemployment will affect 207 million people in 2022, 21 million more than in 2019.@@@At the height of the fourth industrial revolution, 773 million human beings cannot read and write.@@@Nearly 6.5 million people died due to the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The vaccines to combat it are inaccessible to 1 billion people in low-income countries.@@@In 2021, transnational pharmaceutical companies earned $84,588 billion.@@@Foreign debt has been paid several times over, but it is still multiplying.@@@Paradoxically, global military spending is soaring and, for the first time, exceeds $2 trillion.@@@Nothing justifies the fact that humankind is still threatened by the existence of almost 13,000 nuclear weapons.@@@We advocate the universality of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@How much more could we do if those resources were spent on promoting health and development?@@@How many deaths from COVID-19 and other causes could have been avoided?@@@How many children would be saved from hunger and preventable or curable diseases?@@@Greenhouse gases reached record levels in 2021, and it will be the same this year.@@@Average sea levels have reached a new high.@@@The past seven years are the warmest ever recorded.@@@We cannot continue to ignore the warnings of an impending climate catastrophe.@@@We have only one Earth, the only home for all of us, rich and poor.@@@We must act without further delay.@@@The philosophy of war and plunder and the unreasonable production and consumption patterns of capitalism, denounced by President Fidel Castro, will lead to a calamity.@@@International relations are on a very dangerous path.@@@The United States offensive aimed at subjugating States by means of threats and economic, military and political-diplomatic coercion in order to subject them to an order based on its capricious rules, together with the expansion of NATO and the development of an aggressive doctrine and fifth- generation unconventional warfare, inevitably results in a climate of tension and conflict, whose consequences are unpredictable.@@@Cuba, a small island developing State, has paid a high price for defending its legitimate right to exist as a sovereign and independent nation.@@@For more than six decades, we have resisted a ruthless and unilateral economic, commercial and financial blockade, which has intensified to unprecedented levels since 2019 and during the pandemic.@@@Thirty years since this Assembly’s first resolution against the blockade (resolution 47/19), the Government of the United States continues to ignore the almost unanimous demand of the international community to cease its illegal and cruel policy against Cuba.@@@It continues its efforts to generate material shortages, scarcity and suffering, to sow discouragement and dissatisfaction and to cause harm to the Cuban people.@@@The United States Government reinforces pressure on Governments, banking institutions and companies all over the world interested in having relations with Cuba and persistently pursues all sources of income and foreign currency inflows to the country in order to bring about economic collapse.@@@As a result, the Cuban economy has experienced extreme pressure, which is manifested in industry, service provision, food and medicine shortages and the deterioration of the level of consumption and general well-being of the population.@@@The human damage caused by such a policy to all Cuban families, which is impossible to quantify, is enormous, cruel and immoral.@@@The blockade is an act of economic warfare in peacetime.@@@The current United States Administration maintains in force the most aggressive means of pressure against our country, adopted by the Government of President Donald Trump.@@@The unjustified inclusion of Cuba on the State Department’s arbitrary and unilateral list of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism continues.@@@That slanderous classification places a stigma on our companies and financial institutions and makes transactions and the possibility of payments and credits extremely difficult.@@@Cuba, which has been a victim of State terrorism, does not, and will never, promote terrorism.@@@On the contrary, we condemn it in all its forms and manifestations.@@@The United States Government opportunistically manipulates highly sensitive issues, such as terrorism, religion, democracy, justice, corruption and human rights.@@@Double standards, inconsistency, selectivity and political manipulation damage the cause of human rights.@@@The previous statement by the Czech Foreign Minister, who does not dare to mention the crime of Cuba’s blockade, is a sad example.@@@We have clearly warned the United States Government that the factors that encourage irregular migration and cause loss of life must be addressed, such as its failure, since 2017, to fulfil its obligation under existing bilateral agreements to grant no less than 20,000 annual visas for immigrants, the existence of the Cuban Adjustment Act, politically motivated preferential treatment, restrictive pressure on regular transit countries and the strengthened economic blockade.@@@Today’s announcement that the processing of immigrant visas will resume at the United States Embassy in Havana is a positive step.@@@Cuba reiterates its willingness to move towards a better understanding with the Government of the United States and develop civilized and even cooperative relations between our two countries on the basis of mutual respect and sovereign equality and without undermining our independence and sovereignty, despite profound differences.@@@We highlight the valuable commitment of and the recent shows of respect by Cubans and Cuban descendants across the world and in this country for the sovereign rights of Cuba, as well as a rejection of the ruthless aggression by the United States, particularly the economic blockade.@@@I am also deeply grateful for the statements made by Heads of State and Government in this general debate, for the historic support of the General Assembly and for the expressions of solidarity towards Cuba by Governments, leaders, political organizations and solidarity, social and popular movements from all over the world.@@@That solidarity and support continue to be essential today.@@@Despite the enormous challenges, the people and the Government of Cuba have not lost their determination to make progress in building a more just, democratic, prosperous and sustainable socialist society.@@@We defeated coronavirus disease with our own vaccine resources and the strength of our public-health and science system.@@@We were able to collaborate modestly by sending, at the worst moment of the pandemic, 58 medical brigades to 42 countries and territories.@@@We worked to restore our country’s economic and social life, support the transformation of our communities and sustain and expand social programmes.@@@We continue to improve the legal system of law and social justice in our socialist State so as to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights by all Cubans and to enrich the system of social justice that multiple generations have enjoyed.@@@On 25 September, after a broad process of participation and popular consultation, a legislative referendum on a new and inclusive family code will take place.@@@It will be an exercise of genuine direct democracy and the effective popular power of the Cuban people.@@@“Unity in diversity” was the goal set by former President Raul Castro.@@@Such unity is possible in the countries of the South and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States — a community that is growing ever stronger, and which has been creating the conditions for our region to advance towards higher forms of integration and cooperation based on the premises of the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace.@@@We appreciate the dignified stance taken by several countries of our region against arbitrary exclusions in forums in the hemisphere.@@@We renew our support for and solidarity with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, its constitutional president, Mr. Nicolas Maduro Moros, and the civil- military unity of its people, in the face of attempts to destabilize and subvert the internal order of that brotherly country.@@@We reject the application of unilateral coercive measures against Venezuela.@@@We denounce the imperialist attempts to destabilize the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua.@@@We reiterate our firm support for the brotherly Nicaraguan people and its president, Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra.@@@We stand in solidarity with our sister nations of the Caribbean and support their legitimate demand for reparations for the harmful effects of colonialism and slavery.@@@They need and deserve to receive fair, special and differentiated treatment.@@@We reaffirm our historic commitment to the self- determination and independence of the people of Puerto Rico.@@@Haiti needs a special contribution from the international community for its reconstruction and development.@@@Humankind owes a debt to that foundational Republic.@@@We support the legitimate claim of President Alberto Fernandez and the people of the Argentine Republic to sovereignty over the Malvinas, the South Sandwich and South Georgia islands and the surrounding maritime areas.@@@We express our full solidarity to the Vice-President of Argentina, Mrs. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who, victim of unjust and unfounded harassment by the courts and the media, recently suffered a vicious assassination attempt.@@@We reiterate our firm commitment to peace in Colombia.@@@The manifest willingness of the current President Gustavo Petro Urrego and of the parties concerned to achieve peace deserves the support of the region and the international community.@@@The necessary resources must be provided to support the African Union’s Agenda 2063, which sets the road map for the development of this sister continent.@@@We advocate the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation imposed on Syria, demand the cessation of external interference and call for full respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@We support a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict, which guarantees the true exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to build their own State within the pre-1967 borders, with its capital in East Jerusalem.@@@We also call for an end to the Israeli occupation of the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories.@@@We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the Saharawi people.@@@We reject the unilateral coercive measures imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@We condemn the imposition of unjust unilateral economic measures against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and external interference in its affairs.@@@We oppose interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus.@@@We reaffirm our rejection of the imposition of unilateral sanctions against the Russian Federation.@@@We condemn the unfounded smear campaigns against the People’s Republic of China and attempts to harm its territorial integrity and sovereignty.@@@We reiterate our unwavering support for the one-China principle.@@@We are committed to a serious, constructive and realistic diplomatic solution to the current war in Ukraine — one that is conducted through peaceful means and in line with international law in a manner that guarantees the security and sovereignty of all.@@@Cuba will continue to raise its voice in rejection of domination and hegemony in the form of unilateral coercive measures, genocidal blockades and the attempt to impose a single culture and model on the rest of the world.@@@We will never cease to champion the independence, sovereignty and free will of the people, without foreign interference or intervention.@@@Because of our glorious past and for the sake of the present and future of new generations of Cubans, under the leadership of the President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, we will be creative in our resistance and will fight tirelessly until we meet our dreams of peace and development, with social equity and justice for Cuba and for the rest of the world.@@@I congratulate the President, as well as his country, Hungary, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his service and leadership during the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly.@@@I have the greatest honour to address the Assembly on behalf of my country, Ethiopia.@@@We are at a historic crossroads in the evolution of our multilateral system.@@@Humankind is facing multiple and complex challenges, ranging from climate change, extreme poverty, conflicts, terrorism and geopolitical tensions.@@@The consequences of those global challenges are of epic proportions and leave adverse sociopolitical impacts across the world.@@@Nevertheless, international
cooperation is not nearly at a level that is commensurate with the gravity of the challenges.@@@Although climate change and the resulting extreme weather conditions occur throughout the globe, the crisis largely affects the minimally resilient and those least responsible for causing the problem.@@@A case in point is our region, the Horn of Africa, which is badly hit by record-level drought in some parts, while sustaining extreme flooding in other parts.@@@Climate disaster and its insufferable impacts are preventable.@@@I therefore make an urgent call to all States gathered here to translate rhetoric into action.@@@We must realize our climate financing commitments in order to build resilience and mitigate the impacts.@@@We should act to meet our emission-reduction targets.@@@That requires focused coordination, non-politicization, the avoidance of securitization and good-faith cooperation among all stakeholders.@@@I must emphasize that Africa is not responsible for the historic emissions that caused the climate crisis; yet we are the ones making the most tangible contribution to mitigate the impacts of climate change.@@@In Ethiopia, our afforestation programme, the Ethiopian Green Legacy Initiative, saw the planting of billions of seedlings and created a strong culture of afforestation.@@@We are also on a path to sustainable energy transformation and green growth.@@@These proactive programmes deserve recognition and tangible support.@@@We have a shared planet and a common destiny.@@@Overcoming our collective challenges requires concerted effort and trusted global leadership.@@@We are gathered in this Hall because our forefathers, learning from the tragic episodes of human history, decided to establish the United Nations as the guardian of peace.@@@However, we have yet to achieve true universality in the main organs of the United Nations.@@@Africa has no permanent seat at the Security Council, and our quest for African solutions to African problems has yet to be given the respect and support it deserves.@@@We believe that these considerations underpin the credibility of the Council on the continent.@@@African problems are sustainably addressed when approached in the true context of the region and when full account is taken of the strategic interests and aspirations of the countries concerned.@@@It is only when we do this and uphold regional solutions that we will be able to start reducing the proliferation and seemingly unending presence of African issues on the Security Council’s agenda.@@@Over the past four years, Ethiopia has made significant progress in its socioeconomic development and democratization.@@@At the same time, these years have brought forth challenges that have tested our survival as a nation.@@@In November 2020, a most heinous and treasonous attack was made against the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, which had endeavoured not only to protect the peace and stability of Ethiopia but also to help keep peace in other countries, on behalf of the United Nations and the African Union (AU).@@@The criminal group that remains hell-bent on destroying the societal foundation of our country colluded with external actors opposed to our development aspirations.@@@The insecurity this group created has been very tragic and costly.@@@Although the Government of Ethiopia earnestly tried to avoid this conflict, our efforts to prevent it from being ignited were regrettably unsuccessful.@@@Thanks to the resolve and determination of Ethiopians, the designs of the adversaries against Ethiopia’s progress have been frustrated.@@@We have also paved a path for peace and recovery, relying on the ability of the peace-loving people of Ethiopia to reconcile, make peace among ourselves and start the process of healing.@@@We therefore call for support for our agenda for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction.@@@We also urge respect and support for the AU-led peace process.@@@Any other approach, including the politicization of human rights and unilateral coercive measures, will not yield a positive outcome.@@@The past year has also been a milestone for my country and, we believe, for the entire Nile River basin.@@@Our project, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, commenced lighting our homes and fulfilling our intergenerational aspirations.@@@All the glory and gratitude go to the people of Ethiopia, who financed this project.@@@The dividend goes far and wide to the entire region.@@@Taking this opportunity to do so, I reiterate Ethiopia’s commitment to equity and cooperation in the use of transboundary rivers to bring about shared prosperity with all riparian countries.@@@We will continue the trilateral negotiation under the auspices of the African Union in good faith so as to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.@@@Over the past three years, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has
encountered serious setbacks.@@@The global coronavirus disease pandemic has tested our health systems.@@@Global trade in goods and services was halted causing great losses in our economies.@@@The response by international financial institutions has been beneath the level required and did not account for the special vulnerability of least developed countries.@@@As the Secretary-General put it, it is necessary to turbocharge the implementation of the SDGs.@@@We call for enhanced focus on and support for national efforts aimed at improving agricultural and manufacturing productivity, increasing investment, facilitating technology transfer, fostering fair trade, redoubling debt cancellation and restructuring, and enhancing international finance for national priority projects.@@@Furthermore, we should enhance efforts to combat illicit financial flows, unlawful extraction of and trade in minerals, and corruption.@@@Africa’s young population and its vast natural resources should be a source of growth and better jobs.@@@Africa can be the showcase for green and sustainable development.@@@It can feed and power itself and the world.@@@However, that requires reform of the global financial architecture to ensure more equitable, speedy and collaborative cooperation, based on the needs and potential of the least developed countries.@@@More importantly, we must actively support Governments that work to create an environment conducive to the prosperity of their countries.@@@In addition, Africa’s effort to chart its destiny must not be complicated by competition among Great Powers.@@@Allow me to conclude by re-emphasizing the need to scale up international cooperation.@@@The gravity of the challenges we face today demands that we come together in search of collective solutions.@@@We need more, not less, multilateralism.@@@We shall continue to uphold our cardinal principles of independence, impartiality, integrity, non-interference, sovereign equality and non-selectivity to maintain a working multilateral system rooted in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We need to reform our global institutions to reflect current realities.@@@We need to make them more representative and responsive to the demands of our times.@@@Only through genuine solidarity and concerted action can we ensure collective security and prosperity.@@@I am grateful for this opportunity to address the General Assembly and wish the President every success in this session.@@@At the very outset, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election to the office of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@Your illustrious career as a diplomat assures us of a successful session.@@@I assure you of my delegation’s full support and cooperation during your tenure of office.@@@I also wish to commend your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his skilled stewardship in discharging his duties during the previous session.@@@To Secretary-General Guterres, I extend my country’s gratitude and support for the tireless efforts in the daunting task of finding lasting solutions to the persistent problems that face our Organization.@@@We particularly commend him for his wide-ranging reform efforts to equip the Organization to provide more effective support to Member States across the spectrum of challenges they face, including stronger partnerships for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We welcome the Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) report, which focuses on the next 25 years and represents his vision of the future of global cooperation through reinvigorated multilateralism, with the United Nations at the centre of our efforts.@@@From the humble beginnings of a fledgling Organization more than seven decades ago to a massive expansion in membership today, the United Nations has undoubtedly stood the test of time.@@@Our Organization has witnessed several changes in the configuration of international relations.@@@Some have been traumatic, while others have been benign.@@@The survival of the United Nations through all those tribulations testifies to its resilience and the enduring validity of its mission.@@@Some of the great strides that the United Nations has made span the peaceful settlement of disputes, restoring calm in many countries through peacekeeping, decolonization, raising awareness of human rights and eradicating diseases.@@@Despite these laudable achievements, numerous challenges remain on the path towards assuring humankind of a bright, prosperous, dignified and secure future.@@@The continuous eruption of armed
conflicts throughout the world, terrorism, climate change, diseases, the lingering effects of the economic and financial crises and many others continue to transcend our borders and have remained in the foreground of international relations and preoccupied the international community.@@@It is in this context that we welcome the theme for our general debate, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@We are living in uncertain times.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic has changed the nature of multilateral engagement, diplomacy, business and basic human interaction.@@@The pandemic has not only hastened the pace and scale of the digital revolution, but has also increased the gap between the haves and the have-nots and further exposed our vulnerability as Africa’s landlocked least developed country.@@@We therefore need to make concerted efforts to protect lives and empower the citizenry across the globe through innovation and digital technologies to achieve sustainable recovery.@@@It is of paramount importance for us as African leaders to be proactive in investing in research and development in readiness for a certain future pandemic.@@@At the same time, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which was already anaemic prior to 2020, has been aggravated by the pandemic.@@@The expectation of the international community was to intensify the Decade of Action to achieve the Goals, but sadly, we find ourselves in a prolonged period of recovery.@@@As we ushered in the new 17 Sustainable Development Goals on 1 January 2016, Member States were optimistic that a better life for all was in sight.@@@However, the 2030 deadline for the achievement of the SDGs is gradually approaching, yet there is still no significant progress in their attainment, due to several factors that have adversely affected implementation.@@@In addition to the pandemic, these include unpredictable global shocks, including wars, climate-related events and a lack of predictable financing.@@@The environment in which we operate is significantly less favourable than it was when we began six years ago.@@@Our room to manoeuvre is much more constrained today.@@@Nevertheless, our quest to pursue a sustainable future must never wane.@@@Unless we can work towards the SDGs in a true spirit of partnership, in which each partner lives up to expectations, the Decade of Action will end as a decade of disappointment.@@@As the Secretary-General stated during the election of the President of the General Assembly in June this year,
“The seventy-seventh session can be a moment of transformation, a time to recalibrate multilateralism and strengthen the foundations of global cooperation” (A/76/PV75, p.3).@@@In that regard, I appeal to all Member States to use the seventy-seventh session to renew their determination to work together for the benefit of humankind and to recommit themselves to the cardinal principle of multilateralism.@@@The role of multilateralism and the United Nations has therefore become ever more important.@@@It is morally imperative that we unite our wills and pool our efforts for the well-being of humankind.@@@Just recently, Lesotho was amongst the 45 countries that presented their voluntary national reviews during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.@@@Among other things, our review highlighted the pressing challenge of climate change, which has a direct bearing on food insecurity and poverty, not only in my country but in Africa as a whole.@@@Climate change destroys our ecosystems, results in land degradation and contributes to the decline of agricultural productivity, which is the mainstay of small economies.@@@In this connection, my delegation calls upon all Member States to use the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held this time on African soil, as an opportune time to address Africa’s challenges on climate change and to support our needs and priorities in the form of affordable and sustainable energy, capacity adaption and mitigation.@@@We disagreed for far too long on the subject of climate change until we were confronted by the glaring and compelling scientific evidence that the link between global warming and human activity is indisputable.@@@Sadly, catastrophes have begun to hit, mostly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable countries.@@@While we appreciate that there are resources aimed at helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, we are concerned that such funds are very difficult to access.@@@The global climate-finance architecture is complex, with variable structures of governance and modalities.@@@Some finance
is channelled through multilateral agencies, sometimes even outside the funding mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and some flows through bilateral development assistance institutions, thereby making coordination difficult.@@@Lesotho calls on the international community and our development partners to simplify the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change.@@@The state of peace and security in the world is gradually getting worse, with recurring conflicts and the eruption of new ones in many parts of the world.@@@The emergence of new extremist groups and terrorist entities has not only compounded the problem but is a stark reminder that we must act collectively to discharge the moral responsibility resting on us to ensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace, development and the sanctity of life.@@@The use of military force alone as a strategy for combating terrorism has never been a panacea for eradicating that menace.@@@Terrorism requires a holistic approach that addresses its root causes.@@@Similarly, we as leaders should not turn a blind eye to the plight of civilians in all conflict areas.@@@The international community should be consistent in dealing with humanitarian crises in different parts of the world.@@@We do not derive any comfort from the simmering trade and political tensions between two of the founding Members of the United Nations, namely, the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China.@@@We must remember that we came together as Members of the United Nations under the premise that we are all peace-loving nations.@@@The Charter of the United Nations enjoins us
“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and ... to employ international machinery for the promotion of economic and social advancement of all peoples”.@@@In this regard, we call upon those two great nations to show their fidelity to the principles underpinning our Organization and resolve their differences amicably.@@@Military power and aggression can never beget peace.@@@In the same vein, the ongoing war in Ukraine and other parts of the world inflicts reputational carnage on our beloved Organization.@@@Whereas the peaceful settlement of disputes lies at the heart of the work of the United Nations, we have, however, not sufficiently utilized tools at our disposal, such as mediation, to solve conflicts between and among Member States.@@@Some take sides and support conflicts in one form or another, while others remain in hibernation.@@@Lesotho therefore wishes to implore the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, to live up to its Charter and be an honest and impartial mediator in conflicts.@@@The resolution of international disputes based on dialogue, justice and the equality of all States must be at the heart of that strategy if it is to succeed.@@@We must shun those who fan the flames of discord among us and, indeed, we must not allow ourselves to entertain any thought that, through divisions, there will be one side that will win.@@@We will all perish and be on the precipice.@@@We are mindful, however, that it will be difficult for the Security Council to effectively discharge its mandate while it remains an epitome of the 1945 architecture of the world, as seen by the victors of the Second World War.@@@The reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, can no longer be delayed.@@@A reformed, transparent and more democratic United Nations, in which Africa is represented along the lines of Ezulwini Consensus, is necessary for preserving international peace and security and for confronting the challenges of development.@@@All Member States need to garner the necessary political will to advance the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform.@@@We note with satisfaction the statement by President Biden, delivered before this House on 21 September (see A/77/PV.6), in which he clearly articulated America’s support for the representation of Africa and other unrepresented regions in the Security Council, particularly in the permanent category.@@@Let us make the seventy-seventh session one for decisive action on this matter.@@@Today we see heightened geopolitical tensions that have led to the re-emergence of protectionist trade policies.@@@The economic war in terms of sanctions has the potential to make global supply chains less efficient, subtracting from long-term growth and adding pressure on prices.@@@This state of affairs flies in the face of the resolve of the representatives who gathered in San Francisco to finalize the Charter of the United Nations more than seven decades ago, and who dreamed of a world of equality and shared prosperity.@@@They renounced a vision of a world of unilaterally imposed economic sanctions and financial blockades against
others, or one in which peoples were denied their right to self-determination or were subjected to occupation.@@@It would therefore be remiss of me not to unequivocally call for the lifting of all economic and political sanctions against Zimbabwe.@@@In like manner, we express solidarity with the tenacious people of Cuba for having endured economic sanctions for so many years.@@@We are confident that the United States of America, under the leadership of President Biden, will revisit its position on the embargo against the Republic of Cuba and expand cooperation with Cuba on areas of mutual interest, including on trade and commerce, for the benefit of the peoples of both countries.@@@This the United States did in 2016, through a Presidential Policy Directive, and it can surely do so again.@@@We also want to express our unwavering solidarity with the People of Western Sahara, who languished under the hegemony of colonialism for far too long.@@@I wish to underline, in particular, General Assembly resolution 40/50, of 2 December 1985, whereby the Assembly reaffirmed the fact that the question of Western Sahara was a question of decolonization that remained to be completed on the basis of the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.@@@Equally, the Security Council, in its resolutions 1920 (2010), 1979 (2011) and 2044 (2012), recognized that the consolidation of the status quo in Western Sahara was unacceptable and called for an intensified pace of meetings and strengthening of contacts between the parties in order to advance the organization of the referendum.@@@We call upon the international community to intensify efforts to bring to an end the question of Western Sahara.@@@In the same vein, we express our unwavering support for the people of Palestine.@@@Since the founding of the United Nations, the question of Palestine has been at the centre of the agenda of our Organization.@@@Yet today, the Palestinian territory remains under foreign occupation and its people endure untold pain and suffering.@@@We call on the United Nations to intensify its efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine.@@@Allow me to conclude my remarks by pointing out that the regime of the Charter of the United Nations has so far done its part in preventing a third world war, thereby fulfilling one of the dreams of the architects of our beloved Organization.@@@The continued success and relevance of the United Nations will depend in large measure on its capacity for self-renewal in readiness to meet modern-day challenges.@@@We, the United Nations, should continue to be the voice of the voiceless and the best hope for all humankind.@@@Now is the time for leaders everywhere to join the race for transformative action that can drive peace, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, human dignity, economic competitiveness and sustainable prosperity for all.@@@Lesotho will continue to be a persistent and resilient part of that initiative.@@@Greetings to all people of the world who value peace and unity between different and equal nations!@@@I wish you all peace!@@@I thank you that we are united in our striving to restore peace and to guarantee peace for any nation that has become a victim of the armed aggression.@@@A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment.@@@The crime was committed against our state borders.@@@The crime was committed against the lives of our people.@@@The crime was committed against the dignity of our women and men.@@@The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations.@@@And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory.@@@Punishment for the murders of thousands of people.@@@Punishment for tortures and humiliations of women and men.@@@Punishment for the catastrophic turbulence that Russia provoked with its illegal war and not only for us, Ukrainians, but for the whole world.@@@For every nation that is represented in this Hall of the UN General Assembly.@@@I am speaking on behalf of the state, which is forced to defend itself, but has the formula for peace.@@@I am speaking to everyone who wants to hear how to achieve peace.@@@I will present a formula that can work not only for us, but for anyone who may find themselves in similar circumstances as we did.@@@It is a formula that punishes crime, protects life, restores security and territorial integrity, guarantees security, and provides determination.@@@There are five preconditions for peace.@@@Dear Mr. President of the General Assembly!@@@Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations!@@@Dear heads of states and governments!@@@Dear journalists!
Nations of the world!@@@Ukraine wants peace.@@@Europe wants peace.@@@The world wants peace.@@@And we have seen who is THE ONLY ONE who wants war.@@@There is only one entity among all UN Member States who would say now, if he could interrupt my speech, that he is happy with this war — with his war.@@@But we will not let this entity prevail over us, even though it is the largest state in the world.@@@Ukraine showed strength on the battlefield, using its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.@@@And no one will reproach us now or in the future with weakness or inability to fight for ourselves, for our independence.@@@We are achieving a result in this fight and we see what the end of this war will be, and what will be the guarantees of a stable peace.@@@The UN Charter proclaims the equality of nations — and we proved that Ukraine is equal among the equals.@@@The UN Charter protects the inviolability of borders — and we confirm our state borderline by expelling the occupiers outside.@@@The UN Charter stipulates the value of human rights, dignity and life, and we also stipulate them — with every Ukrainian city freed from Russian occupation.@@@We did not provoke this war.@@@We held 88 rounds of talks in various formats to prevent this war, just from the beginning of my presidency until February 24 this year.@@@But Russia — instead of stopping the crime of aggression, which it started back in 2014 — turned it into a full-scale invasion.@@@And we have no choice but to defend ourselves.@@@We do it.@@@We push the aggressor beyond the internationally recognized border of the Ukrainian state.@@@And this is the first item of our peace formula.@@@Comprehensive item.@@@Punishment.@@@Punishment for the crime of aggression.@@@Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity.@@@Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognized border is restored.@@@Until the aggression stops.@@@And until the damages and losses for the war are fully compensated.@@@Therefore, sanctions against the aggressor are a part of the peace formula.@@@Blocking the trade and relations with the aggressor is a part of the peace formula.@@@All this is a punishment.@@@So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them — at least until aggression lasts.@@@Reject the right to vote.@@@Deprive delegation rights.@@@Remove the right of veto — if it is a Member of the UN Security Council.@@@In order to punish the aggressor within the institutions.@@@We should not turn a blind eye to propagandists who justify aggression, but apply a full package of personal restrictions against them.@@@That is a punishment for lying.@@@Citizens of the aggressor state should not be allowed to enjoy tourism or shopping in the territory of those who value peace, but should be encouraged through visa restrictions to fight against the aggression of their own state.@@@Punish for abetting the evil.@@@A Special Tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state.@@@This will become signal to all “would-be” aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world.@@@We have prepared precise steps to establish such Tribunal.@@@They will be presented to all states.@@@Ukraine will appeal to the UN General Assembly to support an international compensation mechanism.@@@We count on your support.@@@Russia should pay for this war with its assets.@@@It is also a punishment.@@@This is one of the most terrible punishments for Russian officials, who value money above everything else.@@@The second item of the peace formula is the protection of life.@@@The most concrete item.@@@Now, while the sessions of the General Assembly continue, in the Ukrainian town of Izyum, Kharkiv region, the exhumation is under way ... of bodies from a mass burial, which happened when the territory was controlled by Russian troops.@@@The bodies of women and men, children and adults, civilians and soldiers were found there.@@@445 graves.@@@There is a family that died under the rubble of a house after a Russian airstrike — father, mother, 6- and 8-year-old girls, grandparents.@@@There is a man who was strangled with a rope.@@@There is a woman with broken ribs and wounds on her body.@@@There is a man who was castrated before the murder, and this is not the first case.@@@Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration.@@@What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?@@@The only thing that differs the mass burial in Izyum from what the world saw in Bucha is, in fact, the burial.@@@The Russian army was in Izyum for a longer time, and therefore the bodies of the killed people were buried, and not scattered on the streets.@@@So, how can we allow the Russian army somewhere on Ukrainian soil, knowing that they are committing such mass murders everywhere?@@@We cannot.@@@We must protect life.@@@The world must protect life.@@@Every state suffering the armed aggression needs the opportunity to protect its citizens and liberate its territory.@@@If it requires help with weapons or shells — they should be provided.@@@If you need financial help for this, it should be given.@@@If for this, it is necessary to help with the intelligence data —just do it.@@@But what is not needed, is lies.@@@We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory.@@@We can do it with the force of arms.@@@But we need time.@@@We tried to speed it up.@@@We tried to implement the basic provisions of the UN Charter for Ukraine through negotiations.@@@But Russia is afraid of real negotiations and does not want to fulfill any fair international obligations.@@@It lies to everyone.@@@As it is typical for aggressors, for terrorists.@@@Even now, when Russia talks about negotiations, it only wants to slow down its retreat.@@@Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive.@@@New Buchas, new Izyums ...@@@Or at least it wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilization at home.@@@We cannot agree to a delayed war.@@@Because it will be even hotter than the war now.@@@For us, this is a war for life.@@@That is why we need defense support — weapons, military equipment and shells.@@@Offensive weapons, a long-range one is enough to liberate our land, and defensive systems, above all, air defense.@@@And we need financial support — to keep internal stability and fulfill social obligations to our people.@@@Physical and social protection are two elements of any nation’s life.@@@So, the second item of our peace formula is the protection of life.@@@By all available means — allowed by the UN Charter.@@@The third item of our peace formula is restoring security and territorial integrity.@@@Look at how many elements of global security Russia has undermined with its war — maritime safety, food safety, radiation safety, energy safety and safety from weapons of mass destruction.@@@We are already restoring maritime safety and food security.@@@And I thank Mr. Antonio Guterres for his personal involvement.@@@Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Israel, India, Iran, Yemen, Cyprus, China, Korea, Lebanon, Tiirkiye, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Romania and France have already received Ukrainian agricultural products.@@@And we have to increase the supply by sea.@@@Both under market conditions and within the UN Food Program, for which Ukraine is always a reliable partner.@@@By the way, despite all the difficulties caused by the war, we decided to provide humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and Somalia, so we will send them an additional amount of our wheat.@@@But it is more difficult with other security elements.@@@On the eve of the General Assembly meeting, Russia fired missiles at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant.@@@The explosion hit the station buildings — windows were broken, walls were damaged.@@@The rockets exploded only three hundred meters from the walls of the reactors!@@@And this is after the IAEA’s clear appeal to Russia to stop any hostile activity against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine and, in particular, against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station — the largest one in Europe, which Russia has turned into a target.@@@And that makes all of you a target.@@@Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness.@@@The cost-of-living crisis continues in dozens of countries, it roots in the destabilization of the energy market.@@@It is necessary to remove the main factor of global price turbulence, namely: Russian energy blackmailing.@@@It is necessary to cap the prices at which Russia exports its energy re-sources.@@@It is necessary to make Russian oil and gas —just ordinary goods again.@@@Currently, oil and gas are Russia’s energy weapons.@@@And that is why it manipulates the markets so that electricity, gas, petrol and diesel become the privilege of few instead of being a common good available to all.@@@Limiting prices is safeguarding the world.@@@This is the way to restore energy and price security.@@@But will the world go for it?@@@Or will it be scared?@@@Will it be scared of Russian threats?@@@It is necessary to take only one strong step, after which everything will become clear.@@@The time has come for this.@@@This step will put everything in place.@@@After the Russian missile terror.@@@After the massacres.@@@After Mariupol.@@@After the burning of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka by the Russian military.@@@After blocking the ports.@@@After the strikes of Russian tanks and missiles on nuclear power plants.@@@And after threats to use nuclear weapons, which have become the rule, not the exception, for Russian propagandists ...
We must finally recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.@@@At all levels.@@@In all countries that confess the values of peace and protection of human life.@@@Legally.@@@Politically.@@@If you don’t have a legal mechanism, you can make a political decision — in the parliaments.@@@This is the foundation for restoring global security.@@@If this strong step is taken, doubts will disappear — whether to take other important steps.@@@And what is very sensitive — is the border, the territorial integrity.@@@When one country tries to steal the territory of another state, it puts all world nations under attack.@@@Global security cannot be restored without restoring the territorial integrity of the nation which suffered the armed aggression.@@@So, the third item of the Ukrainian peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity.@@@The fourth item is security guarantees.@@@Every nation has the right to security guarantees.@@@Not only the largest nations.@@@Not only the most fortunate ones.@@@We have proposals to upgrade the security architecture for Ukraine, and for Europe and the world, which will not allow any more aggression against us.@@@We are already presenting them to partners.@@@Proposals for legally binding multilateral and bilateral treaties.@@@These are the conditions for the guarantors to act, and the timeline for their actions to bring results — results on land, at sea and in the air; in diplomacy and politics, in economy and finance, in providing weapons and intelligence.@@@Each of you, who will receive the text of our peace formula will also see the details of what we offer as security guarantees.@@@I do not want to compare our offers with the guarantees of any alliances that exist on the planet now.@@@I want to stress that it is always much better to guarantee the security of a nation, preventively, rather than to stop a war after it has already begun.@@@And the fifth item of the Ukrainian peace formula is determination.@@@Something without which the other four items will not work.@@@This is our determination to fight.@@@This is the determination of the partners to help us, and also themselves.@@@And this is the determination of the world to unite around the one who fights against armed aggression and to call to order the one who threatens all.@@@So, all five items of our formula:
punishment for aggression;
protection of life;
restoration of security and territorial integrity;
security guarantees;
and determination to defend oneself.@@@This is the formula of crime and punishment, which is already well known to Russia.@@@And this is the formula of justice and law and order that Russia has yet to learn.@@@As well as any other potential aggressors.@@@What is not in our formula?@@@Neutrality.@@@Those who speak of neutrality, when human values and peace are under attack, mean something else.@@@They talk about indifference — everyone for themselves.@@@Here’s what they say.@@@They pretend to be interested in each other’s problems.@@@They take care of each other formally.@@@They sympathize only for protocol.@@@And that is why they pretend to protect someone, but in reality, they protect only their vested interests.@@@This is what creates the conditions for war.@@@This is what needs to be corrected in order to create conditions for peace.@@@All you need is determination.@@@There was a lot of talking about reforming the UN.@@@How did it all end?@@@No result.@@@If you look carefully at our peace formula, you will see that its implementation is already becoming a de facto reform of the United Nations.@@@Our formula is universal, and unites the North and the South of the world.@@@It calls for the world’s majority, and encourages to expand the representation of those who remained unheard.@@@This is an imbalance when Africa, Latin America, most of Asia, Central and Eastern Europe comply with the right of veto, that they themselves never had.@@@And this is what Ukraine is talking about.@@@And have you ever heard such words from Russia?@@@But it is a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@For some reason.@@@For what reason, not Japan or Brazil, not Tiirkiye or India, not Germany or Ukraine.@@@The day will come when this will be resolved.@@@As for the talks between Ukraine and Russia.@@@Probably you have happened to hear different words from Russia about the talks — as if they were ready for them.@@@But.@@@They talk about the talks but announce military mobilization.@@@They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories.@@@What is true then?@@@The military mobilization in Russia is true.@@@Sham referendums are also true.@@@Russia wants war.@@@It’s true.@@@But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history.@@@Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state.@@@Russia will be forced to end this war.@@@The war it has started.@@@I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis than the Ukrainian peace formula.@@@The further the Russian terror reaches, the less likely it is that anyone in the world will agree to sit at one table with them.@@@And if my words will be followed by new Russian missiles and acts of terrorism it will only prove the weakness.@@@Russia’s weakness.@@@Its inability to prevail over us, its inability to prevail over the world.@@@It will only prove that 5 items of the Ukrainian peace formula must be implemented as soon as possible.@@@We are ready for peace.@@@But true, honest and fair peace.@@@That’s why the world is on our side.@@@And finally.@@@I want to thank one hundred and one countries that voted for my video address to take place.@@@It was a vote not only about the format.@@@It was the vote about principles.@@@Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria.@@@Seven who are afraid of the video address.@@@Seven who respond to principles with a red button.@@@Only seven.@@@One hundred and one — and seven.@@@Friends!@@@— if this coalition is against our determination, then I congratulate you all.@@@Because this means that peace will prevail over any aggression, and that there is no Obstacle for us to implement the peace formula.@@@I thank you for your attention!@@@Once again, I wish you all peace!@@@In these dawning years of the third decade of the twenty-first century, despite the progress and huge potential for the further upliftment of the world’s civilizations, the human condition is overwhelmingly racked by global turmoil, convulsions, dislocations and the gravest uncertainties about the future.@@@The specifics that have produced, in their aggregation and multiple interconnections, that debilitating malaise and tumult are well known.@@@We identify here and now those of centrality and urgency: irresponsible and dangerous human-made climate change; a dominant economic and trading system, awash with antagonistic contradictions, which has delivered unacceptable burdens to the poor and the weak, on the one hand, and benefits in abundance to the rich and the strong, on the other; unnecessary and unwise conflicts and declared and undeclared wars, which subvert the settled norms and precepts of international law and contribute to economic hardship and immense suffering globally; avoidable public health emergencies, including pandemics, and the distorted, uneven responses thereto; and the dangerous vanities, delusional vainglories and hubris of men and women in power, particularly in the global centres of
imperialism and in the locales of those intoxicated by the quest for hegemony.@@@Across the world the faces of ordinary men and women are strained and anxious.@@@Indeed, there is increasingly a sense of despair.@@@At such junctures, historically civilizations have either descended into barbarism of one sort or another or accepted the necessity to repair and embrace fresh hope, conjoined with love for humankind and an abiding faith, made perfect in works.@@@Surely, this is the time to embrace fresh hope.@@@The existential longing that touches the human spirit and soul goes beyond a mere amelioration of our current travails; it demands correctives or reformations of a structural or fundamental kind and fresh thinking.@@@Without fresh hope, a desecration of our future awaits us.@@@Fresh ideas are a core foundation of fresh hope.@@@Over 130 years ago, the Cuban patriot Jose Marti advised that “weapons of the mind ... vanquish all others”.@@@Through Marti, we learn that
“[A] vital idea set ablaze before the world at the
right moment can, like the mystic banner of the last
judgment, stop a fleet of battleships.”@@@Our tumultuous times demand fresh ideas and an invigoration of those that have stood the test of time in the march of civilizations into modernity and uplifting governance.@@@Unfortunately, stale and outmoded thinking too often shapes, and dominates, the global outlook and conduct of the most powerful nations, to the detriment of peace, security and prosperity for all.@@@For example, at least one mighty State wrongly affirms that it possesses an exceptionalism, grounded in a manifest destiny to rule the world.@@@Another State considers, also wrongly, that its population size, growing wealth and increased military prowess, and a civilization that goes back to near antiquity, justify its quest for global hegemony.@@@Others, not quite behemoths, continue to conjure up ancient glories and historic empires as illusory bases for reconstructing the past, oblivious to the fact that any such presumed future of unalloyed grandeur is actually behind them.@@@Amid all of that competitive jostling for power and vainglory, confusion reigns and the overwhelmingly majority of the world’s population suffers.@@@It is instructive to note that the contemporary circumstances of the global political economy and society have prompted the powerful and some wannabe powerful countries to proclaim the necessity of constructing a new world order, each with its own peculiar agenda.@@@But from the global periphery, which encompasses most of humankind, I ask the relevant and haunting questions.@@@What is “new”?@@@Which world?@@@And who gives the orders?@@@The future of humankind depends on satisfactory answers to those queries.@@@In that maelstrom, the centre cannot hold and things fall apart.@@@Yet we must not metaphorically wring our hands in learned helplessness.@@@The principals are certainly not ignorant of the existing conditions, and there are bundles of credible ideas in our multilateral system for fashioning possible lasting solutions in pursuit of peace, prosperity, sustainable development and security for humankind as a whole.@@@So where do we go from here?@@@Central to a credible, equitable path forward for humankind and to civilized life, living and production is the requisite of quality global leadership.@@@It is a truism that men and women usually make history only to the extent that the circumstances of history and contemporary reality permit it.@@@But it is also true — indeed, necessary and desirable — for global leadership to transcend the existing circumstances that are given and transmitted from the past and to push the boundaries of possibilities, for humankind’s sake, beyond what are normally considered the outer limits.@@@I believe that the world’s peoples are demanding a quality global leadership that not only inspires them but draws out of them their goodness, their elemental yearnings for humanity and their nobility of purpose.@@@Often the people themselves do not even know that they possess such goodness, humanity and nobility.@@@At this very moment of our meeting here in civilization’s finest hours, we are eyewitnesses and earwitnesses to immense conflict, strife and harrowing suffering in the world at large.@@@It is an indictment on our civilized Assembly that horrific wars rumble on unabated in Ukraine, Yemen, Syria, parts of Africa and elsewhere.@@@At least one of those wars could lead to a nuclear Armageddon.@@@And how much longer must we stand the balkanization and systematic oppression of the people of Palestine by those who are in arrogant disregard of world opinion and international law?@@@Why are the illegal and unjust economic embargo, undeclared war and criminal interventions against Cuba permitted to continue without let-up, despite overwhelming, near- unanimous denunciation by the General Assembly?@@@Why do we not unequivocally resist imperialism’s sordid attempts to subvert the duly elected Governments of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the
Republic of Nicaragua?@@@How can we look askance, in relative silence and contented inaction, in disregard of Taiwan’s legitimate right to exist in accordance with the wishes and will of the Taiwanese people?@@@Why do we not encourage peace and security across the Taiwan Strait by, among other things, permitting Taiwan’s participation in the relevant specialized agencies in the United Nations system, such as the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization?@@@All of those and other twentieth-century quarrels and contentious situations have potentially viable solutions — or, at the very least, mutually acceptable levels of dissatisfaction — lodged within a framework of peace and security.@@@Quality global leadership in communion with the world’s peoples, credible ideas for resolution and a coherent multilateralism grounded in international law constitute the only viable way forward for humankind.@@@In short, let us give mature diplomacy a chance to succeed.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has had to face immense challenges since March 2020 and continues to do so.@@@In March 2020, the coronavirus disease pandemic descended on us like the proverbial thief in the night.@@@Although we did not close our country down, even in the darkest days of the pandemic, much of the world locked down on us.@@@Life, living and production were, and still are, badly affected.@@@In April 2021, my small country suffered 32 volcanic eruptions that caused widespread destruction of property, immense social dislocation, the immiseration of our people and the evacuation of one fifth of the population into emergency shelters.@@@In early July 2021, Hurricane Elsa struck, resulting in further loss and damage.@@@In late February 2022, open hostilities between Russia and Ukraine erupted, exacerbating the economic turmoil that was already brewing globally.@@@The knock-on effects of the Russia-Ukraine war have been terrible for faraway Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and our Caribbean.@@@The price of basic commodities, such as imported fuel, food, fertilizer and hand tools, has gone through the roof.@@@Still, we are a resilient people.@@@We are not a people of lamentations.@@@We are recovering and embracing fresh hope.@@@We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are working hard and smart.@@@But without a fair and just global economic order, a special regard for small island exceptionalism, a global architecture of enlightened multilateralism and internationalist solidarity, our herculean national efforts are unlikely to yield the requisite abundant fruit.@@@Trying to go up a fast-moving down-escalator is a challenging exercise.@@@Accordingly, I adopt and adapt the words of the iconic Barbadian writer Edward Kamau Brathwaite from his poem “The Awakening”.@@@“I will rise and stand on my feet; ever so slowly I
will rise and stand on my feet... I am learning, just
let me succeed.”@@@Just let Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Caribbean and other developing countries succeed.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expresses its profound gratitude for the regional, hemispheric and international solidarity accorded it at its time of real peril during and immediately after the series of volcanic eruptions last year.@@@Within 24 hours of the first cataclysmic eruption, my dear friend Secretary-@@@General Antonio Guterres telephoned me and placed the Secretariat and the United Nations specialized agencies at my country’s disposal.@@@The World Food Programme, UNICEF and the United Nations Environment Programme were particularly heroic in their efforts, admirably coordinated by the Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Multi-Country Office.@@@The World Bank was most helpful, as were the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and its affiliate institutions, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and individual nations across the world.@@@The outpouring of regional and international solidarity was impressive and deeply appreciated.@@@However, episodic support must metamorphose into structured, ongoing solidarity if small island developing States (SIDS) are to survive and thrive in this increasingly hostile world in which metaphoric elephants trample with very little regard for the proverbial ants who make up much of humankind and are vital to the well-being of our global civilization’s land- and seascape.@@@The agenda for small island developing States is well known.@@@Some major planks of it are concerted global action on climate change, including sufficient resources for adaptation and mitigation; the availability of optimal financing for development, including the roll-out of a multi-dimensional vulnerability index, a compensation mechanism for loss and damage and a special and meaningful carve-out for SIDS in international trading arrangements; an end to unacceptable weaponizing of the financial system; appropriate reform of the United Nations to reflect the interests of SIDS; and effective implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, particularly where they relate to hunger, poverty and inequality.@@@For our Caribbean, another special concern is the urgent issue of reparations from European States for their commission of native genocide and the enslavement of Africans, which has resulted in painful legacies of underdevelopment.@@@The time has now surely come for the issue to be addressed urgently.@@@Reparations is a just and juridically grounded demand that ought to evoke support from well-meaning people, not confrontation.@@@The continuing deteriorating situation in Haiti demands focused attention from the United Nations.@@@The Caribbean Community, to which Haiti belongs, is pained at Haiti’s circumstances and the international community’s relative neglect of that invaluable nation.@@@Together, we must do better with and for Haiti in concert with the Haitian people, based on their own home-grown solutions and led by them.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has been actively engaged on that issue within both CARICOM and the United Nations.@@@Haiti’s 11 million people deserve better, and a safe and prosperous Haiti means a far more secure and peaceful Caribbean.@@@In the Caribbean, beyond the Haitian issue, our national and regional efforts are stymied by the unfairness and relative unresponsiveness of the global political economy.@@@Often, too, the unintended consequences of the actions of the centres of imperialism and hegemonic forces induce suffering or hold back our progress.@@@For example, our Caribbean has had its correspondent banking arrangements compromised or withdrawn by the application of rules that our Governments have had little or no role in making.@@@We heard the Prime Minister of the Bahamas speak about that this morning.@@@Similarly, blacklists and sanctions are imposed or threatened by faceless bureaucrats in imperial centres for this or that matter without any regard for multilateral rulemaking or settled international law.@@@Meanwhile, interference in the internal affairs of our nations persists through external State agencies or private entities of imperialist or hegemonic centres bent on imposing their will to their advantage.@@@Often their relentless misuse and abuse of modern information technologies, with falsehoods and misrepresentations galore, have the effect of polluting democratic discourse and undermining democracy itself.@@@The United Nations must address that issue urgently.@@@The United Nations, too, must reform itself to do its work better.@@@In that regard, reform of the Security Council should be delayed no further.@@@Many sensible ideas for reform are on the table.@@@Let us get on with it and not make perfection the enemy of the good.@@@The many-sided turmoil of today prompts me to conclude with the probing insights of Guyana’s Poet Laureate Martin Carter, in his celebrated poem “Bitter Wood”.@@@“Here be dragons, and bitter cups made of wood; and the hooves of horses where they should not sound....@@@Here is where I am, in a great geometry, between a raft of ants and the green sight of the freedom of a tree, made of that same bitter wood.”@@@In our final reflections before the General Assembly, let us never forget that our work in this Hall is to improve markedly the lot of all our peoples.@@@To that mighty end, we must construct the best possible partnership between all nations, whatever our differences, to take care of yesterday’s heritage, to accommodate and reasonably address today’s interests and to pursue effectively, in peace and security, tomorrow’s hopes.@@@We meet at a time when the world is going through a period of uncertainty, marked by multiple crises on the security, economic, health and climate fronts.@@@The theme of the general debate of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session — “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” — may seem abstract, even obscure, but it encompasses a concrete, painful reality that calls for the international community to commit firmly to reconsidering its approach in order to urgently respond to the multiple threats weighing on the world.@@@The United Nations was created not only to prevent war but also to resolve economic problems through international cooperation.@@@Paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations tells us to achieve international cooperation for solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character.@@@The prospect of recovery following the coronavirus disease was overshadowed by the conflict in Ukraine, which led to a rapid downturn in the world economy with skyrocketing food and fuel prices and supply- chain disruptions.@@@We share the Secretary-General’s position that despite the deteriorating outlook, we can still have hope if there is a collective response and if we commit to working together again in order to respond to the interconnected challenges we face.@@@We also support the Secretary-General’s proposed plan to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@These efforts should prioritize less developed countries, whose collective population totals 1.1 billion and who continue to face major obstacles exacerbated by the global economic situation.@@@We are particularly alarmed by the potential risks for these countries created by severe difficulties in paying external debt, persistent marginalization by international trade, inadequate access to electricity and, of course, the catastrophic impact of climate change.@@@We are deeply grateful to Qatar for hosting the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.@@@We hope that will be an opportunity for the international community to mobilize in order to help least-developed countries overcome the structural obstacles they are facing.@@@My country, Djibouti, is dealing with the consequences of many external shocks, including the rise in world food prices resulting from the war in Ukraine.@@@While these factors have helped to slow growth, they have not put a stop to our determination to do our utmost to ensure that Djibouti can become a stable, peaceful, clean, prosperous and secure country with a good environment for private initiative.@@@In order to do that, we drew up a 2020-2024 national development plan, Djibouti ICI — I for inclusion, C for connectivity and I for institutions.@@@While we had an opportunity to explain the content of the plan during our voluntary national review in July in New York, here I would like to briefly describe the plan’s three areas of focus.@@@The inclusion focus aims to reorganize and operationalize an inclusive sustainable development model with a role for private initiatives as an essential lever for production and exchange, and to ensure better distribution of the results of growth to our citizens.@@@The connectivity focus aims to position Djibouti as a hub for the regional and continental economy and to ensure better national integration for accelerated urban and rural development, as well as improved socioeconomic services.@@@Through the implementation of the third strategic area of focus, institutions, the national development plan will make it possible to strengthen Djibouti’s human and institutional capacity to expand our achievement of rights and freedoms, democracy, stability and transparent institutions and social cohesion.@@@Under the leadership of President Guelleh, Djibouti is determined to work to fully realize all of these objectives, and of course we are counting on the traditional support of partners and friendly countries.@@@Climate change is an existential threat to humankind.@@@For those who still need convincing, we need only look at the extreme weather events that are happening all over the world.@@@We also urge States to read the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2022, whose findings and predictions should motivate the international community to mobilize massively.@@@We cannot postpone our implementation of our commitments any longer.@@@We cannot passively allow each Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) to note that we have not done enough.@@@We therefore welcome the fact that the Egyptian presidency of COP27, at a pivotal juncture, has made the theme of the upcoming Conference the effective implementation of commitments, particularly regarding support for fair transitions and the mobilization of financial resources and viable investments to respond to climate change.@@@Dj ibouti reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Although we are a low greenhouse-gas emitter, my country is committed to a large-scale environmental policy and the goal of 100 per cent nationally produced energy by 2035.@@@Although it may have escaped the notice of some, including here at the United Nations, Djibouti is also negatively affected by the same climate risks as the other countries of the Horn of Africa, especially drought, drastic reductions in water resources, sea- level rise, flooding and water-resource salinization.@@@We welcome the unprecedented result of the seventh replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, held under the leadership of President Biden.@@@The resources mobilized will be vital to defeating those three epidemics by 2030, and they also strengthen resilience and health systems’ capacities by giving them better ways of tracking and preparing for future threats.@@@We have been followed with interest the discussions on an international treaty on pandemics, which would be a significant step towards finding a more appropriate global response and giving the world the tools for improved preparation.@@@The fact is that the best way to perpetuate a pandemic is by refusing to learn from the failures and the efforts made to fight pandemics in the past.@@@Djibouti was honoured to host a high-level parallel event during the general debate in partnership with the African Union Commission and the Mastercard Foundation on the topic of the new public health order for Africa at the national, regional and international levels.@@@In 2021 the African Union launched a new public health order for Africa that puts the continent’s priorities at its centre and is built on five pillars — strengthening public health institutions; improving the capacity of public health personnel; developing vaccines and diagnostic and therapeutic products; creating respectful and action-oriented partnerships; and increasing national resources.@@@A call to action was adopted at the conclusion of the discussion.@@@Paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter tells us that all members must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.@@@In defence of that vital principle, Djibouti, together with 141 Member States of the United Nations, voted for resolution ES-11/1, condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.@@@We are deeply concerned about the stalemate in the conflict more than seven months after its outbreak.@@@We know that this is not a pretend fight with wooden swords.@@@The conflict has led to immeasurable loss of life and destruction of infrastructure, including hospitals and schools.@@@The intensified war efforts, the risk of a stalemate and threats of the use of nuclear weapons are undermining the prospects for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.@@@We echo the call of the President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Macky Sail, for de-escalation and negotiations.@@@A fair and lasting peace should be a priority for all of us.@@@Even if the path to peace is sometimes difficult and winding, it should remain the priority.@@@We reaffirm our support for the African position demanding improvement in our continent’s representation in international bodies, particularly the Security Council, in a way that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century.@@@Africa participates in good faith in the discussions on Security Council reform and we believe that if we are to leave the current stalemate behind we have to show more openness and flexibility.@@@Our peoples expect tangible results that can dispel the growing feeling that these reforms are a vain effort with no end in sight and whose result would simply echo the old refrain — that the more things change, the more they stay the same.@@@While reaffirming Africa’s position based on the Ezulwini Consensus, Djibouti would like to contribute some suggestions to our collective consideration of the right to the veto.@@@We propose that the Member States request that the International Court of Justice, the primary judicial organ of the United Nations responsible for interpreting the Charter of the United Nations, provide clarification on the following.@@@We would ask it to elucidate whether the right of veto is in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations as contained in the Charter itself, particularly in its Preamble and Articles 1 and 2.@@@The Court might also specify whether such a right, which in reality and in practice is a right to block decisions, accords with the relevant provisions of Articles 24 and 25 of the Charter.@@@Without prejudice to the response that the International Court of Justice, whose power is discretionary, might give, in our view its clarification would be useful.@@@Djibouti is a peace-loving country.@@@We affirm our deep attachment to the peaceful settlement of disputes.@@@That is why we have repeatedly urged our neighbour Eritrea to speed up the normalization of relations between our two countries.@@@Despite our openness and availability, in a letter dated 30 July 2021 addressed to the President of the Security Council, the Secretary- General once again deplored the notable lack of progress on the ongoing issues, which are the border dispute and the fate of 13 Djiboutian prisoners of war.@@@I am taking this opportunity to once again call on Eritrea to finally agree to resolve these pending issues through bilateral dialogue, mediation or binding arbitration.@@@We also urge our neighbours to dismantle the Anda’ali camp, a step that would help to restore a climate of trust between our two countries.@@@With regard to Somalia, we welcome the recent political developments, including the election of a new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and the establishment of a new Government.@@@We hail the President’s determination, as expressed here from this very rostrum (see A/77/PV.8), to fight Al-Shabaab extremists, whose methods and motives he strongly denounced.@@@Djibouti will continue to assist Somalia
alongside the troop-contributing countries of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia in the efforts to stabilize the country.@@@Our commitment to Somalia is complete, unwavering and there for the duration.@@@Turning to Yemen, Djibouti is encouraged by the truce announced in the confrontations following negotiations.@@@We call for intensified talks aimed at reaching a lasting ceasefire.@@@We are also closely following the ongoing efforts to counter the catastrophic ecological, maritime and humanitarian risks posed by the FSO SAFER oil tanker.@@@We remain concerned about Israel’s political behaviour, which is characterized by the obstruction and violation of peace agreements and numerous Security Council resolutions.@@@Djibouti reaffirms its consistent position in support of the establishment of a fully sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in peace side by side with Israel.@@@In conclusion, let us work together to build a stronger, better-equipped Organization that is better able to respond effectively to global challenges.@@@I join others in congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@As Vice-President, Viet Nam has full confidence in his able leadership and guidance and will work with him to steer the work of the Assembly to success.@@@I thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his important contributions to the work of the General Assembly, and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the leadership and innovation he has instilled in the Organization over the past year.@@@We are at a watershed moment in history.@@@Confrontation, conflicts and violations of international law continue to intensify, mirroring great Power competition and unilateralism.@@@Global military expenditure surged to a record high $2.1 trillion, while the international community failed to mobilize $100 billion for climate actions.@@@The nuclear risk has reached its highest point in decades, but that was still not enough for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to achieve any collective commitment to action.@@@The outbreak of armed conflicts and heightened tension, especially between major Powers, have made the international security climate more volatile than at any time since the Cold War.@@@The climate crisis and other non-traditional security risks threaten our very existence.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc on health systems, economies and societies worldwide.@@@Poverty, inequalities, violence and exclusion are denying the rights of millions to the basic necessities of life.@@@With less than a decade to go, the Sustainable Development Goals are even further off track.@@@Facing these multiple crises, developing countries and vulnerable groups, which lack the capacity, resources and resilience to cope with external shocks, are those hardest hit.@@@To reverse this course, we must fundamentally change our ways of thinking and doing things.@@@This entails reshaping a global approach to addressing global issues, enhancing resilience and placing people at the core of all development efforts.@@@And key to such an approach is international solidarity and partnerships at all levels.@@@We know this from our own history.@@@International solidarity has been crucial to the success of Viet Nam’s national liberation and reunification.@@@Multilateralization and diversification of partnerships, meanwhile, have proven indispensable to Viet Nam’s foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development.@@@They have opened the door for Viet Nam to the world and helped bring catalytic resources to propel Viet Nam’s Doi Moi renovation process.@@@They have helped improved the lives tens of millions of Vietnamese and brought prosperity to a formerly war- torn country, now confidently on a path to become a developed, high-income country by 2045.@@@But I believe the experience of Viet Nam is not an exception.@@@There is an abundance of stories about how solidarity and partnerships triumph over mistrust and fragmentation and bring about positive change.@@@As we move forward in the spirit of solidarity and partnership, I wish to underline four key points:@@@First, a confrontational and zero-sum game approach must be eliminated.@@@Imposition, intervention and unilateral acts have no place in the good conduct of international affairs.@@@Major Powers are particularly looked upon to behave responsibly and work for the common good and not their own selfish interests.@@@Viet Nam calls for strengthened multilateralism and international cooperation in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, equality and mutual benefit.@@@Major United Nations and international agendas, especially the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and climate actions, must not be put on hold due to isolated disagreements among countries.@@@We must stay focused on our common goals and responsibilities.@@@We stand in firm solidarity with the people of Cuba and call for the immediate lifting of the unilateral embargoes on Cuba, which are contrary to international law.@@@Secondly, our actions, both individually and collectively, must be guided by and in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Viet Nam firmly believes that respect for international law, especially respect for the sovereign
equality, political independence and territorial integrity of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes, is the most effective and viable measure to prevent conflicts and promote sustainable peace and security.@@@Constructive dialogue and respect for the legitimate rights and interests of all parties, in accordance with international law, are key to resolving differences and reducing tensions.@@@Viet Nam calls for the cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, and stands ready to contribute to the diplomatic process and to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Ukraine.@@@Thirdly, we need strong and effective multilateral institutions, with the United Nations at their heart, to best address global challenges.@@@They are best positioned to initiate and incubate transformative ideas approaches and solutions and to forge partnerships and mobilize resources for the implementation of those initiatives.@@@Viet Nam welcomes the forward-looking proposals in the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) report.@@@We will engage actively in the deliberation of these proposals, and in the preparations of the Summit of the Future and the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.@@@We have high hopes that these summits will provide concrete, meaningful and long-lasting commitment and actions.@@@Fourthly, regional organizations can pioneer and play a prominent role in bolstering multilateral cooperation.@@@In South East Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is doing its part to help address regional and global issues.@@@We are working to build a strong and united ASEAN community and advance the central role of ASEAN in the regional security architecture.@@@Building a broad and extensive network of partnerships, ASEAN has created a premier forum for strategic dialogue, engaging important partners of the region, especially with major Powers.@@@ASEAN is working hard to implement the five-point consensus to help find comprehensive solutions to the situation in Myanmar.@@@Viet Nam underlines the need to maintain peace, stability, maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, and calls on all parties to resolve disputes by peaceful means, in full respect for legal and diplomatic processes.@@@We call on parties to exercise self-restraint, refrain from unilateral activities and attempts to change the status quo, and not to threaten or use force, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Charter and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@This year, Viet Nam celebrates its forty-fifth year as a Member of the United Nations.@@@Since that September day in 1977, the United Nations has been a trusted friend and reliable partner, standing with us in our most difficult times of post-war reconstruction and more recently in the fight against COVID-19, and accompanying us on our path of Doi Moi renovation, improving our people’s lives and advancing the country’s development.@@@Welcoming Viet Nam to the United Nations 45 years ago, the President of the General Assembly at its thirty-second session highlighted Viet Nam’s dedication to the purposes and principles and affirmed that the admission of Viet Nam “marks a further step towards consolidating peace and security in the world” (A/32/PV.1, para.95).@@@Forty-five years on, these statements remain valid.@@@Viet Nam’s history and its vision for the future have always been intimately linked to its aspirations for peace and development.@@@We have consistently supported and pursued a balanced and constructive approach in seeking lasting solutions to global issues.@@@As member of major United Nations bodies, most recently the Security Council, Viet Nam has consistently underlined the importance of upholding the United Nations Charter and ensuring that the United Nations best serves the needs and interests of all Members.@@@Our men and women are proudly serving in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Abyei and the Central African Republic.@@@Viet Nam is sparing no effort to realize our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, an ambitious goal given the level of development and technology capacity of Viet Nam.@@@At the Human Rights Council, Viet Nam has consistently worked to advance mutual understanding and respect and to foster dialogue and cooperation.@@@We lead efforts to promote the rights of vulnerable groups in the context of climate change.@@@And now we are aspiring to a seat at the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025.@@@I hope we can count on the members’ valuable support, just as they can count on us as a reliable, responsible and constructive partner in the promotion and protection of all human rights for all.@@@In unity there is strength; with solidarity and partnership, there is power.@@@Let us all work together in unity, solidarity and a spirit of partnership to surmount the interlocking challenges we all are facing together at this watershed moment, for the sake of sustainable peace and development in the world.@@@First, allow me to express our congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventh-seventh session.@@@I also want to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Shahid on his successful stewardship of the Assembly during his presidency of hope at the seventh-sixth session.@@@The annual session of the General Assembly, held under the fitting theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, takes place at an exceedingly preoccupying time of profound, intertwined and multiple crises of epic proportions.@@@Those calamities have already had an adverse impact on all coordinates of our global village.@@@In the past two and a half years, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has exacted a considerable human toll across the globe.@@@It has also introduced chronic economic difficulties and structural setbacks, through domestic economic downturns and the disruption of international supply chains.@@@While the scourge persists, we are confronted these days with the equally perilous fallout of climate change and global warming, which exacerbates the already precarious situation.@@@Furthermore, cyclical conflicts, which have assumed exceptionally dangerous and almost apocalyptic dimensions with the war in Ukraine, have ratcheted up the impending crisis to unprecedented levels.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic aside, the other interlocking variables and dimensions of the crisis constitute the cumulative consequences and telltale symptoms of a tenuous and highly flawed global governance architecture.@@@They are by-products and manifestations of the systemic failure of the unipolar world order that has prevailed for more than 30 years.@@@In reality, the much-vaunted rules-based international order represents a skewed set of duplicitous, asymmetric and non-consensus-based norms and regulations.@@@The fact is that it was essentially designed to advance and safeguard the privileges of its principal architects to the exclusion of the majority of other nations and peoples.@@@Its rather monolithic and condescending ideological perspective leaves no room or space to historical context, distinct realities and cultures or, above all, to the independent policy choices of other sovereign peoples and nations.@@@Indeed, all other sovereign peoples and nations are expected to fully adhere and kowtow, in their international relations and domestic policies alike, to the gold standards stipulated in the flimsy rules- based international order.@@@In the final analysis, the costly wars of intervention, especially in Africa and the Middle East, in the past 30 years, the heavy-handed meddling in domestic affairs, the imposition of illicit and unilateral sanctions, the distortion and weaponization of human rights — in brief, all those episodes of international and regional instability — emanate from and are the direct derivatives of the faulty global governance architecture.@@@The negative ramifications of this dysfunctional system are not confined to the sovereign nations and peoples of the global South.@@@The extreme and ridiculous inequalities, whereby less than 1 per cent of the population owns 99 per cent of national wealth; unbridled consumerism, which has bred and continues to aggravate climate change; and the atomization of societies that has literally decimated social compassion and community care by fostering exclusive and unnatural individualism are dangerous trends that will ultimately undermine the social fabric and stability of individual countries and our global village at large.@@@My rather extensive views on the flaws of the global governance structure do not stem solely from a general and abstract desire by my Government to seek timely and urgent remedies, as underlined in the theme of the current session of the General Assembly.@@@Eritrea has indeed borne the brunt of this unfair international order through illicit sanctions, the use of surrogate forces to create a situation of permanent conflict and instability, as well as the weaponization of human rights to isolate and ostracize the young nation.@@@As we all agree, the gravity of the interlocking problems with which our global village must grapple is so immense that it warrants urgent and comprehensive remedial action.@@@We are truly living on borrowed time.@@@The prevailing global governance architecture has lost legitimacy and corroded the vital global equilibrium that is crucial for continuity and sustainability.@@@In this respect, it behoves us to rise to the occasion to summon the requisite political will in order to roll back and rectify this dangerous trend.@@@We must recognize that the resources and technological know-how at the disposal of humankind are more than what is required if we set our minds to an inclusive and compassionate world order.@@@In that respect and in our modest view, first, our global village and the United Nations system must devise a new international order that is anchored on consensus, with the full and equal participation of its constituents.@@@Secondly, the sacrosanct principles of the equality of all Member States and respect for the sovereignty and political independence of nations and peoples must be upheld.@@@Thirdly, the equitable representation of all Member States in all decision-making international bodies must be guaranteed through viable and sustainable modalities and mechanisms.@@@Lastly, selective and partial parameters that impede our collective well-being and the fostering of a compassionate social system will require thorough review.@@@I want to begin with the story of Karina, 22-years-old.@@@Eight years ago, Karina — a teenager — was forced to flee Donetsk when Russia invaded eastern Ukraine.@@@In spring this year, the family was once again forced to flee, but this time, Karina — now in her early twenties — did not follow her parents.@@@For the first few days, she stayed in touch by phone, but soon things went quiet.@@@After the Russian barbarians retreated from Bucha, Karina’s horrible fate was revealed.@@@Her body was found, and her stepfather shared with The Kyiv Independent what had happened to her:
“There were cuts and lacerations.@@@There was a piece of flesh torn off from her ribs.@@@Half of her
nails were torn off.@@@Her leg was shot.@@@They tortured
her and most likely raped her.”@@@These are haunting and horrifying words; and sadly, this is only one of thousands of stories that mark that we are living in one of the darkest moments since the birth of the United Nations.@@@Out of the destruction and devastation of the Second World War, the United Nations emerged “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, as the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations begins.@@@Never again war in Europe — that was the mission.@@@Never again were schools to be bombed on the European continent.@@@Never again were hospitals to be hit.@@@Never again were cities to be cut off from food and medicine.@@@Today we are witnessing all of these in Ukraine.@@@The mass graves and torture chambers in Izyum are the latest signs of the utter brutality of this unnecessary and illegal war — all gross violations of everything the United Nations stands for.@@@Faced with this Russian aggression and, indeed, war crimes, the United Nations is challenged to fulfil its calling.@@@Everyone in this Hall, the representatives of every single country, will be asked one day: “What did you do to stop this?@@@What did you do to protect the people of Ukraine?@@@Did you look away, or did you act?”@@@In this conflict, there is no room for neutrality.@@@It was the late Mikhail Gorbachev who said: “The victor is not the one who wins battles in a war, but the one who makes peace.”@@@To win this peace, we must place the principles of the United Nations Charter at the forefront again — the principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty.@@@Indeed, if today the world is less stable and less secure, it is because of the sheer scandal that one of the founding Members of this United Nations has trampled on these principles and unleashed a war that reminds us of Europe’s darkest hours.@@@The statements of the past days and the threat to launch a nuclear war against an independent country have demonstrated Russia’s ruthlessness once again.@@@It is reminiscent of medieval barbarism, much more than of Russian greatness.@@@We should be clear — this war will not go without consequences for those who are waging it.@@@There will never be peace without accountability.@@@That is why Belgium has always supported the International Criminal Court (ICC) and that is why we support the ICC in fully investigating and prosecuting all serious crimes committed in Ukraine.@@@There is no room for impunity — not for the butchers of Bucha and definitely not for the leaders in Moscow who are calling the shots and bear the ultimate responsibility.@@@I specifically want to highlight the importance of the fight against sexual violence, one of the most destructive weapons of war, punishable under international law.@@@Women who are exposed to acts of sexual violence suffer irreparable damage.@@@And let us not forget that boys and men, too, are victims.@@@They all deserve truth, justice and reparation.@@@This war is not just about Ukraine.@@@It sows instability, famine and poverty all over the world.@@@We have all seen the images of blocked Ukrainian ports, bombed grain silos and even looted Ukrainian grain.@@@Those images speak for themselves of a chaos sown by Russia, and by Russia alone, that endangers the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America — as if the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic were not enough.@@@In the midst of this chaos, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed in July in Istanbul, appeared as a beacon of hope.@@@It showed the convening power of the United Nations, and I want to especially thank its Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tiirkiye for making that agreement possible.@@@I would also like to commend the positive role played by the African Union, whose leadership and mediation were decisive in the conclusion of the agreement.@@@We European countries have spared no effort in addressing this food crisis.@@@We have maintained food exports.@@@We are helping Ukraine through solidarity corridors, and we are providing emergency aid to the most vulnerable in the most affected regions.@@@Belgium has considerably increased its humanitarian budget in recent years and will continue to work hand in hand with its humanitarian partners to meet the most urgent needs.@@@Yes, this food crisis forces us to look into the structural weaknesses of our agri-food systems.@@@If we are to keep our promise and achieve zero hunger by 203 0 — our second Sustainable Development Goal — we must design sustainable and resilient food systems, systems that combine the traditional knowledge of local farmers with the scientific knowledge produced by research, and innovation.@@@Along with this food crisis, the Russian war is also causing a deep energy crisis with global fallout.@@@People, also in Belgium, have difficulty paying their bills, small businesses are forced to pause because of spiking energy prices, and workers are losing their jobs.@@@How should we deal with this?@@@First, we must continue to support our families and businesses.@@@That is why the Belgian Government is releasing unprecedented support plans.@@@After all we have done to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, once again we stand ready to protect our people.@@@We are not leaving anyone behind.@@@But that is only part of the answer.@@@We should also be honest.@@@We live in wartime and Governments by themselves will not be able to absorb the full weight of this war.@@@I know that this is a tough message, but it is the only honest one.@@@We will have to bear the weight of this war together, in solidarity.@@@Equally important is the action we take.@@@We need to disconnect from unreliable energy suppliers.@@@We must strengthen our energy independence, diversify energy supplies and transition faster to locally produced green and fossil-free energy.@@@And that is what we are doing.@@@Belgium is one of the world leaders in offshore capacity and, with other European partners, we are investing to transform the North Sea into Europe’s biggest green power plant, quadrupling wind power in the North Sea.@@@We are building a hydrogen hub in the heart of Europe for the import and transit of green hydrogen, and we are reaching out to partners in Africa and the Middle East to team up.@@@Energy transition is a common challenge that needs common answers, from the North and the South.@@@And we keep investing in nuclear energy, safer than today with less waste than today.@@@If we want to bolster our energy independence and deliver on the promises of a green and sustainable world, we will need all of these.@@@Belgium brings innovative solutions and expertise to the table with universities and research centres that are world leading and that will help us to change and to adapt.@@@It is this spirit, this can-do mentality, that we will take to twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Last year in this Hall, I spoke about the deadly floods in my country (see A/76/PV.13).@@@This year, along with many other countries, Belgium again suffered the effects of climate change and global warming, with persistent drought that endangered drinking water and destroyed crops.@@@War in Europe should not make us look away from the big challenges of our time — first and foremost, climate change.@@@We cannot let one autocrat’s warmongering distract us from our common agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals — an agenda that has not become less relevant, but quite the opposite.@@@Our generation faces a gigantic task, but I remain confident that with we will succeed.@@@To destroy progress, you only need one man.@@@That is what we have learned this year.@@@But to achieve progress, you need many hands.@@@Never before, has cooperation — international cooperation — been so important.@@@Regardless of all the obstacles, of all the pain and struggle, we have today perhaps the greatest opportunity humankind has ever had to create an inclusive community in which every citizen has a say and a stake — in which progress is attainable for all.@@@Let us embrace this opportunity instead of destroying it with bombs and hatred.@@@This brings me to my final point, a fight close to my heart — the fight for human rights and liberal democracy.@@@On the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we see human rights under increasing pressure.@@@It is for that very reason that Belgium is running for a seat in the Human Rights Council for 2023-2025.@@@Our candidacy reflects our commitment to multilateralism and our support for the international order based on the rule of law and on respect for human rights, without distinction.@@@A stronger focus on human rights is urgently needed.@@@Let us take for example, women’s rights.@@@After years of steady progress, we are fighting an uphill battle again.@@@I am sickened to see the fate of women and girls in Afghanistan.@@@What we all feared has become true.@@@Despite all the promises, Afghan women and girls have been systematically excluded from public life over the past year.@@@Girls are no longer allowed to go to school.@@@They are forced to get married at an age when children should still be playing with their friends.@@@Their mothers no longer allowed to go to work.@@@But as one young Afghan woman wrote, “I am heartbroken, but hopeful”.@@@When this woman, whose rights are being crushed, does not give up then we too
must keep fighting, for going to school is not a privilege; it is a right of each and every child, of boys and girls.@@@The Transforming Education Summit was a clear reminder that we must continue to fight for accessibility and quality of education for all, just as we must keep fighting for the right of women to equally participate in all domains of decision-making and public life.@@@There will never be sustainable stability, let alone peace, when women are forced to take the back seat.@@@Not only human rights are under pressure; democracy itself is targeted.@@@The Russian bombs and missiles directed towards the people of Ukraine are also aimed at causing conflicts in other countries.@@@Just recently, it was exposed that Russia has spent $300 million to influence foreign officials; to replace their free will with Russia’s will; their own interests with Russia’s interests.@@@This is a new form of colonization.@@@In Africa, for example, ever more countries are becoming targets and victims, such as in the Sahel or in Central Africa.@@@I want to make it clear to our partners that we will remain on their side.@@@But is also happening also in Europe, where Putin is financing his puppets to carry out his agenda of division, mistrust and unrest, organizing disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and illegal interference in free elections.@@@It should be clear — we will not back down on democratic principles and individual rights.@@@We will not allow Russian trojan horses to undermine our democracies with disinformation and fear.@@@When the fight for democracy is to be fought, we will and we shall stand up.@@@A founding Member of the United Nations, a permanent member of the Security Council, is waging a hybrid war on the international community.@@@We cannot standby.@@@We cannot look away.@@@We must protect the people of Ukraine.@@@We must do everything we can to help Ukraine win this war, and we will.@@@We will also protect our own people, who are struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills.@@@And we will work hand in hand with the Global South.@@@That is our mission today.@@@For millions of people all over the world, the United Nations remains a beacon of hope, not least for the younger generations.@@@Let us respond to their call and act.@@@People are counting on us.@@@I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election.@@@I also thank and congratulate your predecessor for his strong efforts and accomplishments.@@@I bring the warm greetings of Yokwe from the people and Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands — but I bring them at an uncertain global hour.@@@Geostrategic tensions have risen both in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific.@@@The blue Pacific continent and, in particular, the Micronesian region, are no exception — indeed, we are a unique frontline.@@@As one of the last nations in the world to reopen its borders following the recent coronavirus disease outbreak in our community, we join the international community in mourning our losses, while we are also thankful for its partnership.@@@We value the United Nations as our primary international stage, but if the world does not adequately respond to the island nations, and as the seas rise, then there is really no United Nations at all.@@@For the Marshall Islands, our first and most clear priority as the seas rise is to never cease safeguarding our nation’s land, ocean and maritime boundaries and to ensure that our communities have a safe, secure, fully democratic and sovereign future.@@@The vulnerabilities that we and others in our region share are severe and diverse.@@@We join many others, especially our Pacific Island neighbours, in condemning Russia’s continued aggression and war crimes in Ukraine.@@@We do so not only as a United Nations Member, but also in response to a wider global instability that directly impacts our own island region.@@@Russia and all related actors will be held to account, as actions have consequences.@@@The Republic of the Marshall Islands has proudly been a co-Chair of the Group of Friends of Accountability since its establishment following the aggression against Ukraine and supports the independent investigations of the Human Rights Council and International Criminal Court.@@@The war in Ukraine has set off sharp economic shocks around the world, and as a remote, small island developing State, our energy security is at a saturation point.@@@Even as we seek to boost efficiency and renewables, greater cooperation is needed to move towards regional approaches to energy security and affordability, including by addressing potential joint bulk purchasing.@@@The Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns the recent military actions of the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait, which has threatened to disrupt peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and across the globe.@@@We welcome the International Atomic Energy Agency’s recent monitoring reports on the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and look forward to continued engagement through appropriate forums.@@@While we have shared goals and a strong partnership with the United States of America, we also have grave development challenges and essential needs to be met in order to better ensure the growth and wellbeing of current and future Marshallese generations.@@@We welcome the recent progress made with the United States of America towards a renewed Compact of Free Association, and with it a targeted trust fund.@@@It is vital that the legacy and contemporary challenges of nuclear-impact testing be better addressed, that climate change be addressed with the urgency and commitment it deserves, and that our voice as an equal partner be strengthened.@@@We know that the United States stands tall on behalf of its renewed engagement with the Pacific Islands, and it is essential for all of us to ensure that words be met with actions.@@@The Marshall Islands is gravely concerned about an increasingly polarized world where nuclear- weapons testing and detonation are only growing in risk.@@@We condemn the threats of further nuclear testing and of nuclear warfare.@@@We and a great many other nations also share humanitarian concerns of our own about any nuclear detonation or the risk thereof.@@@And the Marshallese people also have a unique voice in that regard.@@@My country, the Marshall Islands, was ground zero for the testing of 67 nuclear and thermonuclear weapons for twelve years during the United Nations-United States-administered trusteeship era.@@@The exposure of our people and land has created impacts that have lasted and will last for generations.@@@Those impacts to our human rights, land, culture, health and lives are burdens that no other country or nation should ever have to bear.@@@Our own experience, history and current challenges to nuclear exposure are key drivers for urging progress in reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear risk.@@@We welcome effective and meaningful progress on that from major Powers, nuclear-weapon States and all other States in whatever form it can effectively be achieved.@@@As a member of the Pacific Islands family, we rally around and acknowledge the fact that climate change is the greatest challenge and threat.@@@As a low- lying atoll nation whose future is at risk, there could be no stronger statement, nor should climate change be considered in isolation.@@@Tackling complex adaptation measures within a wider fragility makes our task just that much more difficult.@@@Today, as I entered this iconic Hall — a symbol of humankind’s hope and aspiration for world peace, prosperity and international cooperation — my thoughts flashed back 31 years, when the first President
of the Marshall Islands addressed the Assembly (see A/46/PV.7) and called attention to the dangers faced by our small nation owing to the looming threat posed by global warming.@@@More than 30 years ago, in this great Hall and at the Rio Earth Summit, our leaders sounded the alarm and warned of its dire consequences.@@@As a matter of record, Marshallese Presidents and leaders in every succeeding Administration have been active and at the forefront of all United Nations global conferences on climate change and global warming, speaking out and fighting to keep our low-lying nation afloat.@@@Today, we renew our call on the world to declare total war on this century’s greatest challenge — the climate change monster.@@@Yet, after all these years, the world has failed to break our addiction to fossil fuel.@@@We are not investing enough in life-saving adaptation, particularly for small island States.@@@We see the toll of the global crisis.@@@How much worse will it be if we breach 1.5°C?@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been clear — solutions exist that can give us a fighting chance.@@@The twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change delivered vital progress.@@@As the convener of the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, we believe without question that the Glasgow Climate Pact must be the foundation for a safer future.@@@We must honour those commitments and deliver enhanced, nationally determined contributions and policies on coal and fossil-fuel subsidies to reach those targets.@@@We must build that future by catalysing transformations today, by drastically increasing renewable energy and by taking on tough sectors like aviation and shipping.@@@The Marshall Islands has proposed a carbon levy for international shipping that will drive the transition to zero-emission shipping, channelling resources from polluters to the most vulnerable.@@@I humbly urge all countries to embrace it at the International Maritime Organization.@@@I see hope in elaborating a global goal on adaptation that will set our collective sights on a safe, resilient future.@@@Delivering adaptation at scale required calls for bold and substantial investment.@@@The doubling of adaptation funding is a vital start, but, like all climate finance, we must see it delivered to the most vulnerable.@@@Loss and damage to property and human suffering are already occurring, with profound human rights impacts.@@@That must be addressed, including through a finance facility that will help those on the front lines.@@@This is a question of giving hope to those of us that face immeasurable threats to our people, nation and culture.@@@We are pleased to note and support the establishment of the human right to a clean environment and the post of Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change.@@@As a small island developing State, the Marshall Islands is committed to better understanding and addressing complex challenges in human rights around the world, but development is never a trade-off for affirming universal human rights.@@@Our own national experience teaches us that politics must never ignore the voices of the most vulnerable.@@@We welcome the recent release by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of its long-delayed report on the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region of the People’s Republic of China.@@@We are gravely concerned about the report’s findings that serious human rights violations have been committed and that widespread arbitrary detention may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.@@@The international community cannot bear silent witness and must react.@@@The Republic of the Marshall Islands also affirms the role of the Pacific Islands Forum in addressing human rights issues in West Papua, including the prior call for engagement with the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner.@@@As an ocean and island nation, the Marshall Islands congratulates its close neighbour Palau on having successfully hosted the Our Ocean Conference earlier this year.@@@We also supported the recent 2022 United Nations Ocean Conference, held in Lisbon, and congratulate Portugal and Kenya on co-chairing that meeting.@@@The world must address a growing gap in effective oceans management in the high seas and neighbouring coastal States.@@@While we welcome important progress, far greater effort will be needed to conclude an ambitious instrument on biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@While our Pacific islands tuna stocks stand strong, the fishing efforts of global actors grows.@@@We are proud of our sustainability benchmarks and partnerships, and small island developing States must continue to boost economic participation to match their leadership efforts.@@@The United Nations must be truly universal, all- embracing and all-inclusive, and we must guard against leaving any nation or people outside the gate in the cold.@@@Today, we call on the United Nations to better welcome Taiwan and its people into our global family.@@@How long will the United Nations persist in closing
its doors and thereby denying access to the people of Taiwan?@@@Taiwan is a vibrant and responsible democracy and contributing member of our global family, and the United Nations circle of unity will remain incomplete without Taiwan and its people.@@@The Secretariat too often relies on politically motivated interpretations of resolution 2758 (XXVI), when responding to opportunities for the meaningful participation of Taiwan in international bodies and the United Nations system.@@@Now that the world is facing escalated tension in and around our islands region, we as the world cannot be silent.@@@With the ability to engage in meaningful participation in the United Nations system and to make greater contributions, Taiwan can constructively join all of us to make a collective difference.@@@The United Nations system should revert to its original policy of consideration of widely accepted passports for basic public access to the United Nations itself and make good on its goal of broader participation, including registration procedures for civil society access.@@@No one is left behind in the Sustainable Development Goals, least of all one of our important partners in tackling them.@@@The United Nations is in desperate need of a Security Council that is truly fit for purpose and should be better shaped to the realities of today, not those of eight decades ago.@@@We strongly support better progress in achieving Security Council reform outcomes, and in particular support Japan’s bid to become a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@In conclusion, it is very clear to us that none of the problems that our global communities are facing today, from the COVID-19 pandemic to roaring inflation and rising energy costs, can be solved by any single nation.@@@Rather, we must come together as a united global family to solve them.@@@But we cannot solve all those problems as long as the world is in conflict; in other words, we cannot do it without world peace.@@@That reminds me of the following poem:@@@If there is righteousness in the heart,
There will be beauty in the character.@@@If there is beauty in the character,
There will be harmony in the home.@@@If there is harmony in the home,
There will be order in the nation.@@@If there is order in the nation,
There will be peace in the world.@@@We are at a time fraught with challenges.@@@The coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) keeps resurfacing.@@@Global security faces uncertainty.@@@Global economic recovery is fragile and unsteady, and various risks and crises are emerging.@@@The world has entered a new phase of turbulence and transformation.@@@Changes unseen in a century are accelerating.@@@But we are also at a time full of hope.@@@The world continues to move toward multipolarity, economic globalization is deepening and our societies are becoming increasingly digitized and culturally diversified.@@@Countries are becoming ever more interconnected and interdependent.@@@Peace and development remain the underlying trend of our times.@@@Around the world, the people’s call for progress and cooperation is getting louder that ever before.@@@How should we respond to the call of our times and ride the trend of history to build a community with a shared future for humankind?@@@China’s answer is firm and clear.@@@First, we must uphold peace and oppose war.@@@Chinese President Xi Jinping notes that peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when we are benefiting from it, but none of us can live without it.@@@Peace is crucial for our future and it underpins the common security of all countries.@@@Turbulence and war can only open a Pandora’s box, and he who instigates a proxy war can easily get himself burned.@@@Pursuing one’s own absolute security can only undermine global strategic stability.@@@We should remain committed to addressing differences by peaceful means and resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation.@@@Secondly, we must pursue development and eliminate poverty.@@@Development holds the key to resolving difficult issues and delivering a happy life to our people.@@@We should place development at the centre of the international agenda, build international consensus on promoting development, and uphold all countries’ legitimate right to development.@@@We should foster new drivers for global development, forge a global development partnership and see that everyone in every country benefits more from the fruits of development in a more equitable way.@@@Thirdly, we must remain open and oppose exclusion.@@@President Xi Jinping has pointed out that openness is the sure way to realize human prosperity and advancement.@@@Protectionism can only boomerang and decoupling and supply chain disruption will hurt everyone.@@@We should stay true to openness and inclusiveness and tear down fences and barriers that hinder the free flow of the factors of production.@@@We should uphold the multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core, and work to build an open world economy.@@@Fourthly, we must seek cooperation and oppose confrontation.@@@As we face a host of global challenges that crop up one after another, our biggest strength will come from solidarity; our best strategy is to stick together, and the brightest future lies in win-win cooperation.@@@It is only natural that countries have problems and differences among them, but they should increase mutual understanding on a basis of equality and respect.@@@We should engage in dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation, and reject conflict, coercion and zero-sum games.@@@We should jointly oppose group politics and bloc confrontation.@@@Fifthly, we must strengthen solidarity and oppose division.@@@President Xi once stated that countries around the world were like passengers aboard the same ship who shared a common stake.@@@All of us passengers should pull together to navigate the ship through the storm towards a bright future.@@@Our world must embrace diverse civilizations if it is to make continuous advances, and humankind must pursue an inclusive path if it is to achieve modernization.@@@Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of humanity.@@@Differences in system should not be used as an excuse to create division; still less should democracy and human rights be used as tools or weapons to achieve political ends.@@@We should stand against drawing lines on ideological grounds and make united efforts to expand common ground to promote world peace and development.@@@Sixthly, we must uphold equity and oppose bullying.@@@Mutual respect and the equality of countries big and small are primary principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Major international issues should be handled by all countries, and international rules drawn up by all countries together.@@@No country is above others, and no country should wilfully abuse its power to bully other sovereign countries.@@@We should advocate and practice true multilateralism, promote the equality of all countries in terms of rights, rules and opportunities, and build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, equity and justice, and win-win cooperation.@@@China, as a permanent member of the Security Council and the world’s largest developing country,
is committed to solidarity and cooperation with other countries.@@@It will follow the trend of the times and pursue the shared interests of the vast majority of countries.@@@China is a builder of world peace.@@@We have actively promoted international peace and participated in the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation process.@@@China is the top contributor of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the Security Council and the second largest funding contributor to both the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations.@@@China is the only country in the world that pledges to keep to a path of peaceful development in its Constitution.@@@It is the only one among the five nuclear-weapon States that is committed to no first use of nuclear weapons.@@@It has thereby made an important contribution to global strategic stability.@@@In response to various security challenges facing the world, President Xi proposed the Global Security Initiative.@@@He called on the international community to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, to abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to take the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, and to maintain security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, thus contributing China’s wisdom to reducing the peace deficit facing humankind and providing China’s input to meeting global security challenges.@@@China has been a contributor to global development.@@@We have endeavoured to build a system of high-standard opening-up and to safeguard the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.@@@China is a major trading partner of over 130 countries and regions.@@@Contributing about 30 per cent of annual global growth, China is the biggest engine driving the global economy.@@@China is a pacesetter in implementing the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@It has met the poverty-reduction goal 10 years ahead of schedule and accounts for over 70 per cent of the gains in global poverty reduction.@@@China is also an active participant in global governance and South-South cooperation.@@@It took the initiative to set up the China- United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund and the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund.@@@It has provided development aid to more than 160 countries in need and extended more debt-service payments owed by developing countries than any other State member of the Group of 20.@@@At the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly, President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative.@@@Putting people front and centre, the Initiative is a rallying call to refocus global attention on development and build a global community of development.@@@At the recent High-level Dialogue on Global Development, President Xi announced dozens of major concrete steps to implement the Initiative, generating a strong impetus for accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@On the margins of this session of the General Assembly, China has hosted a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, renewing the consensus on pursuing the Initiative.@@@As China forges ahead, its fast train of development will continue to drive global growth and deliver more benefits to the people of all countries.@@@China has been a defender of the international order.@@@We are committed to upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law.@@@China has been involved in multilateral affairs in all fields.@@@It is a member of almost all universal intergovernmental organizations and a party to over 600 international conventions.@@@It has concluded more than 27,000 bilateral treaties and fulfilled its international obligations in good faith.@@@China abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has made relentless efforts to protect and strengthen its human rights.@@@China is firmly against attempts to politicize human rights and has worked to advance the healthy development of international human rights cooperation.@@@As a member of the developing world, China will forever stand with other developing countries.@@@We are heartened to see the rapid progress achieved by the developing world in recent years, and we will continue to speak up for other developing countries, help them overcome difficulties and fully support efforts to raising the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs.@@@Developing countries are no longer the silent majority in international and multilateral processes.@@@With stronger solidarity, China and other developing countries have spoken out for justice and become a pillar of promoting development cooperation and safeguarding equity and justice.@@@China has been a provider of public goods.@@@In the face of COVID-19, China has made all-out efforts to advance and engage in global cooperation against the virus.@@@We have done our best to provide anti-COVID-19 supplies and shared our practices in COVID-19 response.@@@China was among the first to promise to make COVID-19 vaccines a global public good and to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines.@@@China has provided over 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.@@@In response to tough challenges confronting global development, President Xi has proposed to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, an initiative that has been widely endorsed by the international community.@@@China has signed cooperation documents with 149 countries and 32 international organizations.@@@We have set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, thereby building the largest, broadest and most inclusive platforms for international cooperation.@@@In response to the shared concerns of various countries about data security, we have launched the Global Initiative on Data Security as a reference for formulating rules on global data security.@@@In response to climate change, China is committed to pursuing a development path of green and low-carbon growth that puts ecological conservation first.@@@We announced the ambitious carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and are working to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@China accounts for one-fourth of all the trees planted globally.@@@We are making unremitting efforts to foster a community of life for man and nature.@@@In response to global food security challenges, China has put forth a cooperation initiative on global food security.@@@This year, we have provided over 15,000 tons of emergency humanitarian food assistance to other developing countries in need.@@@China has been a mediator of hotspot issues.@@@As a responsible major country, China has explored workable Chinese approaches to solving hotspot issues.@@@While adhering to the principle of non-interference in others’ domestic affairs and respecting the will and needs of the countries concerned, China has endeavoured to help settle hotspot issues in a constructive way.@@@Our approach is to promote peace through talks that are fair and pragmatic and that seek to address both the symptoms and root causes of hotspot issues.@@@China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis.@@@The pressing priority is to restore peace through talks.@@@To achieve a fundamental solution, it is important to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties concerned and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.@@@We call on all parties concerned to keep the crisis from spilling over and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.@@@The Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East issue.@@@Justice is already late in coming, but it must not be absent.@@@The two-State solution is crucial to upholding fairness and justice.@@@China will continue to support the Palestinian people as they pursue their just cause of restoring legitimate national rights.@@@To resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, it is important to address its root cause.@@@We need to follow the dual-track approach and the principle of taking phased and synchronized steps, jointly uphold peace and stability on the peninsula, and resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.@@@Afghanistan is in a critical transition from chaos to order.@@@The right way forward is to put in place an inclusive political framework and adopt moderate policies.@@@The goal should be to resume economic growth and improve people’s lives.@@@To achieve that goal, Afghanistan should combat terrorism and integrate itself into the region.@@@A small number of countries have arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, cut off development aid and frozen the lawful assets of other countries.@@@This is an unacceptable practice that must be corrected.@@@China firmly supports the Cuban people in their just struggle to defend their sovereignty and oppose external interference and blockade.@@@The abuse of guns is becoming an increasingly serious problem across the world.@@@In that regard, I want to announce that China has decided to launch its domestic procedure to ratify the Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, a step that will contribute to strengthening global cooperation on gun control and closing the security deficit.@@@Since ancient times, Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China’s territory.@@@China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity have never been severed and the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China has never changed.@@@All of us Chinese have never ceased in our efforts to realize reunification.@@@It is explicitly stated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, issued some 70 years ago, that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, including Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China.@@@That constitutes an important part of the post-war international order.@@@Fifty-one years ago in this Hall, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI) by an overwhelming majority, restoring the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations and to expel the representatives of the Taiwan authorities from the place they had unlawfully occupied.@@@The so-called dual representation proposal put forward by the United States and a few other countries to keep Taiwan’s seat in the United Nations became a piece of waste paper.@@@Resolution 2758 (XXVI) resolved once and for all, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the United Nations and international institutions.@@@It completely blocked any attempt by anyone or any country to create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.@@@The one-China principle has become a basic norm in international relations and a general consensus in the international community.@@@When entering into diplomatic relations with China, 181 countries all recognized and accepted that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China.@@@By firmly upholding the one-China principle, China is not only maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also truly safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and non-interference in others’ affairs, a basic norm of international relations that is of vital importance to the large number of developing countries.@@@China will continue to endeavour to achieve peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and greatest efforts.@@@To that end, we must combat Taiwan independence separatist activities with the firmest resolve and take the most forceful steps to repel interference by external groups.@@@Only by resolutely forestalling separatist activities in accordance with the law can we forge a true foundation for peaceful reunification.@@@Only when China is completely reunified can there be enduring peace across the Taiwan Strait.@@@Any scheme to interfere in China’s internal affairs is bound to meet the strong opposition of all Chinese, and any move to obstruct China’s cause of reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history.@@@The international community closely follows China’s development.@@@Since the eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened 10 years ago, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era.@@@In the past decade, China has registered historic achievements and transformation in pursuing economic and social development.@@@In this decade, it has also realized a historic leap in its relations with the world and made historic contributions to the international community.@@@China is fully implementing a new development philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, and is pursuing high- quality development and fostering a new development paradigm.@@@With the strong leadership of the CPC, the concerted efforts of our 1.4 billion people, the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a solid foundation underpinning sustained rapid development, and strong confidence in achieving development through its own efforts, China will enjoy sustained and sound development, usher in even brighter prospects and make more splendid miracles come true.@@@With one-fifth of the global population, China’s march towards modernization has important, far- reaching significance for the world.@@@The path that China pursues is one of peace and development, not one of plunder and colonialism; it is a path of win-win cooperation, not one of zero-sum game; and it is one of harmony between man and nature, not one of destructive exploitation of resources.@@@We will continue to contribute our input to meeting the challenges facing human development, and make our contribution to creating a new form of human advancement.@@@Next month, the CPC will convene its twentieth National Congress in Beijing.@@@The Congress will, in response to the expectation of all the Chinese people, set well-conceived goals and tasks for China’s development over the next five years and beyond, and draw up an overarching plan for China’s future development.@@@Having reached a new historical starting point, China will follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve its national rejuvenation.@@@China will work with other countries to make every effort for peace and development, shoulder the responsibility for solidarity
and progress, build a community with a shared future for humankind, and embrace an even better world.@@@It is a great honour for me to be here today.@@@The General Assembly is the place where the world opens up to dialogue and discussion, which are essential elements for peaceful coexistence among countries.@@@As stated in the second preambular paragraph of the 1945 Charter of the United Nations, the objective of the United Nations is “to maintain international peace and security [and] promote the economic and social progress of all peoples”.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing food, energy and economic crises are putting our collective ideals at risk in a way that has rarely happened since the end of the Cold War.@@@Those crises stand alongside the other great challenges of our time — climate change, the coronavirus disease pandemic and inequality — and amplify their costs, especially for the most vulnerable.@@@Accountability for the conflict is clear and one-sided.@@@It is our collective responsibility to find answers to those problems with urgency, determination and effectiveness.@@@We cannot let ourselves be divided into North and South.@@@We must act together and rediscover the value of multilateralism that is celebrated here in this Hall.@@@The invasion of Ukraine violates the values and rules on which international security and civil coexistence among countries have rested for decades.@@@We thought that we would no longer have to witness wars of aggression in Europe.@@@Imperial ambitions, militarism and systematic violations of civil and human rights seemed to belong to the past century.@@@Since February, however, we have witnessed the bombing of theatres, schools and hospitals.@@@We have seen terrible attacks and violence against civilians, even children.@@@We have witnessed an attempt to subjugate a free and sovereign democracy, which has fought back with pride and courage to defend its independence and its dignity.@@@Helping Ukraine to protect itself was not only the right choice to make; it was the only choice consistent with the ideals of justice and fraternity that underpin the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions adopted by the Assembly since the beginning of the conflict.@@@Italy acted without delay alongside the other States members of the European Union (EU), its NATO and Group of Seven allies and all partners that, like us, believe in a rules-based international system and multilateralism.@@@Together, we have responded to President Zelenskyy’s request for aid because a military invasion planned months in advance and carried out on multiple fronts cannot be stopped with words alone.@@@We have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia to weaken its military apparatus and to convince President Putin to take a seat at the negotiating table.@@@We have welcomed thousands of refugees and assisted those who remain in Ukraine.@@@We also stand ready to fund the country’s reconstruction.@@@The horrors of war are best answered with the warmth of solidarity.@@@Moscow’s plan was to conquer Kyiv in a few weeks.@@@Ukrainian soldiers thwarted that attempt and forced Russia into a longer and more difficult conflict, thanks also, in part, to our military assistance.@@@In the past few weeks, a heroic counteroffensive has allowed Ukraine to recover thousands of square kilometres of territory, starting with Kharkiv, and forced the Russian army to retreat.@@@The outcome of the conflict remains unpredictable, but Kyiv appears to have gained an important strategic advantage.@@@The sanctions we imposed on Moscow have had a disruptive effect on Russia’s war machine and on its economy.@@@Russia is struggling to make the armaments it needs on its own, as it is finding it difficult to buy the materials required to produce them.@@@The International Monetary Fund expects the Russian economy to contract both this year and the next by approximately 10 per cent in total, compared to the 5 per cent growth estimated before the war.@@@The impact of those measures is likely to grow over time, partly because some will take effect only in the coming months.@@@With a weaker economy, it will be more difficult for Russia to respond effectively to the defeats that are piling up on the battlefield.@@@The unity of the European Union and its allies has been instrumental in providing Ukraine with the support it needs and in imposing harsh costs on Russia.@@@Moscow immediately tried to divide our countries by using gas as a means of blackmail.@@@Italy reacted promptly, diversifying its gas suppliers and accelerating the production of renewable energy.@@@To date, we have halved our dependence on Russian gas and expect to become completely independent in 2024.@@@On that path, we benefited from agreements made with many African countries, from Algeria to Angola to the Republic of the Congo.@@@We want to develop green technologies together in order to place Africa squarely at the centre of the green transition.@@@The war in Ukraine has redrawn energy geography and, with it, geopolitics.@@@The European Union is set to look increasingly to the South and Italy can be a bridge to the southern shore of the Mediterranean and to the entire African continent.@@@Social cohesion is essential to maintaining a united, resolute position consistent with our values.@@@The rising cost of energy is undermining economic recovery, limiting the purchasing power of households and damaging the productive capacity of businesses, and it could sap our country’s commitment to Ukraine.@@@In Italy, we have spent approximately 3.5 per cent of our gross domestic product to help businesses and citizens cope with rising inflation.@@@We now need to do more, especially at the European level.@@@As Italy has long argued, the European Union must impose a price cap on gas imports, which will also help us further reduce our payments to Russia.@@@The EU must support its member States while they support Kyiv and use the strength of its institutions to shield its neighbours from Russian claims.@@@In many countries, the war of aggression in Ukraine has awakened or strengthened the desire for a united Europe.@@@The Italian Government has long championed Ukraine’s bid for EU membership and strongly supports the integration of the Western Balkans, Moldova and Georgia into the European Union.@@@We can emerge from crises only by looking to the future with courage and ambition.@@@Our goal is peace, and that peace must be deemed acceptable to Ukraine if it is to be lasting and sustainable.@@@So far, Russia has not shown that it wants an end to the conflict.@@@The referendums for independence in the Donbas constitute a further violation of international law that we firmly condemn.@@@Nonetheless, Italy wishes to be at the forefront of efforts to try and reach an agreement as soon as that becomes possible.@@@We have managed to do so in the past, when we highlighted how the blockade of Black Sea ports posed a threat to global food security.@@@The agreement on Ukrainian grain exports marked an important moment of cooperation between the parties, for which I want to thank the United Nations, Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye.@@@It is our hope that we will be able to find other ways of cooperating, starting with the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.@@@Allowing a team of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency access to the plants was a step forward.@@@Now, it is essential that we arrive at some form of demilitarization of the area.@@@We cannot risk a nuclear catastrophe.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has produced consequences that go far beyond Europe’s borders.@@@Rising energy prices have hit the poorest the hardest, exacerbating poverty and inequality.@@@Rising food prices and the scarce availability of grain and other cereals have had the hardest impact on the poorest countries.@@@Reduced gas supplies have forced some countries to reopen coal-fired power plants or postpone their closure, albeit for a period strictly related to the emergency.@@@We must respond to such an attack on our peaceful coexistence with multilateralism, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility.@@@We must respond to the war of aggression by reaffirming the principles underpinning the General Assembly, namely, respect for human rights, international cooperation and non-belligerence.@@@In his address to the General Assembly in 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev noted how, in a globalized world, the use or threat of force could no longer and must no longer be an instrument of foreign policy (see A/43/ PV.72).@@@Efforts to solve global problems, Gorbachev said, require a new scope and quality of interaction of States.@@@Our reaction to the war in Ukraine serves to reaffirm the fact that gratuitous violence should have no place in the twenty-first century.@@@Italy hopes that there can be a future in which Russia returns to the principles to which it chose to subscribe in 1945.@@@A world divided into blocs and characterized by rigid ideological demarcations and military confrontations cannot generate development or solve problems.@@@We must maintain our individual identities while conducting international relations responsibly, legally and peacefully.@@@That principle must apply to all the crises we face, from Ukraine to the recent clashes in the Caucasus; from the instability in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America to the tensions in the Indo-Pacific.@@@Despite the divisions of recent months, we have a solid foundation on which to build.@@@Italy’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20) last year coincided with a moment of great cooperation among countries.@@@It is a legacy that we must not dissipate.@@@In that regard, I recall Rome’s readiness to host World Expo 2030 in order to continue to offer shared solutions to global problems.@@@At the most acute stage of the pandemic, we took action to overcome protectionism in medical supplies and ensure more vaccines for the world’s poorest regions.@@@Through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility mechanism, we distributed more than 1.4 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the countries that needed them the most.@@@We enhanced financial assistance to vulnerable States to help them respond to the economic consequences of the pandemic and we promoted the extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.@@@Through a newfound spirit of cooperation, we intensified the fight against climate change.@@@For the first time, all G-20 member States pledged to try to keep global warming to within 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and accepted the scientific facts behind that goal.@@@We also agreed on a set of short- and medium-term responses to achieve that goal.@@@The commitments that we made at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow followed shortly thereafter.@@@At the G-20 Summit, we set out new financial contributions to help low-income countries transition to a more sustainable economy.@@@We must continue to support the most vulnerable States in order to help them defend themselves against the impacts of climate change and to pursue their own transition paths.@@@I refer here, for example, to the tragic flooding in Pakistan, where a large part of the country is under water and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes.@@@The environmental crisis affects us all and we must all come out of it together.@@@Italy’s commitment to peace and international solidarity is unceasing.@@@We are the largest contributor of Blue Helmets among European countries, and our military is deployed across five missions in the Mediterranean, Africa and Asia.@@@We participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon with the second-largest contingent.@@@We are very active in promoting dialogue with all countries in the wider Mediterranean.@@@In Libya, we are committed to ensuring that the difficult process of national reconciliation receives strong support from the international community.@@@On that journey, the United Nations remains our main point of reference.@@@I also want to thank United Nations institutions for the valuable humanitarian aid they provide for the management of migration in the Mediterranean.@@@Italy is well aware that migration is a global phenomenon and must be addressed as such.@@@We must take a responsible, humane and shared approach.@@@The war in Ukraine and the resulting crises have strained the cohesion of the international community, but it is precisely in that context that we need to rediscover the spirit of cooperation that has, in the past, enabled us to face similar challenges together.@@@Our common institutions must renew themselves.@@@Italy strongly supports the need to reform the Security Council to make it more representative, efficient and transparent.@@@In the coming years, Italy will continue to be a protagonist in the EU and stand close to its NATO allies, ready to listen, open to dialogue and determined to contribute to international peace and security.@@@Those are the same principles and goals that inspire the United Nations and that we must defend urgently today.@@@I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his outstanding management of the work of the General Assembly at its previous session.@@@I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at this session, and I wish him every success.@@@At the threshold of a new era for the world order, the United Arab Emirates has chosen to embrace peace, recovery and prosperity within an open global system based on a robust network of international relations providing new tracks for joint cooperation in the fields of economics, sustainable development, advanced technology and scientific research.@@@That is the approach adopted by my country in the implementation of its foreign policy, which governs our bilateral relations and multilateral engagements in general and is guiding us throughout our current membership in the Security Council.@@@We are well aware, however, of the magnitude of the significant challenges before us today, as well as the increasing level of polarization that looms over the international system.@@@That is the result of a growing number of crises and new conflict hotspots around the world, together with a dangerous escalation in the activities of armed groups while people around the world are suffering immensely from food and climate crises.@@@Those challenges not only threaten the gains made by humankind, but they also have a severe impact on poor and developing countries and their ability to meet the needs of their peoples.@@@Such issues call into question the effectiveness of the current international order.@@@However, it is that very system, which was built on the ruins of the Second World War, that has significantly contributed to strengthened international security and stability.@@@What we need today is to restore confidence in the existing international
system and the legitimacy of its institutions through enhancing its efficiency and building its capabilities to address the current crises and overcome the existential challenges of the twenty-first century.@@@The United Arab Emirates believes that, together, all the countries present in this Hall, with the requisite determination, can achieve those ends by combining our capabilities to chart a better future for our peoples.@@@Accordingly, I would like to emphasize a number of issues that demand our attention in the coming period.@@@Recent developments underscore the need to respect international law, in particular, the United Nations Charter.@@@That law must be applied consistently without double standards or selectivity, which is imperative for achieving stability and security in our international order — an order based on respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of States.@@@In that context, we reiterate our demand for an end to Iran’s occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — whose United Arab Emirates sovereignty has been proven by history and international law.@@@Despite the sincere calls of my country to peacefully resolve this conflict over the past five decades, we note that Iran has not responded.@@@However, we will never relent in voicing our legitimate right over those islands, whether through direct negotiations or through the International Court of Justice.@@@We must spare no effort to overcome the fatigue that has become the most obvious characteristic of current international approaches to addressing crises.@@@We need to find permanent, comprehensive and fair solutions to the escalating armed conflicts around the world and to address the repercussions of turmoil on the international scene.@@@Therefore, the next stage requires us to adopt innovative solutions in order to enhance the effectiveness of our international system and enable countries and regions with conflicts to play a constructive role in addressing the challenges of our era.@@@For decades, the Arab world and African continent have been hit hardest by crises.@@@As a direct result, we have learned difficult yet critical lessons.@@@We must prioritize diplomatic solutions, dialogue and de-escalation in order to ease tensions, prevent new conflicts from emerging and combat extremist ideologies.@@@The recent positive developments in our region aimed at building bridges are prominent examples of overcoming previous differences and forging new partnerships based on cooperation in various fields and supporting critical sectors such as health, education and industry, as well as strengthening the role of women.@@@We stress our firm position on the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the borders of 4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the agreed international terms of reference.@@@We welcome the affirmation by the Prime Minister of the State of Israel in his statement from this rostrum regarding support for the vision of the two- State solution (see A/77/PV.8).@@@We also look forward to advancing all political processes in our region and paving pathways to peace.@@@However, that should be complemented by strengthening the united international position that rejects interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.@@@That type of interference undermines conflict resolution, fuels extremism and terrorism and constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of States.@@@In the light of the increasing frequency of crises, it becomes imperative to enhance the role of regional and international organizations by holding consultations and providing them with the necessary tools, resources and expertise in order to enable them to effectively respond to current challenges.@@@Regional organizations are more familiar with local contexts and better positioned to support mediation efforts.@@@We have seen that repeatedly, including through the efforts of the African Union, whose initiatives we applaud and support.@@@As we all know, the maintenance of international peace and security requires a world free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula.@@@It also requires promoting dialogue to reduce tensions and to address regional and international concerns in that regard.@@@It is impossible to speak of a secure and stable international order in the absence of a firm international position rejecting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and committed to holding the perpetrators and financers of terrorism accountable.@@@Recently we have seen an increase in the flow of weapons and fighters of different backgrounds into conflict zones, in addition to the emergence of groups with high combat and military capabilities.@@@Those fighters subsequently return to their countries of origin without having mechanisms to control them.@@@In addition, the situation becomes increasingly dangerous owing to terrorists’ use of missiles and drones to launch cross-border attacks.@@@Those developments reflect the evolving nature of terrorism and require efforts to prevent conflict zones from becoming a safe haven for terrorists and to update and develop means of deterrence and adopt international rules and regulations that prevent terrorists from obtaining advanced weapons and technology.@@@That threat manifested itself clearly in the Houthi terrorist group’s heinous and hostile attacks earlier this year against the capital of my country, Abu Dhabi, as well as against the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.@@@At the same time, other terrorist groups, such as Da’esh, Al-Qaida, and Al-Shabaab, seek to develop their capabilities and reorganize their ranks, which directly threaten the gains made as a result of international cooperation in the war against terrorism.@@@As Governments, we must lead our people by example by establishing the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the face of increasing attempts to spread hate speech around the world.@@@In addition, and in the light of humankind’s shared destiny, it is imperative that we acknowledge the need for joint action.@@@We must harness our shared capabilities and energy to implement comprehensive solutions and responses that rise to the level of the existential challenges that we face today and are not limited to a specific country or region.@@@There is no clearer example of that than the implications of climate change.@@@People around the world are exposed to devastating floods, heat waves and drought, all of which exacerbate humanitarian crises and security threats, especially in areas most vulnerable to climate change.@@@All those facts confirm that the fate of our planet is at stake.@@@We must therefore forge partnerships, promote joint action and commit to supporting climate action by adopting the renewable energy agenda, providing adequate funding for climate action and supporting developing countries in building resilient communities.@@@It has become clear that investing in renewable energy means investing in the economy, international peace and security and future generations.@@@In that regard, we must take advantage of available opportunities to create practical, rational and thoughtful solutions to the climate crisis, including during the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt in November.@@@We urge all Member States to actively engage in that meeting.@@@While my country prepares to host the twenty-eighth session next year, we are working to build partnerships, ensure inclusivity and focus on areas in which we can achieve meaningful results to address the phenomenon of climate change.@@@Furthermore, focusing on climate change will relieve the food crisis around the world.@@@The Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, launched by the United Arab Emirates in cooperation with the United States, aims to improve food production and reduce hunger levels around the world.@@@Simultaneously, we must intensify food assistance to all peoples and ensure the continued flow of global food supplies, while also looking for practical ways to secure supply chains in the light of the current geopolitical divisions.@@@Despite the gravity of the current challenges and the importance of addressing them, we must not disregard the need to ensure long-term stability and prosperity.@@@In that regard, my country is building a diversified, knowledge-based economy that relies on scientific and technological progress as well as peaceful and secure communities.@@@Two years after Abraham Accords, several initiatives took place this year to promote regional integration and strengthen cooperation in the development and economic fields across our region.@@@We are witnessing today the rise of a community for progress in the Middle East, which will bolster joint cooperation with regard to the major global priorities.@@@In young people we see the best ability to mobilize such efforts, as demonstrated by their resilience and innovation in the face of the current crises, as well as their unparalleled passion to connect with their peers around the world and find sustainable solutions to global challenges.@@@We will therefore not give up on the potential of young people or our investment in them to ensure that they remain pillars and leaders of the future.@@@We also believe that the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in various fields contributes to advancing societies, thereby ensuring their stability now and in the future.@@@In conclusion, the United Arab Emirates reiterates that it will continue its approach to humanitarian, diplomatic and development support for all peoples affected by crises and disasters, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, political affiliation or culture.@@@We will continue to work with all friends and partners to build the capabilities and capacities of Governments and peoples across all fields for the universal common good.@@@That approach remains the beacon of our efforts throughout all forums.@@@I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly on his election.@@@I am confident that his stewardship will lend further credence to the impactful role of multilateralism in resolving global challenges.@@@I thank his predecessor, Mr. Abdullah Shahid, for his shrewd leadership over the past year.@@@I had the distinct privilege of welcoming him recently to Guyana and benefiting from his experience in championing an inclusive future for our young people.@@@I extend congratulations to him, the Secretary-General and the General Assembly for the recently adopted resolution on the establishment of the United Nations Youth Office (resolution 76/306).@@@One month ago, in Guyana, I launched the Youth Advisory Council as part of my Government’s commitment to ensuring the involvement of young people in decision-making and development as the Government works towards building Guyana’s future.@@@We live in a troubled world that has lost its balance.@@@Indeed, our collective actions as leaders today will convey to the next generation that their aspirations and their future and that of the planet are worth fighting for.@@@The international community faces a series of interlocking challenges — a global pandemic, climate challenges, energy and food crises and inter-State conflicts.@@@As a consequence of the pandemic, approximately 97 million more persons are living on less than $1.90 per day, thereby significantly increasing the global poverty rate and inequalities.@@@The developing world lost revenues and income that were earmarked for achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), pushing us farther away from our 2030 targets.@@@A United Nations report issued in March 2022 spoke definitively about the unequal distribution of coronavirus disease vaccines and its impact on widening economic disparity between the rich and the poor.@@@The study found that low-income countries could have increased their gross domestic product by $16.7 billion dollars in 2021 if they had had a vaccination rate similar to that of high-income developed countries.@@@How will we address that inequality?@@@How will we address that injustice?@@@Guyana’s position is that there must be an immediate re-examination of the financing gap and debt portfolio of developing countries to open fiscal space and create an opportunity for recovery, bridging the gap and attaining the SDGs.@@@Guyana welcomes the global initiatives on pandemic preparedness.@@@It is imperative that we collectively discuss how to address any potential pandemic and health threats so that we are better equipped in the future to avoid the inequalities that exist.@@@The global food security problem has disproportionately affected us.@@@The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity has trended upwards since 2014, with an estimated increase in 2020 equalling that of the previous five years combined.@@@In 2020, 2.37 billion of the world’s population was food- insecure.@@@In addition, the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warned that acute food insecurity would worsen in 20 hunger hotspots from June to September 2022.@@@Since the start of the pandemic, global food prices have surged by 65 per cent and are expected to remain high over the medium term as a result of supply chain constraints, a hike in energy costs, higher shipping costs, climate issues, the war in Ukraine and the fertilizer crisis.@@@Also, following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, global food prices increased sharply — to reach an all-time high in February 2022.@@@FAO projects that the production of cereals — a crop heavily relied on throughout the world — will decline by 40 million tons, or 1.4 per cent in 2022 as compared to 2021.@@@The trajectory of the global food import bill is a whopping $1.8 trillion this year, a record high.@@@The global food import bill is projected to rise by $51 billion from 2021, $49 billion of which reflects higher prices.@@@The question is what we are going to do about it.@@@Can the reversal of export bans on rice and wheat and the freeing up of grains help that situation?@@@The answer is a resounding yes.@@@For example, export bans on rice from India and wheat from Russia contributed to a price increase of 12.3 per cent and 9 per cent for rice and wheat, respectively.@@@The President returned to the Chair.@@@As world leaders, we must find the balance now.@@@In honouring our commitment to promote peace, stability, respect for territorial integrity and democracy and the human rights of all, we must work collectively to prevent situations that can widen inequality and create social and economic havoc.@@@Now is the time for us to decide if a new approach is needed to guarantee food
security, energy security, climate security, access to health care and quality education, and security from conflict and wars.@@@According to the World Bank and Global Trade Alert, between January and June 2022, 135 policy measures were announced or implemented that affected the trade in food and fertilizer.@@@During the same period, 34 nations imposed restrictive export measures on food and fertilizers.@@@The question, therefore, is whether globalization is applicable only under normal conditions or whether it is opportunistic in its application.@@@When a crisis arises, do we lock ourselves in and forget about multilateralism and globalization?@@@The evidence is glaring, first with regard to COVID-19 vaccines and more recently with respect to access to food and fertilizer.@@@A welcome initiative is FAO’s Global Food Import Financing Facility, which seeks to respond to the prevailing soaring food import costs and address the needs of those most exposed.@@@However, there is a need to revise the eligibility criteria to accommodate countries beyond the categories of low-income and lower-middle-income groups.@@@Those narrow groupings heighten the chance that many at-risk, economically vulnerable countries, including those in the Caribbean with large food and food-import needs, will be excluded.@@@We all recognize that there is climate crisis.@@@We must review some of the decisions made.@@@For example, at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), we agreed that there would be no more coal-fired power projects.@@@What is the reality?@@@While policies and planning for climate change adaptation are expanding, financing and implementation are still far behind where they should be, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm.@@@That analysis shows that the costs of adaptation are most likely to be higher than the predicted range of $140-300 billion annually by 2030 and $280-500 billion annually by 2050 for developing nations.@@@In 2019, $79.6 billion was allocated to developing nations for planning and carrying out mitigation and adaptation measures.@@@The gap between predicted adaptation costs and existing public adaptation finance flows is generally growing and ranges from a fivefold to a tenfold shortfall.@@@The paltry $100 billion pledge and the failure to meet it must be viewed in the context of the likely costs of climate action for mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage.@@@It is not enough.@@@The adoption in Glasgow of broad rules on carbon markets has the potential to unlock critical resources for forest-rich countries.@@@Forested countries such as Guyana can potentially earn billions of dollars through voluntary carbon markets.@@@However, the current approximate price is $10 per ton on the voluntary market, while according to an International Monetary Fund report the price should be closer to $70 per ton.@@@At the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties, we must make progress in refining the rules for the implementation of article 6 of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and make decisions that will increase the price of carbon traded in voluntary carbon markets.@@@The world is also faced with an energy crisis.@@@In 2019, almost 10 per cent of the world’s population did not have access to electricity.@@@The volume of electricity generated by fossil fuels increased by 178 per cent between 2000 and 2021 — in particular, the volume of electricity generated by coal increased by 173 per cent between 2000 and 2021.@@@Based on a recent energy outlook report issued by the United States Energy Information Administration, coal-fired generation is expected to be a key energy component as a result of several factors, including a drop in the share of natural gas and rising oil prices.@@@While all of that is occurring, the global energy demand is projected to increase by 47 per cent in the next 30 years.@@@According to the International Energy Agency, global electricity demand grew by 6 per cent in 2021 and is projected to grow by 2.4 per cent in 2022 — only 50 per cent of which is expected to be met from renewable energy sources.@@@As such, the other 50 per cent will have to be met from non-renewable energy sources.@@@Also, analysis by the International Energy Agency indicates that getting on the path to net-zero emissions by 2050 would require a threefold increase in the current level of investments in the clean energy transition to reach approximately $4 trillion by 2030.@@@The question, therefore, is how we realistically strike that balance.@@@The conversation must be practical, comprehensive and fact-based.@@@We all recognize that adjustments must be made to save our planet.@@@But how will we craft that adjustment, considering that our energy and food crises are also critical, and how will we ensure that inequality and lack of access do not worsen?@@@In this energy transition, fossil fuels are still necessary.@@@In that context, we believe that new entrants like Guyana must be part of that balanced approach.@@@Even as a new entrant, at COP26 Guyana proposed ending subsidies for fossil-fuel production and advocated the need for a strong global carbon price.@@@However, we do not believe that new entrants should be punished by removing access to financing and increasing financing costs.@@@In effect, that will only protect an existing monopoly, drive up the costs of investment and deliver a higher- priced product.@@@We are committed to building a Guyana that addresses the issues of food security, climate change, energy security and inequalities within our country and the region.@@@Under the banner of One Guyana, my Government has embarked on many initiatives to help bridge the gaps of inequality and access.@@@We are on a path to reducing Guyana’s food import bill and increasing food security through expanded cultivation and investments in new technology and climate-smart agriculture, all aimed at positioning Guyana as a leading food producer in the Caribbean Community.@@@We are working to provide incentives, capital, land and opportunities for young people and women to participate in our agricultural transformation.@@@To that end, we have earmarked 35 per cent of all new agribusinesses to be led by women, and we have increased youth participation in agriculture with the use of technology by more than 40 per cent.@@@We are pursuing a low-carbon development strategy, aimed at creating a model for value ecosystem services and sustainably developing and managing the blue economy, investing in clean energy and stimulating low-carbon growth, protecting against climate change and biodiversity loss and aligning with global climate and biodiversity goals.@@@Our forests, whose area is equivalent to the size of England, store 19.5 gigatons of carbon with a deforestation rate of less than 0.05 per cent.@@@We intend to continue the sustainable management of our forests as a key national and global good.@@@Having already achieved net zero in emissions, we are working steadfastly in our transition from a 2020 status of 95 per cent dependence on heavy fuel oil and diesel to an energy mix that includes hydropower, solar, wind and natural gas, from which more than 500 megawatts of new generating capacity will come on stream.@@@Of that generated energy, 87 per cent will be from clean and renewable sources.@@@Human resource transformation through education is a key driver of our development.@@@The achievement of inclusive and equitable quality education and the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all are inextricably linked to attaining our Sustainable Development Goals, including full employment, poverty eradication and gender equality.@@@Access to free, quality primary and secondary education will soon be followed by free tertiary education.@@@The Government of Guyana has invested in our indigenous communities through infrastructure, education, training, health care and the installation of Internet access capabilities.@@@We have also begun training our workforce for 2030 and beyond.@@@Soon we will be offering coding skills at both the primary and secondary school levels.@@@Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all areas of life are national priorities.@@@We are committed to ensuring equal access to education for girls and boys.@@@Indeed, more girls are attending school in Guyana and graduating from university, and our focus now includes ensuring that our boys are not left behind.@@@We have initiated several programmes to create earning and employment opportunities for women and to promote their financial independence, recognizing that their empowerment is inextricably linked to addressing the root causes of discrimination and gender-based violence and eradicating them.@@@To achieve balanced growth and sustainable and resilient development for Guyana, our strategies must focus on developing a diversified economic base, strengthening our agricultural and food production systems, transforming our human resources, investing in the social sector to deliver world class health, education and housing for all our people, ensuring an inclusive and equitable society in which prosperity is enjoyed by all, and building our future through the strengthening of our democratic values and respect for the rule of law.@@@As part of the global family, Guyana subscribes to the rules-based international order and to the need for a resurgence of political will and commitment to protecting the multilateral architecture.@@@We are deeply concerned about the number of persons living in conflict situations.@@@The ongoing war in Ukraine is having terrible effects on that country and region,
with the impact disproportionately felt by women and children.@@@We urge for a speedy and peaceful resolution of the conflict and express support for the efforts of the Secretary-General in that regard.@@@In our own region, we again join an overwhelming majority of members of the international community in reiterating Guyana’s rejection of the sanctions imposed on Cuba.@@@Guyana also affirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people and its support for their dignified existence in their own homeland in accordance with a two-State solution.@@@Guyana does not condone or support the threat or use of force in relations between States or in the resolution of disputes.@@@Consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, we subscribe to the use of peaceful means to settle disputes.@@@In that context, we thank those who have expressed support for our candidacy for non-permanent membership in the Security Council.@@@With regard to the challenge and threat posed to Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by Venezuela, we remain — in the words of the Secretary- General at the opening of the general debate yesterday (see A/77/PV.4) — “committed to making the most of every diplomatic tool available to us for the pacific settlement of disputes”, as set out in the Charter.@@@In our case, that tool is a judicial settlement, as determined by the Secretary-General himself.@@@The world’s nations can rest assured that Guyana will remain true to those peaceful processes and deny any effort to depart from them.@@@The International Court of Justice has already affirmed its jurisdiction on the matter.@@@The Assembly must reinvigorate the spirit of multilateralism in finding solutions to the challenges that continue to bedevil the global community of States.@@@I would like to conclude by reminding us all of the old saying that “A hungry man is an angry man”.@@@Global inequality is linked to global insecurity, and global security is linked to the prosperity of all humankind.@@@I begin by congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his unanimous election to preside over the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I also express appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for successfully steering the seventy-sixth session.@@@My deep appreciation goes to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his commendable efforts to promote global peace, security, human rights and development.@@@There could have been no better time to deliberate on “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, the theme of this year’s general debate.@@@We are living indeed in a watershed moment — a moment when the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, geopolitical tensions, inequalities and climate crisis threaten our pursuit of peace and prosperity; a moment when the values of solidarity and cooperation are put to test, with trust and confidence in short supply; a moment when humankind is caught between hope and despair, unity and division, and harmony and dissension; and a moment, when the world is striving to forge a new consensus amid competing interests, priorities and challenges.@@@For the third year in a row, COVID-19 continues to add strain to our lives, livelihoods and economies.@@@But there is hope.@@@The production and availability of COVID-19 vaccines have minimized the risk and severity of the disease and enhanced our ability to save lives.@@@In Nepal, we have been able to fully vaccinate 96 per cent of the target population, with almost everyone receiving at least one dose.@@@We thank our immediate neighbours, India and China, our development partners and the United Nations system for their valuable support.@@@But that is not the case everywhere.@@@Poor and vulnerable people in many parts of the world have still been kept away from the “dose of hope”.@@@The pandemic will not end unless it ends for all people in all countries.@@@We must ensure vaccine equity so that no one is left behind.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at risk.@@@The pandemic has hit our march into the decade of action hard.@@@This has been followed by cascading crises marked by geopolitical divides, the disruption of supply chain and the climate emergency.@@@The resulting high food and fuel price, massive inflation and debt burden have severely hit the limited fiscal capacity of the poorer countries, especially the least developed ones.@@@All these crises have a cumulative negative impact on the financing of the SDGs.@@@It is more acute in the countries in special situations, such as the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries (LDCs) and the small island developing States.@@@As per the pre-pandemic estimate, Nepal would require an average annual investment of $19 billion to achieve the SDGs.@@@With the shortfall of financing,
our hard-earned development gains are at risk at a time when we are preparing to graduate from LDC status by 2026.@@@However, graduation is our long-held aspiration, and we remain committed to using this opportunity to bring a structural transformation to the national economy.@@@We will do everything possible to make our graduation process smooth, sustainable and irreversible.@@@For that, we need additional international support in the form of investment, technology transfer, aid for trade and technical assistance.@@@That is critical for us to recover from the pandemic, rescue the SDGs and turn global partnership into a reality.@@@No country can thrive without integration into the global market.@@@The rising tide of protectionism and stalled trade negotiations are delaying the much-needed reform in the international trading system, which is tipped in favour of some.@@@The poorer countries are yet to benefit from it.@@@We must ensure open, fair and transparent trade rules so that all countries can benefit from it.@@@Similarly, the current global financial system has seriously failed the developing world.@@@It is unfair to continue this undemocratic and unresponsive system.@@@We call for the much-needed reform of international financial architecture and for making it inclusive, fair and equally beneficial to all.@@@The countries under debt stress need urgent debt relief, restructuring and cancellation.@@@The international community must swiftly help them emerge from their debt crises.@@@In Nepal, we are bearing the disproportionate burden of climate change and facing such climate shocks as frequent landslides, storms, floods and wildfires.@@@The melting of glaciers and the drying-up of snow-fed rivers have been adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of people downstream and rendering us one of the most vulnerable countries.@@@Our region recently experienced the heartbreaking loss of lives and properties due to unusually heavy downpours, the melting of the glaciers and resulting floods.@@@To combat the climate crisis and address vulnerabilities, we have localized adaptation plans.@@@While remaining fully committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we have set the ambitious target of reaching a net-zero scenario by 2045, as announced by the Prime Minister of Nepal, The Right Honourable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@However, climate change is a global problem, and it needs global action.@@@To that end, the large emitters, which account for over 80 per cent of all global emissions, must take bold steps to keep the 1.5°C climate goal alive.@@@The commitment of $100 billion in climate financing must turn into a reality.@@@The twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change needs to move from pledges into action.@@@Geopolitics and polarization have pushed global peace and security into peril.@@@The world is becoming more complex with rising transnational challenges such as terrorism, radicalism, extremism and mass migration.@@@Today the world faces the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945, within and between countries, divided by the fault lines of race, religion, ethnicity and origin.@@@The question that keeps haunting us today is whether enough is being done to protect the people from the scourge of wars by preventing them from happening in the first place.@@@Investment in the prevention of conflicts is more effective than addressing their consequences.@@@Technological advances today have the capacity to inflict devastating physical action instantly, and yet it is appalling to see how our world body gets crippled when it comes to the interplay of the interests of the major Powers in the Security Council.@@@As our dependence on new technology deepens, the issue of cybersecurity has emerged as one of the greatest challenges that demands our collective resolve to setting norms and building capacity to prevent the threat it poses.@@@We must also put in place the necessary safeguards to curb the malicious use of new technologies.@@@In 2021, global military spending surpassed $2 trillion.@@@Countries are chasing an elusive notion of security by leaving billions of people hungry, sick and destitute.@@@Genuine security depends on the ability to address the underlying causes of conflict: poverty, hunger and unemployment.@@@The stockpiles of nuclear arsenals constitute perpetual threat to humankind.@@@Therefore, their elimination is the only guarantee of the non-use of these weapons in the future.@@@Nepal reiterates its call for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons, in a time-bound manner.@@@Nepal opposes the arms race in outer space and emphasizes the peaceful use of outer space for the benefit of humankind.@@@As the host of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal continues to support regional disarmament initiatives as building blocks of global disarmament.@@@We remain committed to reviving the Kathmandu process, which we believe complements global arms control and disarmament efforts.@@@Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and calls for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism.@@@We are deeply concerned about the deaths and suffering of civilians in the war in Ukraine.@@@We call for an urgent cessation of hostilities and violence, and urge all concerned parties to exercise maximum restraint and return to the path of dialogue.@@@Nepal opposes any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty of a country under any pretext and circumstance.@@@Afghanistan has remained on the precipice of uncertainties and violence.@@@The Afghan people are exposed to a shocking level of poverty and humanitarian suffering.@@@We call for unhindered humanitarian aid and public services, including health and education for all sections of Afghan society, to be ensured.@@@We urge all parties concerned in Myanmar to respect the will of the people to elect their representatives, paving the way to restoring the democratic process.@@@The people of Libya, Syria and Yemen have been facing hardships and sufferings for too long.@@@The concerned parties need to resort to peaceful means of conflict resolution to end the violence and return to peace.@@@Protracted violence and conflict continue to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinian and Israeli civilians.@@@Nepal reiterates its long-standing view for a two-State solution, whereby Palestine and Israel will live side by side in peace and security within the recognized international borders.@@@Nepal pursues the path of a democratic system, with the people’s welfare at the centre.@@@Our democratic process is characterized by the people’s struggle, sacrifice, dialogue and resilience.@@@In May, we successfully held democratic elections to local Governments in a peaceful, free and fair manner.@@@We are now set to hold periodic elections for the federal Parliament and provincial assemblies in November.@@@For a democracy like Nepal, these are much more than just periodic elections.@@@They are a testament to our ability to ensure the peaceful transfer of power.@@@They are the means to enhance people’s trust in democracy, promote legitimacy and accountability, and strengthen the rule of law.@@@The principles of inclusion and participation constitute the core of Nepal’s governance system.@@@The Constitution of Nepal guarantees the proportional representation and participation of all sections of our society in national life.@@@It guarantees at least 33 per cent representation of women in federal and provincial parliaments and 40 per cent at the local Government level.@@@As a result, the participation of women, youth and disadvantaged groups has increased significantly in politics and other spheres of national life.@@@It has not only ensured their rightful place, but also injected dynamism, justice and fairness into society.@@@Nepal’s commitment to human rights is unequivocal.@@@The Constitution of Nepal incorporates universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.@@@As a member of the Human Rights Council for a second consecutive term, Nepal continues to add value to the work of the Council.@@@Our approach to human rights is firmly grounded in the principles of universality, indivisibility, objectivity and non-selectivity.@@@We are committed to concluding the transitional justice process by addressing the concerns of the victims, complying with the directives of the Supreme Court and abiding by the spirit of Comprehensive Peace Accord and our relevant international commitments.@@@Taking this in earnest, the Government of Nepal has presented an amendment bill to Parliament to reform the related laws.@@@We uphold the rights of the child as the most sacred obligation of the State, with their protection, well-being, health, education and development at the centre.@@@We attach high importance to the safety, security, dignity and well-being of migrant workers and emphasize the effective implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.@@@We also attach high importance to quality education, skills, entrepreneurship and employment for young people in order to unleash the potential for sustained economic development, peace and prosperity in society.@@@We recognize the significant role that the diaspora can play to bring capital, technology and skills to the country of origin.@@@Though we are not a party to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its Protocol, we have been hosting thousands of refugees on humanitarian grounds.@@@We believe that the forced eviction of citizens, anywhere and under any circumstances, is a grave crime.@@@Refugees’ right to return to their homeland in safety, honour and dignity must always be ensured.@@@The cardinal principle of seeing the world as one family shapes our worldview in external relations.@@@Our foreign policy dwells on the notions of peace, non-violence and non-aggression, which find their eloquent expression in the teachings of Gautam Buddha, the enlightened son of Nepal.@@@Nepal enjoys cordial relations with all countries around the world.@@@That is a result of both my country’s historical evolution and the friendly nature of our people.@@@Given the good will Nepal receives from our friends, we feel the need to contribute more to international peace, progress and social justice.@@@We engage with our neighbours and friends in the international community based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, non-alignment, Panchsheel, international law and the norms of world peace.@@@We play active roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue to promote regional cooperation.@@@Our partnership with the United Nations has been built on the foundation of trust and cooperation.@@@We firmly believe in multilateralism, with the United Nations at its centre.@@@With its unmatched coverage, legitimacy and convening power, the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for promoting global cooperation based on sovereign equality and mutual respect.@@@Currently the second-largest troop- and police-contributing country, Nepal has been a consistent contributor to United Nations peacekeeping for the past six and a half decades.@@@We have deployed our peacekeepers at every call and without caveat, even in difficult situations.@@@Nepal supports all major initiatives aimed at reforming UN peace operations.@@@We have endorsed the Kigali Principles and the Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) and A4P+ initiatives, among others.@@@We have a zero- case policy against sexual exploitation and abuse in peace operations.@@@We condemn targeted attacks against Blue Helmets.@@@The perpetrators of such crimes should be brought to justice.@@@We believe that countries should have fair share of leadership positions at Headquarters and in the field, according to the level and history of their contribution to United Nations peacekeeping.@@@Nepal supports United Nations reform initiatives, including revitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council to make it more representative, inclusive and transparent.@@@We also support reform initiatives based on the Secretary- General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@Those endeavours will not produce results unless the Member States take bold and transformative steps to make our Organization fit for the future.@@@We must enable the United Nations to deliver on the needs of the furthest behind first.@@@To conclude, the decisions we make today will determine what our future will look like.@@@Our choice to act or not to act will have a huge impact on generations to come.@@@Let us look at what opportunities lie ahead of us.@@@Let us give solidarity and cooperation a chance.@@@As a peace-loving country, Nepal remains committed to contributing to our collective efforts of making this world peaceful, prosperous and equitable.@@@On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, I would first like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and the members of the Bureau.@@@We assure him with absolute certainty that he will be able to count on the support and cooperation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea during his presidency.@@@The past few years have been very difficult for humankind owing to the emergence of a series of multifaceted crises ranging from the desolation brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to the energy crisis; deteriorating food security; the monetary crisis, aggravated by the current tense international situation just as we are commemorating the seventy-seventh anniversary of the creation of the
United Nations and coinciding with the war between Russia and Ukraine.@@@Today’s global situation is calling on and compelling us to make use of innovative and multilateral cooperation focused on human solidarity.@@@Indeed, and as is stated in the motto of this seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly, this is a watershed moment for world leaders to search for lasting, consensual, transformative and sustainable solutions to the interlocking challenges that have a transversal impact on every continent on the planet.@@@We are living in a globalized world, and it is therefore to be hoped that we will forge partnerships of solidarity, support and multilateral cooperation, through frank dialogue, to address inequalities and settle our differences.@@@Equatorial Guinea is today launching an appeal on the need and importance of enhancing multilateralism and international cooperation, which are so necessary to address those global challenges and to revive development and sustainable economic growth in our countries, especially developing countries.@@@We need to promote the building and strengthening of different infrastructure, especially health infrastructure, in order to face not only potential new pandemics, but also endemic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.@@@From the establishment of the United Nations until today and into the future, the maintenance of international peace and security is essential to the development and prosperity of Member States.@@@The coexistence of traditional conflicts and emerging challenges, such as transnational crime, cybersecurity, biosecurity, climate change and piracy, among others, are becoming increasingly prominent, which means that the current world situation can be solved only by seeking peace by all means necessary through negotiations and inclusive dialogues.@@@Equatorial Guinea calls on the countries involved in the ongoing conflicts, as well as on the Governments directly or indirectly involved in those conflicts due to geostrategic, economic or other interests, to prioritize dialogue and inclusive negotiations, in a realistic and pragmatic way, to resolve them.@@@In that connection, we again call on the Assembly to collectively denounce and categorically reject the constant foreign interference destabilizing some countries of the world.@@@The African continent must remain at the heart of initiatives to support and finance development with the decisive implementation of the commitments for financing sustainable development in order to implement the goals contained in the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 of the African Union, leaving no one behind, and funding support for peacekeeping as a prerequisite for addressing the phenomenon of terrorism, migration, human trafficking, piracy, mercenaryism, among others, as factors that hinder Africa’s development.@@@Faced with their own humanitarian challenges, the Heads of State and Government of the African Union met in Malabo in May for an extraordinary summit and a donor roundtable to discuss and provide the necessary support to address the humanitarian challenges facing Africa, which have been exacerbated by the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 and disasters across the continent, in order to find lasting solutions to the current humanitarian crisis, especially humanitarian funding.@@@In that context, we welcome and appreciate the Global Security Initiative presented by the People’s Republic of China, whose precepts are relevant to the current global situation.@@@Equatorial Guinea is committed to the promotion of human rights and has therefore designed a wide range of national strategies and standards to strengthen rights, such as the rights of the child and of persons with disabilities and the right to food, to equal access to vaccines against pandemics, to housing and so forth.@@@In terms of the promotion of justice and international law, Equatorial Guinea stressed the need to reform the United Nations system, including the Security Council, whose structure today is one of the great injustices within the United Nations and reflects a serious lack of the democratic spirit in the Organization.@@@Africa, in the framework of the Ezulwini Consensus, has been calling for that injustice to be corrected for more than 15 years through the allocation to Africa of two permanent seats and two additional non-permanent seats on the Security Council.@@@Within the same context of the promotion of justice and international law, we call for the lifting, once and for all, of the commercial, economic and financial embargo imposed on Cuba six decades ago.@@@That brotherly country deserves the opportunity to play its part on the global stage as a sovereign country.@@@In Central Africa, we remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis situation caused by maritime piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, the perpetrators of which are increasingly acquiring ever more sophisticated methods for greater autonomy in the open sea, with
consequent harm and damage to the countries of the subregion.@@@We welcome resolution 2634 (2022), recently adopted by the Security Council, calling on countries of the Gulf of Guinea to criminalize piracy and armed robbery at sea under their domestic laws, and to investigate and prosecute or extradite, in accordance with applicable international law, perpetrators of piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as those who incite, finance or intentionally facilitate such crimes.@@@As His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has always expressed in international forums, and in particular at last year’s seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly (see A/76/PV.11), we wish to insist on the imperative proposal of the need to organize a Summit on the Gulf of Guinea in order to design a strategy to stop all terrorist activities and attempts that threaten regional and international peace and security, as well as to pool our efforts to advance the region and tackle the challenges that surround it.@@@In conclusion, I wish to once again express my congratulations to the President of the General Assembly and to wish him every success during his presidency.@@@We again encourage Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to continue his noble work on United Nations reforms and to resolutely support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace.@@@We also express our strong desire that the United Nations assume its role as mediator in world conflicts in order to reach peaceful, just and negotiated solutions that avoid the use of weapons, which are not the appropriate means for the resolution of any conflict.@@@I share the warm greetings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the entire population of Mexico.@@@In 2022, we are facing one of the most serious crises in recent times, which has had an impact on the global order, international peace and security, the economy, the supply of basic commodities and essential services.@@@Humanitarian assistance needs have multiplied, inequality has unfortunately grown, and the negative effects of climate change have also increased.@@@In addition to health security, which has been weakened by the pandemic, there is a serious threat posed to food security for large segments of the populations in the poorest and most marginalized countries.@@@Furthermore, the current situation is marked by an increase in geopolitical tensions among the major Powers.@@@Just as it seemed that we were recovering from the grave effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the war in Ukraine erupted, bringing with it the risk of a nuclear accident and its potentially catastrophic consequences.@@@In addition to its high cost in terms of human lives and impact on millions of internally displaced persons and refugees in third countries, the war in Ukraine has affected the availability of food and fuel throughout the world.@@@Together with other unresolved armed conflicts, the war in Ukraine is seriously undermining cooperation and the global order based on international law.@@@As a responsible State committed to the promotion of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Mexico would like to make the following proposal before the General Assembly to foster dialogue and peace in Ukraine.@@@The Security Council — it must be said — has been unable to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations by having failed to prevent the war, take the measures needed to end the armed aggression and, to a greater degree, initiate any diplomatic process to seek a solution through dialogue and negotiations.@@@It has also been unable to ensure the delivery of the all the humanitarian assistance required and, unfortunately, to openly support the work of the Secretary-General and other actors in managing access to the markets for Russian- and Ukrainian-produced grain and fertilizer.@@@Confronted by that paralysis, we had to resort to the General Assembly and convene its eleventh special emergency session, in which Mexico, together with France, proposed the appropriate framework for channelling humanitarian aid in the adoption of resolution ES-11/2, which has undoubtedly been useful but is clearly inadequate in the wake of the destruction and suffering that the war has left behind.@@@For those reasons, as he is aware of our individual and collective responsibility, His Excellency President Lopez Obrador of Mexico proposes that a delegation or caucus of Heads of State and Government encourage and support the Secretary-General’s efforts to promote measures to build trust, which has been lost, between the Russian Federation and Ukraine so as to establish, as soon as possible, the conditions necessary for the parties to avail themselves of the mechanisms designed for the peaceful settlement of disputes, as set forth in the Charter.@@@In other words, before the paralysis of the Security Council, we must provide, inter alia, a diplomatic channel to complement those already in place to communicate with the parties to the conflict, with a view to reducing tensions and harnessing crucial mediation.@@@This proposal has been shared in recent days with the Secretary-General, the parties concerned and the delegations of India and the Holy See, since President Lopez Obrador believes that His Excellency
Narendra Modi and His Holiness Pope Francis, among others, should participate, together with the Secretary- General, in any such delegation.@@@We will continue with the necessary consultations, with the sole purpose of being able to contribute, as an impartial actor and in good faith, to generate the broadest possible support for the efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General and the caucus, whose formation we hope will proceed, with the support of United Nations Member States.@@@For nearly two years, as an elected member of the Security Council, Mexico has sought to address the structural causes of conflicts and promote preventive diplomacy as a central element in the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@We have brought to the Council’s attention issues that had been neglected, such as poverty, corruption and inequality, as underlying factors of conflict, the goal of ensuring mental health as an integral part of humanitarian aid, concepts of masculinity to prevent radicalization and terrorism, the importance of respecting the collective security system established under the Charter and the need for coordination and cooperation in achieving peace among the principal organs of the United Nations.@@@The illicit flow of small arms and light weapons, as a result of their widespread availability, undermines regional and international security.@@@That is why Mexico has urged for the need to take measures to stop their flow.@@@That was also demonstrated by the adoption of Security Council resolution 2616 (2021), on respecting arms embargoes and ensuring that peace operations contribute to strengthening the capacities of national authorities to combat illicit arms trafficking and diversion.@@@We have also advocated for transparency, efficiency, accountability and equitable participation in the Council’s work.@@@In that regard, Mexico will continue to advocate a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, including more seats and with longer terms of office in the elected-member category, to make it more representative, transparent and efficient.@@@The paralysis of the Security Council is the result of the abuse of the poorly named “right of veto” by some of its permanent members.@@@During this plenary meeting, two of them have even explicitly referred to the need to restrict its use to truly exceptional situations.@@@In that regard, Mexico and France have continued to advocate that the permanent members refrain from resorting to the veto in situations of mass atrocities.@@@We invite those States that have not yet done so to join that initiative, which is already supported by 106 States.@@@In the meantime, Mexico and 83 other States have promoted an accountability mechanism whereby, each time a veto is recorded in the Security Council, the General Assembly would meet without delay to discuss the issue and invite the author or authors of the veto to explain their position or positions.@@@That proposal, which was adopted unanimously by resolution 76/262 and has already been used twice, points in the right direction.@@@It is now up to us to decide whether we want to take the subsequent steps to prevent the system from continuing to be paralysed in the face of massive human suffering.@@@Nuclear weapons continue to represent the worst threat to the very survival of humankind.@@@Mexico regrets the lack of political will, particularly on the part of the nuclear-weapon States, to reach agreements to achieve that goal, something that was confirmed at the recent Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which did not achieve any results, even though the risks of nuclear proliferation are becoming more real and obvious every day.@@@My country agrees with the Secretary-General’s vision that a safer and more peaceful world must be based on international law, cooperation and solidarity — and not on the incessant accumulation and modernization of nuclear and conventional arsenals.@@@It was precisely that vision that led the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to establish the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area through the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which led to the conclusion and entry into force, in recent years, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Mexico reaffirms that the United Nations continues to be a unique tool of the international community for the peaceful resolution of disputes and the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Our country will continue to promote multilateralism, international solidarity and cooperation as the best way to face global challenges.@@@We cannot close the door to political dialogue and diplomatic negotiation.@@@Current international tensions will not be resolved by force.@@@We must secure political understandings and confidence-building mechanisms.@@@Indeed, restoring trust is one of our greatest challenges.@@@Mexico calls on all Member States to work together to achieve the peace we all yearn for, to work as one in post-pandemic recovery with a sustainable and resilient approach that fully considers the needs and priorities of all countries and which puts people at the centre of our actions.@@@The foundation of a better world is justice.@@@All of the hopes and aspirations of humankind are built on justice.@@@Humans have the capacity to create a framework of all-encompassing justice, which means eliminating injustice.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran defends the fight against injustice in all of its forms — against humankind, against spirituality, against the Almighty and against the people of the world — wherever it appears.@@@The desire to be closer to the Creator and the Creator’s teachings exists in all humankind, and we have witnessed a willingness to change in revolutions throughout the history of humankind.@@@Although many movements have never matured into revolution and many revolutions have deviated from their original path, the success of many people and nations, such as the nation of Iran in realizing its aspiration for an Islamic revolution, has strengthened such aspirations in the hearts of people around the world.@@@The Islamic revolution of Iran was the result of Iranians’ drive for justice and fairness.@@@Despite the many conspiracies that Iran has faced over the decades, it has been able to safeguard itself.@@@As a first step, and based on an advanced social and organizational order, the Islamic Republic of Iran was created in order to ensure justice internally and bring to the world a message of justice and fairness.@@@Spirituality and multilateralism were key components in that path.@@@I am grateful and honoured to be the representative of a people and a nation who are the inheritors of a great civilization that has been free for millennia and has always managed to defeat the plots of the enemies who sought to conquer it — a nation that has always seen oppression as an existential enemy and has always fought to eradicate enslavement, from the Babylonians all the way to the Palestinians.@@@We believe in a common fate for humankind, and we support universal justice.@@@What we seek for ourselves, we wish for others, and what we do not wish for ourselves, we do not impose on others.@@@The nation of Iran believes that justice leads to unity and cohesion and warfare leads to destruction.@@@A country that wants to have justice within its own territory, but then creates or trains terrorist groups and unleashes them on other nations outside its borders should be ashamed before humankind and ashamed in the face of the principles of freedom, justice and fairness.@@@Humanity does not belong only to certain parts of the world.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran, drawing inspiration from its Constitution and the spiritual values on which it is based, sees the protection of human rights as one of the most effective ways to ensure and contribute to the protection of the rights of all oppressed people across the globe and considers it one of its inherent duties.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the double standards of some Governments vis-a-vis human rights and sees them as a major factor rendering the subject of human rights banal in the eyes of many.@@@In Iran there has been much discussion of the death of dozens of innocent women in a Western country, and as long as there are such double standards, where attention is focused solely on one party rather than on all of us, equally, we will not have true justice and fairness.@@@Human rights belong to everyone, but they are unfortunately trampled on by many Governments, as was shown by the recent discovery in a Canadian school of mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of children of the native tribes of Canada and as is evidenced with regard to the rights of the Palestinians, the right to life of people whose lands are occupied, those who have fallen victim to terrorism and those who seek freedom and refuge only to see their children locked up in cages.@@@All of that shows that who is accused and who the accuser must not be judged solely based on the representations of some.@@@The right to claim to be protectors of human rights needs to be founded on something, which many lack these days.@@@With regard to the savagery and crimes of Da’esh, which enslaved Christian, Yazidi and other religious minorities, women and children, it has been clear from our attempts to combat them that we have been defenders of human rights and that those who defended and promoted Da’esh are on the side of the accused.@@@Today we are witnessing a change in the world order away from a unilateral world, a hegemonic world, a world in which financial power controls the standards of behaviour, a world where criminal and oppressive sanctions are imposed on nations and international organizations are used as tools of oppression in exerting pressure on defenceless nations, in other words, a world completely lacking in justice and fairness.@@@Support for that order among the world’s peoples and nations has been lost.@@@A new order has taken shape and will undoubtedly be realized.@@@From Lebanon to the occupied territories of Palestine and across our region we see the defeated policies of that outdated system.@@@We see terrorism, we see native cultures and religions trampled on, we see unilateral actions and unjust opposition to multilateralism.@@@All of that has created great obstacles to human progress.@@@We firmly believe that in order to address both old challenges and new contexts, we have no choice but to choose a path of cohesiveness and unity, on a basis of multilateralism, justice, shared human values and divine teachings.@@@There is no other path.@@@We believe that the hearts of all freedom-seeking nations are wedded to those deep-seated values, and their defence against oppressors throughout the world rests on our shoulders.@@@What we are seeking are the rights of the Iranian people and nation.@@@We will not tolerate any relationship based on oppression.@@@We will stand firm and proudly defend our rights.@@@We believe that any oppression is an act against peace and stability, which is a threat to the entire world.@@@Achieving global security through any path other than justice cannot be sustainable or lasting.@@@That is therefore precisely what we expect the United Nations to support and pursue.@@@Of course, implementing justice and fairness is enormously challenging and difficult, and perhaps it is for that reason that many who claim to be on the side of peace run away from the responsibilities of peace.@@@To them we say, “If you do not wish to shoulder the burden, do you not even wish to shoulder the burden of fighting oppression?”@@@Our belief is deeply rooted in the Qur’anic culture, which instructs us to oppress no one, and the fate of many nations is dependent on exactly those principles.@@@When we consider nations that flee the logic of character, fairness and justice and run towards unilateralism and oppressive power; nations that lack reason and rely on coups d’etat, military interventionism and boots on the ground; nations that fight terrorism and many other injustices selectively or nations that use nuclear weapons, we can ask if that brought the world closer to fairness, justice and peace or did it rather become a basis for hegemony.@@@What human value has the killing
of hundreds of thousands of Yemeni, Iraqi, Syrian and Afghan children served?@@@Were those not the evil faces of the total lack of justice and fairness in many parts of the world?@@@And in reality, what is it that the Islamic Republic of Iran seeks that has caused havoc and chaos among the oppressors of the world?@@@Is it not the exercise of its own logical and just right?@@@A willingness to support hegemony has become a sore point for humankind around the world and poses a serious threat.@@@Increasingly, nations around the world wish to achieve justice and independence while also enjoying security.@@@The realization of the doctrine of resistance shows how sincerely and deeply many people wish to achieve true justice, while unilateralism has been used to hold many countries back on a selective basis.@@@The United States cannot accept that certain countries have the right to stand on their own two feet, and it continues to confuse militarism with security.@@@The situation of America’s allies is no better.@@@What is occurring today in Europe is a mirror image of what has occurred in Western Asia over the past few decades.@@@The conduct and the result of moving troops throughout those regions have yielded the same results, and the fate of many countries has shown that America has pursued its own interests at the expense of many others.@@@The Islamic revolution in Iran was the beginning of the push of the great nation of Iran to seek its own place in the world.@@@For decades we have confronted foreign plots such as coups d’etat, oppressive sanctions and hegemonic interventions.@@@None of Iran’s successes have been acceptable to the great Powers.@@@Some 40 years ago, the late President of the Islamic revolution Mohammad-Ali Rajai placed his feet, whose soles had been savagely tortured, upon a rostrum in the Security Council Chamber and showed the scars of the torture he had been subjected to at the hands of the Shah’s secret police (see S/PV.2251 (1980)).@@@He was later martyred by the hypocrites.@@@A decade later, the late Imam Khomeini ensured that Iran was able to repel foreign aggression against its territory and take charge of its own destiny.@@@The people of Iran who were themselves victims of terrorism have today become supporters who can be counted on in the fight against terrorism throughout the region.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran has spent much capital to achieve its objectives — from the time when Saddam Hussein tore up the Algiers Agreement and attacked our country unprovoked, to the time when the American Government trampled on the nuclear agreement and, we saw a new phase of crimes committed against humankind.@@@Some time ago, the former President of the United States announced that it was the United States that created Da’esh.@@@For us, it makes no difference which American Administration created Da’esh.@@@What matters is that a Government on the other side of the planet decided to bring havoc and chaos to our region at the expense of the lives and blood of women and children and innocents.@@@Nonetheless, the Islamic Republic resistance put an end to that destructive movement.@@@And the leader who emerged in the fight against terrorism was none other than our beloved late martyr Qasem Soleimani — a seeker after freedom who became a martyr on the path to obtaining freedom for the nations of our region.@@@And the previous President of the United States of America effectively signed off on that savage, illegal and immoral crime.@@@What he said essentially showed that the oppression that was imposed on the nations of the region had managed to heal some of the hearts that were broken by that crime.@@@We will not waver in our pursuit of justice in the face of the crime that the American President admitted to having signed off on.@@@We will pursue justice through a fair tribunal for those who martyred our beloved General Qasem Soleimani.@@@The history of Iran is the history of a nation that has learned to stand on its own two feet and not to depend on anyone else.@@@Iran learned that lesson when in both world wars it declared its neutrality, yet in both wars was subject to foreign occupation.@@@Afterwards, when it approached the United States in the 1950s and relied on it to achieve Iran’s dream of nationalizing its oil industry, it was betrayed again.@@@Even the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed and accepted in the framework of the Security Council, was unilaterally trampled on.@@@Iran has learned the policy of resistance and progress, which it has focused on pursuing because of an advanced and logical social order through which the Islamic Republic of Iran today, despite the oppressive sanctions imposed on it, has become a strong country and has achieved many impressive goals in the fields of technology, know-how and expertise.@@@We believe that the world today needs a strong Iran that is able to export other products in addition to oil and gas.@@@We have distribution networks throughout our vast nation in electricity, knowledge-seeking, biosciences, nanotechnology and nuclear sciences.@@@We are at the cutting edge, and Iran’s growth in those sectors is considerable.@@@A good example of our social endeavours was when we sought to bring universal health-care coverage to 85 million people, which showed that the pursuit of the will of the people is a foundation of the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@In contrast, during the times of the imposed war of Iraq against Iran, we were even prevented from being able to purchase barbed wire, but today we have been able to manufacture, through our own know-how and capabilities, the most modern systems to defend our nation.@@@Our enemies did not retreat, rather our nation managed to drive all of its enemies out of the arena by participating in an impressive and unprecedented fashion in the Islamic revolution in order to strengthen the values of faith and divine will, as well as the policy of good-neighbourly relations.@@@Progress in economic and trade relations have now been brought to the forefront of the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy.@@@We would like to have extensive relations with all nations throughout the world, particularly with our neighbours.@@@War is not the solution to crises.@@@Dialogue, conversations and negotiations are the true solutions.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a powerful country in the region, has a visible presence and is willing to solve crises.@@@During the past few years, Iran’s trade in its region increased at an impressive rate.@@@We have now entered with our neighbours into a new era of the expansion of friendly, neighbourly and brotherly ties, which brings stability and security to all sides.@@@During the hard times of our neighbouring countries, we showed that we were their true friends.@@@During the numerous conversations I have had with regional leaders, one of the main points raised was that regional security must be born from within and not from the outside.@@@The way to realize that is through collaboration and cooperation, not by forming opposing blocs.@@@We must rely on brotherly and friendly relations.@@@If we leave nations and the regions in charge of their own destinies, then the occupiers will leave and neighbours will remain supportive of one another in eternity.@@@In the not-too-distant past, we saw the fires of war burning between the two brotherly nations of Iraq and Iran, because of the encouragement of enemy Powers throughout the world.@@@Today we see the Arba’een pilgrimage in observation of the fortieth day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, which is celebrated in order to renew our faith in those values and to respect the descendants of the Prophet, who gave their lives for human dignity and human values.@@@I would like to direct the General Assembly’s attention to one of the most egregious points that shows the oppressive Powers present in the region.@@@The region has not previously had such an occupying Power as savage as the Zionist regime.@@@The killing of women and children is recorded in the dark report card of the Zionist regime, which has managed to build the biggest prison in the world in Gaza.@@@The illegal expansion of settlements and housing on Palestinian territories and farms and the killing of their children and their new generations shows everyone that seven decades of Israeli occupation and brutality are still with us and not coming to an end.@@@But the global Powers must show why they keep running away and evading the solutions proposed by the Islamic Republic of Iran to resolve the Palestinian crisis.@@@The entire Palestinian territory, from the mountains to the sea, needs only one solution — allowing the votes of all Palestinians, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in a comprehensive referendum.@@@The occupying Zionist Power, which has occupied Jerusalem and occupies other lands in the region, cannot be a partner for security and stability.@@@Allow me to draw Assembly members’ attention to another example of the lack of justice and fairness, namely, the double standards used when speaking of the nuclear science capacities of the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@And we all know that it is for only human and peaceful endeavours, but some countries are keen on portraying that as a threat in order to sweep under the rug what they should rightly face themselves, namely, denuclearization.@@@As the leader of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I announce that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking to build or obtain nuclear weapons, and such weapons have no place in our doctrine.@@@That has been issued as an official fatwa announced by His Eminence Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and a Sharia- based fatwa issued by His Eminence is worth more than any measures with any outside or international agencies.@@@All of this is taking place in an environment where countries that seek to portray us, unjustly, as a threat keep pursuing nuclear-weapon development and testing and have made a gift of those weapons of mass destruction to the Zionist Government.@@@In doing so, the Governments that must be disarmed are rewarded, but those that are observing proper frameworks are even threatened by measures under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@And despite the fact that it accounts for only 2 per cent of nuclear activities worldwide, Iran has been the subject of 35 per cent of nuclear inspections.@@@I therefore ask all those here today to please listen carefully to the following points.@@@First, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in good faith, accepted an agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2015 and lived up to all of its commitments, without exception, in the first phase, but the result was America trampling upon that agreement.@@@As they themselves said, in so many words, there were unprecedented oppressive sanctions measures imposed on the people of Iran as punishment for being freedom seekers.@@@A weapon of mass destruction — that is what sanctions are.@@@And abiding by, or cooperating in, the implementation of the same is helping oppression take root.@@@Secondly, it was America that trampled upon and left the agreement, not Iran.@@@The International Atomic Energy Agency issued 15 different reports stating specifically that Iran had fully complied with all of its commitments.@@@Thirdly, while we have paid the price for having lived up to our commitments, Iran has not been given the opportunity to reap the rewards and rights of the agreement, due to the United States, in cooperation with Europe, trampling upon that agreement.@@@We gave ample opportunities for those who trampled upon and left the agreement to return to it.@@@We have been extremely flexible, and had it not been for our flexibility, the negotiations would have stopped in the very first few days.@@@Iran’s logic of negotiations is a just analysis of what is going on, and our wish is only one thing — that commitments be honoured.@@@Guarantees, it seems, are simply things that might happen.@@@We are basing that on lived experience.@@@We are speaking of the experience of America having left the JCPOA.@@@And we negotiated with the current American Government for a year and a half for it to renew its commitment to return to the agreement and fulfil its provisions.@@@Today, even as the American Government speaks of honouring their commitments to this deal, it keeps repeating the same old stories of the past, which casts serious doubt on its true commitment to return to the agreement.@@@That brings us to another challenge.@@@Can we truly trust, without guarantees or assurances, that the American Government will live up to their commitment this time?@@@Of course, the Islamic Republic of Iran, with various well-established and vast relationships with countries across the globe, has managed in many cases to neutralize the sanctions and to create new opportunities.@@@The United States Government itself has announced many times through various Government officials that the maximum-pressure policy has suffered an embarrassing defeat.@@@We have found our path, independent of any agreement, and we will continue steadfastly on that path.@@@At the same time, while we are very earnest in the negotiations and have shown that if the rights of the people of Iran are respected, there is a great and serious will to resolve all issues, we believe that the knot of the nuclear deal must be loosened from the same place where they managed to tie it.@@@I will conclude by expressing the need felt around the world for justice and fairness.@@@Every single human being must be a part of actively building a new world based on justice and human values.@@@If we wish the new world to be acceptable, righteous, powerful and successful in resolving the challenges facing humankind, then it must be based in global fairness and justice.@@@That requires following several principles.@@@First, throughout the world, we must feel collectively responsible and determined to fight against oppression.@@@Secondly, we must respect the wishes and will of the people and of nations and must refrain from direct engagement in their internal affairs.@@@Thirdly, we must eliminate double standards.@@@Fourthly, we must stand up to violence and war.@@@Fifthly, international organizations must act independently and prudently.@@@Finally, and most important, we must create roles for dignified and qualified humans with experience so that they can create that new system.@@@Our views on the future horizon are very realistic.@@@On the basis of divine promises, as delivered by the prophets, we firmly believe that justice will envelop the world, and those who are true followers of divine commands will be blessed by the reappearance of the last messiah.@@@A year ago, I delivered my address at this very place as the President of a country of 38 million people (see A/76/PV.4).@@@Today I stand at this rostrum with the awareness that, according to various statistics, more than 40 million people — and, according to some voices, as many as 41 million people — are living in my country, Poland.@@@The additional 2 or 3 million people are predominantly refugees from Ukraine and are our neighbours.@@@Some of them are our permanent guests, while others travel between Poland and Ukraine.@@@However, there is one thing that they all have in common: they are sheltering in our country from war.@@@They are taking refuge in our country from death and from slavery under the Russian occupation after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.@@@The war has been continuing for seven months.@@@The war, provoked by Russian aggression, is a war in which Russia is not limiting itself to fighting the Ukrainian army.@@@Russian troops are killing civilians and forcibly relocating them to their territory.@@@Russia is destroying Ukrainian cities, monuments, schools, kindergartens and hospitals.@@@It destroys agricultural crops and devastates the environment in Ukraine.@@@It destroys literally everything that it cannot seize or loot.@@@Recently, it has been threatening not only Ukraine but the entire world with a nuclear catastrophe by attacking and causing the failure of nuclear power plants, particularly the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.@@@The decision to wage this horrible war was made in Russia by people prompted by an imperial sentiment and colonial, nationalist Russian hubris, exalting their own people and denying their sovereign neighbours the right to self-determination.@@@They managed to obsess the nation of one of the United Nations founding States with that thought — a nation that had a chance to protest against the insanity of its leaders.@@@Unfortunately, only a few Russian people, the most courageous, stood up against this war.@@@They dared to stand on the side of justice and honesty.@@@This war, started by Russia in Ukraine, like all other conflicts going on in the world today, must be lost by the aggressor.@@@Let me reiterate that, in this case, it is the Russian State.@@@Moreover, the aggressor has in a sense already lost because it failed to subdue a free nation, break the spirit of the Ukrainian nation and disperse the Ukrainian army.@@@Today it has against it not the Ukrainian State itself, but a nation of many millions of people, the vast majority of whom do not want any negotiations whatsoever with the invader until he withdraws his forces from the occupied lands of Ukraine.@@@It is at odds with a large part of the nations of the world, which have very clearly spoken their minds, including in resolutions adopted here at the United Nations.@@@It has against it my country, Poland, on which — and I say this here and now — Ukraine can always count.@@@I was one of those politicians who, even before the war, believed that Ukraine would successfully defend itself.@@@Today I am convinced that Ukraine will prevail, that the refugees will return to their homes, that Ukraine will be rebuilt and that its internationally recognized borders will be restored.@@@My country, Poland, joining forces with its allies, will do its utmost to make that happen.@@@But there are other facets to this war.@@@It has economic repercussions in many areas — a parallel war unleashed by Russia and the war against our common principles and values and against all humankind.@@@I also want to talk about that today because in this Hall I can see representatives of many familiar countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, with whose leaders I spoke just before or during the war.@@@This is not a regional conflict.@@@This war by Russia against Ukraine is fuelling a global fire.@@@This war will bear on our and their countries if that has not already happened.@@@One of the most dramatic global effects of the Russian aggression is the food crisis and the spectre of famine looming over large parts of the world.@@@I had lengthy discussions on the subject during my recent trip to countries of West Africa — Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal.@@@In all those countries, I spoke with their leaders about food security and the potential impacts of further restrictions on grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia.@@@The topic also featured in previous discussions that we had with fellow Presidents from Central and Eastern Europe and with leaders from Africa, the Middle East and Asia.@@@I also vividly recall a conversation that I had with the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, late at night in Rzeszow when he was on his way to Ukraine to discuss and address food-related problems.@@@I thank the Secretary-General for his energy, commitment, resolve and courage, which was, and is, much needed at this difficult time in order to represent the international community gathered in the largest organization in the world with dignity.@@@From the very beginning of the invasion, Russia has been deliberately and cynically destroying new crops and farming equipment, and the invasion itself has drastically reduced Ukrainian harvests.@@@The data that we obtained makes it clear: Russia has seized farmland representing 22 per cent of all agricultural land in Ukraine, that is, a fifth of the land that is the breadbasket of many non-European countries.@@@Land that produces nearly 30 per cent of winter crops has suddenly failed to produce any crops this season, or its harvest has been looted.@@@Speaking in this forum, I do not need to recall that Ukraine is one of the most important food producers in the world.@@@It is the breadbasket not only of Europe, but also the world.@@@Conservative estimates indicate that this year alone Ukraine’s harvest will be 35 per cent smaller in the aftermath of war, and I emphasize a 35 per cent smaller harvest in Ukraine.@@@More than one third of the breadbasket of large parts of the world has been eliminated by the Russian aggression.@@@Who will suffer from that?@@@It will be those who are most in need.@@@It is an economic weapon; it is the weaponization of food, hitting Africa and the Middle East the hardest.@@@I have been in politics long enough not to be naive in that regard.@@@This is a deliberate policy by Russia.@@@It is estimated that, in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger this year will increase by about 47 million people, again
especially in Africa and the Middle East.@@@It is there that this catastrophe of famine, provoked by Russia as a result of its aggression against Ukraine, will be most visible.@@@As the international community, we are obliged to prevent anyone in the twenty-first century from knowingly and cynically causing an artificial famine in the name of achieving their political goals, the way in which Stalin did back in the 1930s.@@@In that context, it is of key importance that, on 22 July in Istanbul, Russia and Ukraine signed separate agreements with Turkey and the United Nations.@@@Those documents are aimed at unblocking the sea route through the Black Sea for the export of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain.@@@Once again, I would like to personally acknowledge the significant role played by Secretary-General, Guterres in the conclusion of that accord.@@@That is a great success of the United Nations and the Secretary-General in this extremely difficult situation.@@@Now we all have to be vigilant about the parties’ compliance with the agreements and their commitments.@@@I am all the more concerned by the increasingly frequent statements from the Russian side undermining the accord, as well as by acts that deserve to be condemned in the strongest terms, such as the shelling of the Odesa seaport by the Russian army, which took place within less than 24 hours of the signing of the documents.@@@As the international community, we must immediately respond to such incidents by imposing further sanctions and providing more aid packages to Ukraine, which is defending itself.@@@For my part, I would like to affirm that, as a neighbour of Ukraine, Poland, together with its European Union partners, remains steadfastly committed to facilitating Ukrainian grain exports, including by land.@@@We will go to great lengths to make sure that those consignments reach those who are most in need, especially in Africa, Asia, Latin America and everywhere that it is needed, so that people can survive.@@@Given Russia’s unlawful actions, we should learn a lesson for the future.@@@We should also keep in mind the provisions of international law and the possibility of holding perpetrators accountable.@@@A number of regulations exist in international law on the protection of food resources and the natural environment during conflicts.@@@Inter alia, one can cite the provisions of article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, and by which States pledged to distribute the world’s food supplies equitably.@@@In addition, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, of 8 June 1977, in article 54, prohibits, among other things, attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs and agricultural areas.@@@In turn, article 55 of the Protocol obliges States to protect the natural environment from damage during hostilities.@@@That Russia is deliberately destroying Ukraine’s agriculture in breach of international law is probably no great surprise to anyone here.@@@But, in the face of a barbaric war, are international legal regulations a sufficient response to the enormity of the damage to the environment and the world’s food supply?@@@I have strong doubts about that.@@@In that context, I see the need to develop penalization mechanisms to be able in the future to bring to justice the perpetrators responsible for violating international law.@@@Those who knowingly destroy crops in the breadbasket of the world must know that they will be pursued in order to be prosecuted as long as they live.@@@From this rostrum, I would like to pledge our support for all existing and new initiatives so that those who deprive millions of people of their right to food and destroy the environment will no longer go unpunished.@@@Poland wants to actively participate in that work.@@@The Russian aggression on Ukraine constitutes no less than aggression against the whole world.@@@Every act of aggression requires a multidimensional international response, with determination and without hesitation.@@@It is necessary to step up pressure on Russia and its accomplice, Aleksandr Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus.@@@The advisability of continuing cooperation with those Governments should be deeply reassessed, including by international organizations.@@@There is no longer room for business as usual with Russia.@@@The time for business as usual has definitely come to an end and was finished by Russia through its bestial aggression against Ukraine, its violations of the principles of international law and a lack of respect for people and human lives.@@@I say that as a man who visited Kyiv on 23 February and who has been to Ukraine three times since the beginning of the war, right after the Russian
aggression, who saw damaged Borodyanka, near Kyiv, the destroyed houses and the suffering of the civilian population in Ukraine and who saw the repercussions of the brutal Russian aggression and blood on the street where Russian soldiers were shooting families driving in cars fleeing the war.@@@It is hard to imagine that, but I saw it with my own eyes.@@@I saw the enormity of their bestiality, and I know what the Russian aggression in Ukraine means and what it means when President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks about Russian brutality and the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians murdered by the Russians.@@@I say that here today before Member States during the General Assembly of the United Nations as the leader of a State whose borders have been crossed by almost 6 million Ukrainian refugees since the start of the Russian aggression.@@@Today our children go to school together with Ukrainian children, those Ukrainians who came to us, saving their lives by fleeing,
Our citizens took hundreds of thousands of refugees into their homes.@@@It is perhaps hard for many here to believe that, despite the fact that 6 million Ukrainian refugees came to our country and, according to our estimates, approximately 2 million are currently in Poland, we did not have to build a single refugee camp.@@@There was no such necessity.@@@No one is living in a tent in Poland.@@@Everyone found dignified accommodation in dignified conditions in homes and in places specifically prepared for them — hotels, boarding houses and other temporary locations.@@@There are no tent camps in Poland where people are living, sheltering themselves from war.@@@Everyone found dignified accommodation.@@@Every Polish man and every Polish woman is familiar with the situation in Ukraine.@@@Every Polish man and every Polish woman vividly remembers what Russian occupation means, what Russian invasion of a State means and what Russian terror means — because Polish families lived through that terror after the Second World War, when the Russians occupied Poland, when the country was behind the Iron Curtain, when patriots were trying to shake off the Russian yoke and were fighting and when many people were imprisoned and murdered.@@@In 1939, right after Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland, the country that invaded the Republic of Poland and destroyed my country, together with Nazi Germany, a Nazi State, on the basis of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, which was entered into on 23 August 1939, was precisely Soviet Russia.@@@It was Soviet Russia that occupied 50 per cent of my country and, at that time, nearly 2 million people were deported to the Far East and the depths of Siberia.@@@Twenty-two thousand Polish officers and policemen were brutally murdered by the Soviets.@@@They were shot down in Katyn, Mednoye, Kharkiv and Tver.@@@We know what Russian terror and Russian occupation mean.@@@That is why Poles went to help Ukrainian refugees without asking questions.@@@Neither the Government nor I, the President of Poland, had to call on them to do that.@@@We did not have to appeal to them.@@@People spontaneously went to the border in order to help and to take Ukrainians fleeing the Russian aggression to their homes.@@@That is the reality — the reality of Central Europe.@@@We must not forget those who are suffering.@@@Let us remember that six months of Russian aggression in Ukraine has brought about the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.@@@I appeal for an increase in aid to the Ukrainian civilian population, whose humanitarian needs are far greater than the funds currently being provided.@@@Winter is approaching, which, exacerbated by the war and energy prices, will be the hardest winter in years.@@@As humankind, we have no right to turn our backs on those most in need.@@@We, the international community, must not show any war fatigue.@@@We must help and support.@@@We should work together on such a road map for economic and social development to give people hope that the world can be a better and more supportive place in which to live despite being so scarred today by wars, the effects of pandemics and natural disasters.@@@Poland wants to jointly create such a programme, including here at the United Nations — for example, as part of the work of the Economic and Social Council.@@@Still, I owe a few words of truth to us — the leaders of the rich North, or, as others may like to put it, the West, including Western Europe.@@@It is very positive that we have risen to the challenge on the issue of Ukraine, that we have preserved our unity and rallied to support the victim, not the aggressor, and that Western Europe today can clearly distinguish between who attacked whom.@@@It knows that Russia is the aggressor and that Ukraine is suffering.@@@It is positive that there is a clear distinction.@@@But let us not become complacent.@@@My recent visit to Africa made me even more aware of something that I myself had previously thought about for a long time.@@@Were we equally resolute during the tragedies of Syria, Libya and Yemen?@@@Did we not return to business as
usual after the two tragedies of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the wars in the Horn of Africa?@@@While condemning the invasion of Ukraine, do we give equal weight to fighting mercenaries who seek to destabilize the Sahel and threaten many other States in Africa?@@@I think that the lesson learned from this war is the following.@@@If the United Nations is to truly be united, every response to violations of international law should be identical — decisive and principled — because the world is a system of communicating vessels.@@@Today the victim is Ukraine, but, if Russian imperialism succeeds, tomorrow it could be any country in the world and someone else will plunder someone else’s fields.@@@They will turn civilians out of doors and murder them.@@@We must not allow that to happen.@@@Poland’s position in the face of any war is clear and unambiguous.@@@We demand absolute respect for internationally recognized borders.@@@The inviolability of those borders is a fundamental element of the global order, and that is the precondition for peace in every single case.@@@Today Ukraine is the victim.@@@Tomorrow it may be any one of us unless we respect those iron-clad rules and do not compel that international law be respected.@@@There is no hiding the fact that Russia owes Ukraine war reparations, which it will have to pay.@@@There is no justice without reparations.@@@That applies to any country plundering another country.@@@It applies today, but it also applies to unsettled issues from the past.@@@I say that as the President of Poland, which was horrifically affected by the Second World War, a large part of it being ruined and destroyed, and which lost 6 million citizens, including 3 million Polish citizens of Jewish origin and nationality.@@@That is why Poland will not cease its efforts to hold Russia accountable for its violations of international law, both at the State level and individually.@@@This war must be resolved in such a way that the aggressor pays for the losses and damage caused.@@@It will pay for every murdered human being in Ukraine.@@@It will pay for every ruined house and every destroyed school building, plant and hospital.@@@That must happen.@@@Let us use all our powers and capabilities to ensure that the culprits are tried and punished.@@@We are already cooperating with the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice to find the most effective ways to identify and prosecute the perpetrators.@@@On many occasions in its history, the free world has faced partition wars, caused by enemies of freedom, driven by sick ambitions or the desire for total domination.@@@From the genocidaires of the most ancient times to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Pol Pot, the essence of such wars has not changed in any way.@@@It always begins with a cult of strength and a belief in one’s superiority, racial or ideological, over another human being, be it a person of another nationality from another country or sometimes from their own nation and country.@@@However, people have always pitched themselves against the aggressor and the genocidaire — free people.@@@Aggression stirs in people the will to resist, courage, fortitude, solidarity and the desire to support victims of injustice.@@@We therefore continue to exist as humankind.@@@I think that that is an obligation derived not only from the harsh laws of politics; it lies at the very foundation of human nature, for, as Pericles put it in his famous Athenian funeral oration: “Happiness is the fruit of freedom and freedom the fruit of valour.”@@@A person and nation can pay any price for freedom and fight for it to the very end.@@@People rebel against slavery, colonialism and oppression because it is their nature and law — the inalienable right of everyone to freedom and respect for their human dignity.@@@For months, Ukraine has been demonstrating almost unbelievable valour to us.@@@Therefore, in conclusion, from this rostrum I appeal to all those present the following.@@@Let us not be indifferent to the heroism and complete determination of the struggle for freedom.@@@Let us never show indifference to any nation that defends itself against tyranny and contempt for humankind, for, by doing so, it always defends all humankind against such tyranny and contempt.@@@The vision of a world in which only naked and brutal power wins is not only wrong and immoral, but it can also lead to a conflagration, engulfing the entire world.@@@I am convinced that it is no different on this occasion.@@@I say that in the forum of an organization that was formed in the wake of the greatest such conflagration following the Second World War.@@@It was not without reason that in 1945 the leaders of our countries, the founding members of the United Nations, declared their intent to build a world based on dialogue, opposing the use of naked and brutal force.@@@Let us not forget that legacy.@@@Let us not allow any tragedies such as those that the world experienced in the twentieth century happen in the future.@@@At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish you every success in fulfilling this great responsibility.@@@I would also like to sincerely congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, on his outstanding leadership and effective management of our work during the past session.@@@During a challenging time, characterized in particular by the coronavirus disease pandemic, his commendable initiatives enabled us to maintain hope for a better future.@@@I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and assure him of my country’s full support for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization in achieving
the goals we have set ourselves.@@@We encourage the Secretary-General in every regard, including in the implementation of the relevant provisions contained in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@Cote d’Ivoire welcomes the major successes that the United Nations has achieved in many areas since its founding.@@@In that context, my country would like to thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which declared the cessation of refugee status for Ivorian refugees on 30 June.@@@I take this opportunity to commend the excellent cooperation between UNHCR and my country.@@@Nevertheless, the multiple and complex challenges involving peace, security, democracy, the protection of human rights and the preservation of the environment remain matters of concern.@@@I welcome the relevance of the theme of this session, which calls on us to consider solutions to overcome the challenges before us.@@@The exacerbation of geopolitical tensions and the emergence of new international conflicts are endangering international peace and security.@@@The recent war in Ukraine has reminded us that peace is a perennial quest that we must pursue relentlessly.@@@The confrontation, which poses the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, continues to undermine world peace and plunge humankind into multiple crises.@@@It demonstrates to us once again the shortcomings of resorting to the military option in the resolution of conflicts.@@@That is why Cote d’Ivoire, which has always advocated for peaceful coexistence and the use of dialogue in the search for solutions to disputes among nations, renews its call for the immediate and definitive cessation of hostilities in Ukraine.@@@The war has serious economic, financial and social consequences for African countries.@@@Indeed, the rise in the price of oil and difficulties in supplying markets with cereals and fertilizers have led to widespread inflation, an increase in interest rates in international markets and a slowdown in world growth.@@@For several African countries, the conflict has therefore resulted in difficulties in financing their economies, an increase in the price of basic commodities and even famine-like conditions, owing to their dependence on grain and fertilizer from Ukraine and Russia.@@@That situation has led the Ivorian Government to subsidize the cost of petroleum products and wheat and temporarily cap the price of several staple foods in order to support households, particularly those in greatest need.@@@I welcome the signing of the agreement in Istanbul on 22 July on the export of wheat from Ukraine, brokered by the United Nations and Tiirkiye.@@@However, we regret that only 17 per cent of the wheat exported from Ukraine since that date has been earmarked for African countries.@@@Therefore, Cote d’Ivoire asks once again that priority be given to Africa in the implementation of the Istanbul agreement.@@@We also call on the international financial institutions and Africa’s development partners to urgently raise the necessary resources to support the most vulnerable countries so that they can deal with the multiple effects of the conflict in Ukraine.@@@United Nations peacekeeping operations are the tangible results of our collective efforts in the service of peace in countries affected by conflict.@@@Cote d’Ivoire, which hosted one of the largest United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, fully appreciates the sacrifices made by troop-contributing countries to enable the restoration of peace and facilitate postconflict reconstruction.@@@Based on the success of the United Nations Operation in Cote d’Ivoire and our faith in the values of the Charter of the United Nations, we have actively participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as I stated before the Security Council in December 2018 (see S/PV.8413).@@@In that regard, I am pleased that Cote d’Ivoire participates in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.@@@I commend the professionalism of the Ivorian contingents deployed in those peacekeeping operations.@@@I pay tribute to the memory of the Ivorian soldiers who died in the service of peace in the brotherly country of Mali, which requires the resolute commitment of all those at its side in its fight against armed terrorist groups.@@@Unfortunately, in the context of the fight against terrorism, 46 Ivorian soldiers, who are part of the eighth rotation of the national support element within MINUSMA, have been unjustly detained there since 10 July.@@@I once again call for their immediate release.@@@My country encourages the Malian authorities to focus their efforts on combating terrorism and resolutely implementing the various stages of the transition timetable and the political and institutional reforms, in view of the presidential elections scheduled
for February 2024, for the sake of the welfare of the Malian people.@@@Terrorism continues to pose a major threat to international peace and security and to represent an immense challenge that no country has succeeded in overcoming alone.@@@We therefore must strengthen our pooled resources to combat that scourge and demonstrate solidarity and determination.@@@In that regard, my country commends the decisive action taken by France and its European partners in the Sahel and reiterates its call for the greater involvement of the other major Powers in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea by supporting national armies, the Economic Community of West African States and the Accra initiative.@@@In order to contribute to that collective effort, Cote d’Ivoire has opened to African countries the International Counter- Terrorism Academy, which is based in the coastal town of Jacqueville and provides training in all civilian and military sectors involved in the fight against terrorism.@@@The current session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine has tended to compromise the progress made in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, particularly as a consequence of some industrialized countries’ return to the use of coal.@@@Unfortunately, time is running out, and we must act quickly and implement all of the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to meet the goal of maintaining global warming below 1.5°C.@@@In order to meet that goal, developed countries must drastically reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions and uphold their commitment to contributing $100 billion dollars a year to developing countries.@@@I am convinced that the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt, will provide a new opportunity to renew the political commitment of all stakeholders to contribute to financing the fight against global warming.@@@I would like to point out once again that my country will uphold its commitments under the Paris Agreement and is committed to protecting its forest heritage and rich biodiversity.@@@That is the raison d’etre of the Abidj an initiative—the Abidjan Legacy Programme — launched at the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which Cote d’Ivoire had the honour to host from 9 to 20 May.@@@I was delighted by the exceptional commitment and financial support of development partners for the Abidjan initiative, which very quickly garnered the resources necessary for its implementation, in the amount of more than $2.5 billion.@@@Today more than ever, humankind is at a turning point with regard to its future.@@@The threats facing our countries compel us to show greater solidarity, collaboration, justice and equity — the principles that underpin the multilateralism to which my country remains committed.@@@In the same spirit, Cote d’Ivoire calls for a thorough reform of the Security Council, in which Africa will be able take its rightful place.@@@I am Ferdinand Marcos, and I am President of the Republic of the Philippines.@@@I stand here today on behalf of 110 million Filipinos.@@@At this time of crisis and opportunity, I bring with me the spirit of their enduring commitment to the ideals of our United Nations.@@@That commitment is reflected in our solid contributions to the cause of peace and justice.@@@By shepherding through the Manila Declaration of 1982, we helped affirm that differences should be resolved only through peaceful means.@@@By reinforcing the predictability and stability of international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we provided an example of how States should resolve their differences, through reason and right.@@@Those two contributions provide useful guidance for our time, for amid challenging global tides, an important ballast is the stabilization of our common vessel, that is, our open, inclusive and rules-based international order, governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice.@@@As I have underscored, the Philippines will continue to be a friend to all and an enemy of none.@@@Our world order traces its roots to a moment 77 years ago.@@@The President of the General Assembly’s first predecessor from Asia, General Carlos Romulo, called on our leaders then to make this floor our last battlefield in order to determine in this Hall whether humankind was to survive or be wiped out in another holocaust.@@@Our peoples chose survival, cooperation and peace, and by doing so, they made history.@@@Today, history once again calls on us to make those choices.@@@We are confronted by tectonic shifts that will inform the ebb and flow of the coming century.@@@Of those, I see four challenges to the continued survival of our global community.@@@The first challenge is climate change.@@@The time for talk about if and when has long since passed — it is here and now.@@@Climate change is the greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples.@@@There is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort led by the United Nations.@@@The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice whereby those who are least responsible suffer the most.@@@The Philippines, for example, is a net carbon sink.@@@We absorb more carbon dioxide than we emit.@@@Yet we are the fourth most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change.@@@That injustice must be corrected and those who need to do more must act now.@@@We accept our share of responsibility and will continue to do our part to avert that collective disaster.@@@We call on industrialized countries to immediately fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions, provide climate financing and technology transfer for the adaptation of the most vulnerable and developing countries and lead by example.@@@We look forward to concrete outcomes at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to be held in Egypt later this year.@@@When future generations look back, let them not ask why we did not take this opportunity to turn the tide, or why we continued in our profligate ways until it was too late.@@@The threat knows no borders, no social class, nor any geopolitical consideration.@@@How we address it will be the true test of our time.@@@Secondly, the development of advanced technologies is rapidly transforming human life and experience.@@@We still barely understand how those transformations are unfolding and where they are leading.@@@The imminent diffusion of those emerging technologies could solve many of our old problems, but could also disrupt our political and social orders.@@@Our governance structures must keep up.@@@Thirdly, widening geopolitical polarities and sharpening strategic competitions are transforming the international political landscape.@@@A profound lack of trust is putting enormous strains on our multilateral system.@@@The Charter of the United Nations itself is being violated around the world as we speak.@@@In Asia, our hard- won peace and stability is under threat from increasing strategic and ideological tensions.@@@They demand that we uphold the ideals that led to the establishment of this parliament of nations and reject any attempt to deny or redefine our common understanding of those principles.@@@Even as we grapple with those new long-term shifts, we remain beset by an unresolved problem, the inequalities and inequities that persist within and among countries, and that continue to demand urgent action.@@@Therein lies our fourth transcendent challenge.@@@That injustice was evident during the pandemic, when the richer nations immediately received vaccines at the expense of the have-nots.@@@We see, for example, similar dangers lurking in the persistent digital divide and in ballooning debt burdens.@@@As we awaken from the economic stupor caused by the pandemic, we must reinvigorate the world economy.@@@We must use public and private resources to encourage the expansion of trade, investment and technology transfers to accelerate development.@@@Knowledge and intellectual gains must flow freely to allow those lagging behind to catch up.@@@Sustainable development will be hampered to the detriment of all if existing structures in the global economy remain unreformed.@@@In the past three decades, Filipinos have made significant strides on their path to sustainable development.@@@Despite the challenges of the pandemic and global economic upheavals, we remain on track to reach upper-middle-income status by next year.@@@With steady investment in food, public health, education and other social services, we expect to become a moderately prosperous country by 2040.@@@I am confident that we will achieve that vision.@@@Yet no nation stands alone.@@@The achievement of our national ambition requires a global environment that creates conditions that allow all nations, including ours, to thrive in peace.@@@We need the United Nations to continue to work and we in the Philippines are determined to be part of that solution.@@@The Philippines did not hesitate to donate to the COVID-19@@@Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility that helped provide vaccines in many parts of the developing world.@@@Multilateralism and international cooperation do make a difference.@@@Filipino health workers were on the front lines in many countries to curb the spread of the virus, risking and often sacrificing their own lives to save those of others.@@@We have always been an optimistic and courageous nation.@@@Despite the enormity of those challenges, we believe that solutions are within our collective grasp.@@@The President of the Assembly has already identified the three tools at our disposal.@@@The first of those tools is solidarity.@@@We need to reaffirm the wisdom of the founders of our United Nations.@@@That means transcending our differences and committing to ending war, upholding justice, respecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security.@@@Nuclear weapons continue to pose an existential threat, despite our efforts to build norms that resoundingly prohibit them.@@@We must reject the notion of deterrence and remain committed to decreasing the global stockpile of those weapons.@@@At the same time, we must also address the scourge of the proliferation of all weapons, be they small arms, light weapons or improvised explosive devices.@@@Our work must also focus on ensuring that the international system remains fair, not only for all States but more importantly for all peoples.@@@The system must work for the most vulnerable, especially the marginalized, including migrants and refugees.@@@The world has witnessed the enduring contribution of migrants in the fight against the pandemic.@@@We are still dreaming of an end to the disturbing incidents of racism, of Asian hate and of all prejudice.@@@The Philippines’ joint programme on human rights with the United Nations is an example of a constructive approach that puts our people rather than our politics at the centre of that work.@@@It provides a model for revitalizing the structures that facilitate solidarity between the United Nations and a sovereign duty- bearer.@@@Our continued solidarity will also benefit from a reformed and more inclusive Security Council and an empowered General Assembly that can hold the Council to account.@@@At the same time, the United Nations must forge ahead with its flagship tradition of global peacekeeping.@@@My country’s experiences in building peace and forging new paths of cooperation can enrich the work of the Security Council.@@@To that end, I appeal for the valuable support of all Member States for the Philippines’ candidature for the Security Council for the 2027-2028 term.@@@Our success in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao in the south of the Philippines is the centrepiece of those efforts.@@@The peace that we have forged after many decades of conflict among warring factions and clansmen demonstrates that unity is possible even in the most trying circumstances.@@@Inclusive dialogue involving all stakeholders, including women, young people, faith leaders and civil society, conducted with patience and in good faith, has produced a credible and solid foundation for self-governance that will pave the way for lasting peace and sustainable development.@@@We take the same approach in Asia.@@@The Philippines builds partnerships for peace and development through dialogue, including interfaith and interreligious dialogue, especially through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.@@@In the face of great diversity, we believe that partnerships form the bridge that will unite us all in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.@@@Our global community is only as strong as we make it.@@@We have to ensure that all nations, especially developing countries, are equipped with the tools
they need to navigate the uncharted waters of this century.@@@That requires a transformative development agenda.@@@We therefore welcome the convening of a United Nations summit of the future next year as an opportunity to collectively roll up our sleeves and chart our common path.@@@The second of those tools is sustainability.@@@We must seek solutions that preserve our plane, solutions that must transcend our time and win the future for succeeding generations.@@@We crafted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a platform of unity where our societies can build a future that is resilient and inclusive and where our people can be healthy, happy and secure.@@@That requires investment in food security, the fragility of which has been clearly demonstrated by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.@@@We need to take concrete steps towards a modern and resilient agriculture.@@@Food is not just a trade commodity or a livelihood, it is an existential imperative as well as a moral one.@@@It is the very basis of human security.@@@In order to attain food self-sufficiency and security, we are providing innovative solutions and financial support to farmers and fisherfolk to adapt new technologies and connect to national and global value supply chains.@@@We look forward to forging cooperation with the United Nations and our partners to boost agricultural productivity and food security.@@@As host to 17 United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, the Philippines strongly supports reforms to ensure that the United Nations development system delivers as one through its United Nations country team.@@@Water connects our world and sustains our existence, but it is also a finite resource that requires our stewardship.@@@Our biodiversity is equally important and must be protected amid the continuing challenge of climate change.@@@We must enhance our cooperation in those areas, but sustainability also requires development policies that go beyond traditional metrics.@@@We already know that gross domestic product is an incomplete measure of progress and that vulnerability is multidimensional.@@@Our development agenda must also take into account the interests of all developing nations, including middle-income countries, where the majority of the world’s poor live.@@@At the same time, sustainability means equipping our people with the tools they need to meet the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.@@@Investments in education are key, and my Administration is prepared to make such investments.@@@The Philippines notes with appreciation the Transforming Education Summit held earlier this week, at which those subjects were taken up.@@@There is perhaps no greater renewable resource than the creativity and innovation of our young people.@@@We understand the value of harnessing our people’s talents by creating a robust and creative economy, and we will continue to work with partners in promoting that at the international level.@@@The third and final tool is science.@@@Knowledge and discovery remain the keys to unlocking the potential of our dynamic future.@@@Encouraging our young people’s curiosity, honing their skills and protecting their intellectual property are important investments.@@@Humankind is expanding its horizons, both in the digital world and out in our physical universe.@@@Access to those domains is an inalienable right of all nations, as is the peaceful use of all existing and emerging technologies.@@@The Philippines is preparing for the future by laying a governance framework that will enable us to harness the power of renewable energy, develop the capacity to utilize life sciences such as medicine and virology, pursue digital solutions towards a more modern economy and expand our presence in outer space.@@@But we also need to update the global structures that facilitate international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, biology and chemistry, to name but a few.@@@At the same time, we need new structures to govern rapid advances in other areas.@@@We need to start by defining the norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace and outer space and forming legal rules that will prevent the weaponization of artificial intelligence.@@@The diffusion of cutting-edge technology across the economy is promising, but it could come at a cost.@@@Our development agenda must consider the possible displacement of human labour as a result of advances in automation.@@@We must prepare our economic structures for that.@@@We should start building the necessary supports for the sectors affected.@@@The transcendent challenges of our time are as consequential as those that faced us 77 years ago when we founded this body.@@@We are indeed at a watershed moment, one that requires a refounding of this our United Nations.@@@The world is ready for transformation.@@@It is up to us, as leaders of our nations, to move and shape that transformation.@@@The future beckons, and we can embark on that journey as single nations or as a world in harmony.@@@I say, let the challenges of one people be the challenges for all nations.@@@In that way the success of one will be a success for us all.@@@The peoples of the world look to their leaders, to us, to make these aspirations for our future a reality.@@@We must not fail them.@@@And if we stand together, we will not fail them.@@@If we stand together, we can only succeed.@@@Let us dream, let us work for those successes for all our nations, united.@@@Exactly two years ago, during the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, we were in the first year of the pandemic.@@@It was a year replete with uncertainty and fear, owing to the unexpected outbreak of a virus, the historic aftermath of which, even today, continues to affect us in terms of loss of life, serious health ramifications for our populations and damage to our economies.@@@Since then, the international situation has not only failed to improve, but new sources of tension have emerged that have made it difficult to make progress in economic recovery and in addressing the significant social costs of the pandemic.@@@The military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is unjustifiable.@@@Our country has condemned it in the strongest terms as a clear violation of the principles on which we have built the Organization and that must be respected by all its members.@@@It is imperative that the Russian Federation cease hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine as soon as possible.@@@The parties to the conflict must work towards returning to the negotiating table to resolve their differences peacefully, as set out under the Charter of the United Nations.@@@In the meantime, the negative effects of the armed conflict are being felt in many spheres at the international level and are increasingly weighing on the daily lives of millions of people.@@@The impact on international trade is fuelling recessionary trends in many countries.@@@The shortage of agricultural products is seriously affecting least-developed importer countries, and the lack of access to world markets is leading to food insecurity in several regions of the world.@@@Other countries are experiencing energy shortages or higher energy prices, which is having an impact on the living conditions of millions of people.@@@At the same time, it has also created a new environmental threat.@@@Although its outcome did not meet everyone’s expectations, the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), held in Glasgow, in November 2021, saw the achievement of several promising results.@@@Furthermore, it was clear that countries have not given up on the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.@@@The discussions at COP26, in Glasgow, will allow for further debate in other contexts in the near future.@@@We hope that the high level of ambition will be maintained by all countries and that the promise to muster the financial resources necessary to support adaptation and mitigation measures against climate change will be kept.@@@Otherwise, the international community will have missed another opportunity — perhaps its last — to address one of the greatest threats facing it.@@@If we fail in that work, future generations will be justified in saying that we, who governed during this century, did not live up to shouldering our political responsibilities.@@@In that regard, I would like to renew Uruguay’s support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and our firm commitment to achieving its objectives and its concrete targets.@@@That is the shared goal that we have set for ourselves, and we must make a greater effort to achieve it.@@@In that context, as we face such significant challenges, “multilateralism” is not a hollow or meaningless word.@@@It is therefore essential to strengthen the multilateral system, to which we all belong and which constitutes a common asset.@@@International and regional mechanisms must be strengthened and improved to make them more effective and preventive.@@@The international community is today facing three major challenges: international peace and security; the environment; and global health.@@@The multilateral system is essential to addressing those challenges, not only as an inspirational principle, but also as a key tool for making our work effective.@@@In that regard, I would like to reaffirm once again our commitment to multilateralism.@@@Despite the interconnected shocks of2022, this year should also be seen as a milestone for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@We are already living in the decade of action, and it remains imperative that we translate words into the realization of the Goals.@@@To that end, Uruguay submitted its fifth voluntary national review on the achievements and targets met by our country in 2021.@@@The reviews clearly reaffirm my country’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to achieving the SDGs.@@@Uruguay is sparing no effort to create proactive public policies and improve the relevant indicators.@@@Within the international system, there are persistent shortcomings that affect and weaken the work that has been done in pursuit of our countries’ economic and social development.@@@Many times, the need to establish certain criteria in order to ensure international cooperation results in adverse, undesired and extremely negative outcomes.@@@Many countries, including Uruguay, have been adversely affected by the archaic concept of development based on per capita income and resulting in a graduation process that, in practice, constitutes a punishment for countries on the path to development that have achieved a better redistribution of income.@@@States shoulder the primary responsibility to protect the human rights of their populations.@@@We are deeply shocked to see that, in many parts of the world, the basic rights of millions of men, women and children are being flagrantly violated, which is made even worse when the perpetrators of such atrocities are their people’s own rulers, who misuse repressive mechanisms and violate their international obligations in this domain.@@@That reality is all the more difficult to bear and disturbing, as we have such examples in our own region of Latin America and the Caribbean.@@@There is no more appropriate forum than the General Assembly in which to reaffirm Uruguay’s humanist and humanitarian vocation and reiterate its continued and permanent commitment to the human rights agenda, while demanding that the international commitments undertaken by the members of the Organization be fully respected by all actors of the international community.@@@Similarly, we must ensure that efforts to address such sensitive issues in the relevant multilateral forums are carried out in an objective and non-politicized manner.@@@In that regard, I would like to underscore Uruguay’s firm commitment to strengthening mechanisms dedicated to the protection of the rights of women, children, adolescents, the elderly, migrants, persons with disabilities and the members of the LGBTI community.@@@Migratory waves resulting from wars, internal conflicts and political and economic crises of various magnitudes have increased in recent years.@@@Hotspots of regional instability, such as those resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, the civil war in Syria and events in Libya, Myanmar and Venezuela — in our own region — have caused an increase in the flow of people and families fleeing their homes and countries in search of security and relief.@@@I would like to highlight the role of the International Criminal Court as a central mechanism of the international justice system and its relevance as a deterrent and means of punishment for the perpetrators of acts of genocide, mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.@@@With regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, and as it does every year, Uruguay renews its support for United Nations peacekeeping missions and operations.@@@Our country has a long history of contributing to those missions, which began in the late 1940s, and has continuously deployed troops in various missions for more than 70 years.@@@Uruguay was among the first 15 troop contributors to the United Nations system, and our main troop deployments are currently in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights.@@@Uruguay is unwavering in its commitment to peace, international security and the protection of civilians.@@@In line with the spirit and provisions of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Uruguay officially submitted its national action plan on women and peace and security on 21 July.@@@Uruguay is one of the founding countries of the Organization and throughout its history has worked collaboratively to meet its goal of maintaining international peace and security.@@@Uruguay does not believe that peace is possible in the world without the firm and serious commitment of the international community in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation.@@@The impasse and paralysis recently experienced in in the framework of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must make us reflect upon this particular moment in the history of the United Nations.@@@Uruguay has supported and will continue to support the United Nations disarmament agenda.@@@It will therefore continue to tirelessly seek agreements to enable the disarmament architecture to function effectively and reliably.@@@Among the current factors responsible for insecurity at the international level, we must recall the growing influence of international organized crime, drug trafficking and international terrorism.@@@As my country’s Government has made combating crime and drug trafficking one of its priorities in order to provide its citizens with a greater level of security, I reiterate Uruguay’s firm commitment to and cooperation in the fight against organized crime and terrorist activities at the regional and international levels.@@@Uruguay is committed to the cybersecurity agenda and combating cybercrime.@@@The Organization shoulders a major responsibility in that area, and Uruguay actively participates in the relevant activities under way.@@@In addition, Uruguay has formalized its request to the Council of Europe to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention, and thereby is ready to embrace the most modern legislation available to deal with cybercrime.@@@As we all know, the various activities of the Organization are numerous, timely and necessary, but as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has rightly said, we must combat the dysfunctionality that paralyses us.@@@As leaders, we have an obligation to ensure that the Organization represents all citizens, including the voiceless and faceless, and is not perceived as an annual display of rhetoric for representatives and diplomats.@@@Democracy is not a perfect model and does not resolve all the world’s problems, but it is clearly the system of Government that best safeguards people’s greatest aspiration — their freedom.@@@Democracy is the form of Government that uniquely represents and reflects the human condition itself, our expectations of spiritual and material betterment and the enjoyment of the right to choose.@@@Democracy and the rule of law are necessarily interdependent elements and essential for ensuring that the social and political order of a country represents the genuine will of its citizens.@@@However, democracy and its principles and values are systematically under attack in many parts of the world.@@@For Uruguay, the democratic system is part of its history and its best traditions.@@@It is an identifying feature of our society.@@@We are proud to be considered as a full-fledged democracy, but we are also aware of our responsibility as leaders to strengthen it every day and protect it from the many challenges it faces.@@@That democratic edifice, together with its values and guiding principles — our democracy and our rule of law — have enabled Uruguay’s voice to be not only heard but also respected in the international community.@@@Those were, are and will remain the fundamental pillars on which my country’s contribution to the international order rests.@@@On that basis, Uruguay renews its commitment to the international system of nations.@@@In 1945, representatives from 51 countries met in San Francisco to found the United Nations.@@@They made a commitment to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations and “save succeeding generations the scourge of war”.@@@Seventy-seven years later, we have still not achieved those goals.@@@Around the world, many children, and even many adults, have never known peace.@@@In Europe today we are confronted with the unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in flagrant violation of international law, in particular the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It is a war with devastating effects for the Ukrainian people, brutally affecting the civilian population.@@@The gravity of the acts committed makes an independent, impartial and transparent investigation imperative so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished.@@@Therefore, we cannot fail to once again condemn the Russian aggression and emphasize Portugal’s support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.@@@Russia must cease hostilities and allow for a serious and sustained dialogue towards a ceasefire and peace.@@@This is not the time for Russia to escalate the conflict or to make irresponsible threats to resort to nuclear weapons.@@@We welcome the efforts of the entire United Nations system, in particular its Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, to resolve the conflict and to mitigate its damaging effects, such as the food crisis.@@@It has once again been the most vulnerable who have felt the impact of the energy and food crisis the most, after being buffeted by almost three years of the pandemic.@@@That is why we reiterate our solidarity with all those around the world, particularly in Africa, who are suffering from the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.@@@That is also why it is important to make it clear and unequivocal that the necessary sanctions applied to Russia cannot affect, directly or indirectly, the production, transportation and payment of cereals and fertilizers.@@@Peace was not definitively won in 1945, but the world has changed radically since then.@@@We need a representative, agile and functioning Security Council that is able to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century without becoming paralysed, and whose actions are scrutinized by the other Members of the United Nations.@@@We need a Security Council that incorporates a comprehensive view of security, recognizing, inter alia, the role of climate change as an accelerator of conflict — a Security Council where the African continent, and at least Brazil and India, have seats and where small countries are more fairly represented.@@@A global vision of security is essential, based on the New Agenda for Peace advocated by Secretary-General Guterres — an agenda focused on conflict prevention and capable of ensuring adequate, predictable and sustainable funding for peacebuilding.@@@As the international community, it is our duty to support the efforts of African nations for the stability of their continent, seeking African solutions to African problems.@@@The worsening security and humanitarian context in the Sahel also requires a concerted and multidimensional effort, ensuring humanitarian assistance to populations affected by the multiple crises that plague the region.@@@The evolving terrorist threat around the world, particularly in Mozambique, the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea, requires a targeted and effective response from the international community.@@@Over the past decades, my country has established itself as a reliable partner for global peace and stability.@@@At the service of the United Nations, we are currently present in four theatres of peacekeeping operations, including in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.@@@I am very proud of the recognition that our military and security forces have received for their contribution to crisis and conflict management on all continents under the aegis of the United Nations, NATO or the European Union.@@@It is undeniable that there is a link between climate and security.@@@Today more than ever, we are feeling the effects of climate change — heat waves or intense cold, droughts, fires, floods and storms.@@@Countries, such as Portugal, that suffer from coastal erosion, increased droughts and the tragedy of forest fires clearly understand the urgency of climate action.@@@Neither is it necessary to explain it to countries like Pakistan, which today is suffering the truly devastating consequences of the rest of the world’s climate inaction, or to coastal countries, particularly small island nations, which see their livelihoods threatened year after year by rising sea waters.@@@We hope that the twenty-seventh Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, can be a time that leads to an inclusive transition, ensuring a more balanced allocation of climate financing between mitigation and adaptation.@@@Portugal has been at the forefront of the decarbonization process, having been the first to commit to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as early as the twenty-second Conference of the States Parties to the UNFCCC, held in Marrakesh.@@@We believe that that goal is feasible from an economic and technological point of view and will promote employment and generate social justice.@@@We will seek to accelerate those commitments, as we already did with our goal of ending electricity production from coal, which we achieved last year.@@@By 2026, we want to increase the percentage of renewables in the electricity consumed in Portugal from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.@@@To that end, we will continue our strong investment in solar, wind and ocean energies, and we will invest in the use of renewable gases, such as green hydrogen.@@@The President took the Chair.@@@The sea is one of the platforms where climate is projected.@@@We welcome the active participation of all States in the second Ocean Conference, which we had the honour of co-organizing with Kenya.@@@The Lisbon Declaration represents a genuine action plan for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 14, on the conservation and sustainable use of ocean resources.@@@As part of the commitments made by the various countries and entities present, Portugal also reiterated its commitment to protecting at least 30 per cent of
marine areas by 2030.@@@We went further; by the end of the decade, we want 100 per cent of the maritime space under Portuguese sovereignty or jurisdiction to be assessed as being in a good environmental status.@@@After Lisbon, there remains much work to be done on the ocean agenda.@@@I am sure that France and Costa Rica will continue the work undertaken by Portugal and Kenya in recent years with redoubled energy.@@@We therefore call for the conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 global biodiversity framework that enshrines the 30-by-30 target.@@@We also support progress in the negotiations of the treaty on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions by the end of this year.@@@The transition to a prosperous future — a green and digital future — can leave no one behind.@@@Social policies must be at the heart of our action, the development of our economies and the fight against climate change.@@@We therefore support the preparatory process for the Social Summit, proposed by the Secretary-General.@@@We must also continue to work to ensure effective and equitable immunization worldwide, improve the global health architecture and find ways to respond more quickly, in a coordinated and decisive manner, to future crises by adopting a genuine pandemic treaty.@@@The successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development plays mainly on the most vulnerable countries and populations.@@@All those challenges further highlight the universal, indivisible and independent nature of all human rights, whose respect, protection and promotion are a top priority of Portugal’s external and internal action.@@@Imbued with the humanist spirit that our historical responsibility as forerunners of the abolition of the death penalty instils in us, we will continue to fight for its universal abolition.@@@No future will be truly transformative without pluralist, inclusive societies that promote gender equality and combat racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and all forms of intolerance.@@@In that regard, the fight for gender equality and women’s empowerment is absolutely crucial.@@@If we do not achieve that, it will not be possible to meet our human rights obligations or the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@It is also crucial that we pay particular attention to the impact of conflict situations on the rights of women and girls and the fundamental role that they can play in processes to build and consolidate peace.@@@I therefore want to reiterate Portugal’s support for the United Nations women and peace and security agenda.@@@As a country of emigration and immigration, we will continue to participate constructively in discussions on the global governance of migration.@@@We will continue the good path that we have been following in our national territory, from the integration of migrants to the promotion of regular pathways for labour mobility.@@@We have played an active role in welcoming migrants and refugees in a clear expression of solidarity, having welcomed refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan, among other places.@@@The transformative potential of the United Nations is immense, but it must be given the tools to realize the high expectations placed on it by people around the world, particularly young people.@@@One third of the world’s population is under 20 years old.@@@It is therefore essential to ensure that young people participate in decision-making processes and that their voices be effectively heard.@@@We will therefore continue to take a leading role in the youth agenda and support the work of the United Nations Youth Office.@@@The United Nations is the global forum for consultation among peoples.@@@The challenges that we face today require that we continue to adapt our common home, making it more efficient, fairer and more representative.@@@Portugal is ready to make its contribution.@@@We are therefore candidates to the Security Council for the two-year term from 2027 to 2028.@@@We once again hope to merit the trust of Member States, because only together can we build a more peaceful, more sustainable, more inclusive and more prosperous future.@@@The strengthening of multilateralism is not an option.@@@It is an absolute necessity in order to deal with global challenges.@@@Today it is time to move from words to action, with more cooperation, more solidarity and more multilateralism.@@@Portugal, as always, will not miss that call.@@@I am highly honoured to participate in this seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, who, for agenda reasons, cannot be present.@@@I would like to congratulate Your Excellency, Ambassador Csaba Korosi, upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its current session.@@@I wish you great success in your mission.@@@Let me also commend the work done by your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid.@@@Under his presidency, we strengthened multilateral mechanisms in support of Member States to address global challenges such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) .@@@To His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres go our words of appreciation for the wise manner in which he has led the work of our Organization.@@@Allow me also, on behalf of the Mozambican people, to thank all United Nations Member States for the support that contributed to the election of Mozambique as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2023-2024.@@@We acknowledge that election with a great sense of responsibility.@@@Based on the motto of our candidacy, “International peace and security and sustainable development”, we will advocate for dialogue, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the promotion of peace, the fight against terrorism and the role of multilateralism as an important tool to address the challenges facing the world.@@@The theme of the current session of the General Assembly reveals that the world is living through adverse and challenging times, characterized by a multiplicity of interlinked crises.@@@Among those, we can highlight COVID-19, climate change and humanitarian crises, with their negative effects on the global economy.@@@The emergence of new outbreaks of internal tensions and inter-State conflicts, terrorism and international organized crime is negatively affecting the economic and social development of our countries.@@@These are aggravating the food, energy and humanitarian crises and hampering the functioning of the supply chain in international markets.@@@That is why Mozambique advocates for the need for constructive dialogue and concerted multilateral action, which are the only avenues for the preservation of peace and the continued promotion of the sustainable development of our countries.@@@For Mozambique, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will guide us in the search for collective solutions to the problems of this era of change, which is also the theme of this session.@@@In our own experience, the incorporation of the SDGs into the priorities and pillars of our governance programme has had significant positive results for household incomes and the fight against poverty; agricultural productivity and the development of the entire value chain; the supply of drinking water to the population, in particular in rural areas; the number of people with access to electricity; enrolment in primary, secondary, technical-professional and higher education schools; the rates of access and retention of girls in school, particularly in rural areas; and primary health care and vaccination programmes for children, as well as maternal and child health care.@@@Equally noteworthy is the expansion of services in the administration of justice, ensuring improved access to justice for citizens.@@@We have also been promoting actions in the area of the blue economy, as well as in the protection and conservation of the environment and ecosystems.@@@However, our experience also shows that we need to rethink the multilateral institutional financing model, which will allow more resources to be mobilized to complement internal efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In the context of the prevention and combat of COVID-19, the Government of Mozambique has adopted a set of measures to contain the spread of the pandemic in order to ensure a balance between saving human lives and keeping the economy running.@@@Among these measures, we have undertaken massive vaccination campaigns against the disease; 96.6 per cent of Mozambican citizens over 18 years of age have been vaccinated to date.@@@Each of our countries has lessons to draw from the fight against and prevention of COVID-19.@@@I highlight the need for national health systems to be prepared to respond to health crises, which requires the provision of and universal access to medical equipment and the means necessary for prevention and treatment; funding to effectively respond to public health emergencies; the strengthening of education and the training of health professionals; the strengthening of bilateral and multilateral cooperation; and greater interaction and dialogue between public and private actors, to respond more effectively to crises with global impact.@@@Climate change has made Mozambique permanently vigilant.@@@In recent times, our country has been cyclically and intensively affected by depressions, tropical cyclones, rains and strong winds, floods and droughts that have caused the loss of human life, the displacement of persons and extensive damage to infrastructure and socioeconomic activities.@@@Between 2019 and 2022 alone, Mozambique was hit by Cyclones Idai, Kenneth, Guambe, Chalane, Ana and Gombe.@@@In order to respond to challenges related to the reduction and risk management of natural disasters, in 2021 Mozambique, in coordination with the countries of southern Africa and cooperation partners, established, in Nacala-Porto, in the north of the country, the Humanitarian and Emergency Operations Centre of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).@@@The Centre is aimed at providing SADC countries with tools and institutions capable of responding to and mitigating the impacts of climate change and other emergencies requiring rapid, coordinated and timely intervention in any member State.@@@Mozambique is committed to continuing to strengthen climate security, including through advocacy and the dissemination of good environmental protection practices, management and risk reduction of natural disasters.@@@These actions reinforce the role that His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, has been playing in his capacity as the African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management in Africa.@@@In that vein, we call on the international community to join in our efforts so that we can continue to build resilience and adaptation capacity to address the effects of climate change, in line with the commitments made in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.@@@With regard to the consolidation of national peace and reconciliation, Mozambique has made remarkable progress in the process of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former Resistencia Nacional Mogambicana (RENAMO) guerrillas.@@@To date, 4,002 former RENAMO guerrillas, out of a total of 5,221, have been covered by this process.@@@We foresee the conclusion of the DDR process by the end of this year, which will be an important milestone in the implementation of the Accord for National Peace and Reconciliation signed on 6 August 2019 between the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO.@@@With the completion of this stage, we will focus on long-term reintegration and more effective reconciliation, which are crucial to ensuring the sustainability of the peace process and the consolidation of national unity.@@@The remarkable progress we are making in DDR is due to the valuable assistance and support of the United Nations and the Contact Group.@@@In order to prevent terrorist activity in some districts of Cabo Delgado province, the Government has adopted a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening the operational capacity of the Defence and Security Forces, stabilizing security and creating conditions that will enable recovery, reconstruction and socioeconomic development, so that we can reduce the vulnerability of communities to violent extremism.@@@Thanks to the actions undertaken by Mozambique, combined with the support and assistance of multilateral and bilateral cooperation partners, including SADC, the European Union and Rwanda, we have made progress in combating terrorism.@@@Mozambique’s approach is a pioneering one in terms of concerted regional action to address the global threat of terrorism.@@@The ongoing actions on the ground are enabling the re-establishment of security and, consequently, the gradual return of the people to their areas of origin and the resumption of economic and social activity in the regions previously affected by terrorist actions, through the implementation of the Cabo Delgado reconstruction programme.@@@I therefore wish to express our appreciation to all those who, directly or indirectly, have supported Mozambique in the prevention of and combat against terrorism by providing humanitarian assistance and rebuilding the economic and social fabric of the affected areas.@@@At the service of the Security Council as a non-permanent member, I reaffirm Mozambique’s commitment to the principles and objectives of the United Nations.@@@We will listen to and work in close collaboration and coordination with all Member States.@@@I would like to begin by extending my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I wish him a successful presidency of this session.@@@I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in the Assembly.@@@We are at a critical juncture as the international community is facing multifaceted challenges, ranging from armed conflicts to environmental crises and an economic downturn that have set back global development.@@@Multilateralism, which is always at the heart of international cooperation, has been undermined while unilateralism has been applied widely.@@@These challenges, already exacerbated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, have hindered and reversed the development gains attained during past decades.@@@The implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has never before been so tarnished.@@@It is disheartening that the most vulnerable peoples and countries are now suffering the most.@@@Countries in special situations — namely, the least developed countries (LDCs), the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and the small island developing States (SIDS) — which have endured the most difficult period coping with COVID-19 impacts, are additionally confronting climate, food and energy crises.@@@It is more urgent than ever before for the international community to find solutions, not only transformative, but also more practical, effective, action-oriented, sustainable and tailored to the most pressing needs, so as to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind.@@@Seventy-seven years after our United Nations was formed, we should no longer be here in the Assembly Hall to stake any claim, lecture, blame or shame one another.@@@Our world needs greater attention, concerted efforts and common desire.@@@We, as stipulated in the Charter, are the peoples of the United Nations.@@@We shall gather here to find the most appropriate solutions and take the most urgent actions to address the problems we are all facing today.@@@This cannot be done without firmly upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and preserving multilateralism.@@@Our United Nations was founded to prevent another catastrophic world war.@@@Our shared wisdom and political will to find the most pragmatic and suitable solutions to the multiple crises threatening us all today must prevail over other, individual interests.@@@In doing so, we must strengthen our solidarity, cooperation and collaboration and must not create confrontation and division.@@@As such, it is necessary, after more than seven decades, that United Nations reform revitalize and increase its ability to effectively address global problems.@@@In this context, the United Nations needs to effectively fulfil its mandate in maintaining international peace and security, as well as in promoting development cooperation.@@@It is our common desire that the United Nations be transformed in order to respond to the current global landscape and needs in our joint effort to overcome the unfolding challenges that threaten international peace and development.@@@The international community must find peaceful and lasting resolutions to any conflict and disputes around the world, including the Middle East problem.@@@We believe that unilateral sanction or measures cannot be effective, as they not only contravene the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, but also hamper the national development of other countries.@@@Sanctions, regardless of their form, will end up compromising not only one’s own interests, but those of others and inflicting suffering on everyone.@@@We must also promote peaceful solutions based on our mutual interests and build an environment conducive to development so as to safeguard lasting peace and prosperity for all.@@@In that regard, my delegation once again joins the overwhelming global call for the lifting of the economic embargo on Cuba and putting an end to all unilateral coercive measures, which have negatively impacted innocent people.@@@The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has enjoyed long-lasting peace, security and stability, which have served as favourable conditions for the national socioeconomic development of all member States.@@@We in ASEAN continue to promote regionalism and multilateralism that emphasize the importance of centrality, unity, inclusivity, mutual
benefit and respect, which are a solid foundation for all essential ASEAN cooperation frameworks.@@@Under the ASEAN framework, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has actively participated and very responsibly contributed to the promotion of peace and stability.@@@On that note, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic considers the role played by ASEAN as crucial for creating an environment conducive to a return to normalcy in Myanmar, and we should continue to engage Myanmar so as to ensure the continuation of the delivery of humanitarian assistance to its people and to explore ways and means to ensure Myanmar’s full and effective implementation of the five-point consensus towards tangible outcomes.@@@Since the inception of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, the Lao Government has presented two voluntary national reviews, in 2018 and 2021, reflecting the progress made and challenges encountered in the implementation of SDGs through its national socioeconomic development plans, Vision 2030 and the National Green Growth Strategy.@@@Nevertheless, throughout the past three years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct impact on the socioeconomic development of every country, especially the least developed countries, including the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.@@@The progress made prior to COVID-19 in the implementation of our national development and international commitments, like the SDGs and others, has therefore been severely undermined, affecting peoples’ livelihoods at all levels.@@@In addition, we are also facing extreme weather events in various parts of the world due to climate change.@@@Like many other countries, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains vulnerable to external shocks and has been severely affected by natural disasters, especially extensive flooding.@@@Over the past years, our Government has attached great importance to combating climate change through the implementation of the revised nationally determined contribution, which clearly outlines the ambitious targets of national action plans with regard to tackling and mitigating climate change with a view to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.@@@To that end, there is pressing need for adequate financial resources and technical support for gaining access to climate financing and other sources of funding to support developing countries, especially LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS, to achieve their development goals and commitments made under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@In that regard, we call for renewed political will, coupled with concrete actions, taken by the international community at the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to preserve our planet for many generations to come.@@@Having recognized the multidimensional challenges and special needs of groups of countries in special situations, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is strongly committed to the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals and programmes of action for LDCs, LLDCs, as well as other United Nations development cooperation frameworks.@@@The Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains hopeful and firmly believes that multilateralism, with the United Nations as the lead institution, can appropriately address the multiple crises and challenges the international community is facing.@@@We are strongly committed to supporting conflict resolution through peaceful means, guided by the United Nations Charter and other relevant international law.@@@We are confident that development cooperation for common interests and shared benefits must continue to be at the core of international relations.@@@To that end, more action-oriented solutions and non-politicized approaches must be adopted.@@@It is our hope that the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly will offer opportunities to enhance our solidarity and revive sustainable development paths in order for us to ensure transformative solutions to improve the livelihoods of our peoples and the planet.@@@I would like to end my statement by expressing, on behalf of the Lao Government and people, my sincere appreciations to all Member States for their kind support for our membership in the Economic and Social Council for the term 2023-2025.@@@We stand ready to serve with humility and to make meaningful contributions to the work of the Economic and Social Council, and we pledge to discharge our duties in advancing partnership towards a more resilient and sustainable world.@@@It is my pleasure to deliver the statement of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for this session on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.@@@I would like to convey to the General Assembly his sincere appreciation and wishes for its success.@@@I am also pleased to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and to wish him every success in leading this session, which has adopted the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@I commend His Excellency Mr Abdullah Shahid on his highly competent leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@My country would like to express our appreciation and respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his diligent efforts to promote and advance the goals of the United Nations.@@@The current session is being held in a very challenging global environment, including the war in Ukraine, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse terrorist threats and the threats of natural disasters caused by climate change.@@@Indeed, the range of crises in the world today and their economic, social and humanitarian repercussions are unprecedented.@@@They represent a major challenge at all levels, particularly in terms of global food insecurity.@@@It is therefore only natural that such difficult conditions have more severe and dangerous consequences for developing countries, owing to their vulnerability and lack of resilience.@@@The war in Ukraine rages at a time when the world has not yet recovered from the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@It has resulted in disruptions to both fuel and food supply chains, leading to a staggering increase of commodity prices in general.@@@Without the commendable efforts of the United Nations, Tiirkiye and other concerned parties, which led to an important agreement on resuming grain and fertilizer exports through safe corridors, the world would have faced an even greater catastrophe.@@@However, we are of the view that the measures taken by the international community are insufficient.@@@We therefore call today for increased efforts to find solutions that will ensure peace, security and a dignified life for all the peoples of the world, which as the Assembly knows are the very purposes for which the United Nations was established.@@@From this rostrum, my country, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, calls on the international community to assume its responsibilities towards developing and poor countries and to help them quickly confront the challenges that threaten their food security and contain the damage caused by those challenges.@@@In that context, we reiterate our call for the cancellation of the external debt of countries in the African continent.@@@The gap is widening day by day between two worlds — one of which has entered the fourth industrial revolution while the other is still suffering from ignorance, poverty and terrorism under the yoke of backwardness.@@@That calls on us to think carefully, and in a collective way, about finding appropriate ways to address the challenges of our times and maintain the spirit of humanity.@@@Therefore, it is worth recalling that paradox and reflecting on it in this major international meeting, which is being held under the slogan of “solidarity, sustainability and science”.@@@It also constitutes an opportunity to assess the efficacy of the adopted approaches and plans to meet common challenges.@@@Allow me in this regard to briefly mention my country’s efforts to establish the foundations of the rule of law and good governance, consolidate social cohesion, rehabilitate people and preserve their dignity and health as a way of creating the conditions for national renaissance and of overcoming obstacles to progress and prosperity.@@@Our country has taken important steps on the path to perpetuating the values of equality and justice; promoting democracy and individual and collective freedoms, including freedom of the press; adopting dialogue and consultation as a method for managing public affairs; and actively involving civil society in development strategies.@@@It has also enshrined the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, and enabled Parliament to fully exercise its oversight and accountability role.@@@Transparency has been adopted in the conduct of public affairs, the exploitation of national wealth and the development of legal and regulatory mechanisms that guarantee the eradication of corruption and bribery.@@@Our country has also strengthened efforts to protect and promote human rights by combating new forms of slavery and human trafficking.@@@With regard to strengthening social cohesion, my country’s Government, guided by His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani, has implemented important programmes to consolidate national unity and support and do justice to poor and vulnerable groups.@@@These include exercising control over the prices of basic materials, ensuring their ongoing supply to the market and preventing speculation, in addition to covering medical insurance for 15 per cent of the population as a first step towards covering all of them.@@@Moreover, our country is providing the necessary assistance to more than 85,000 refugees from the sister Republic of Mali in the Ambra camp in south-eastern Mauritania, in cooperation with the relevant United Nations representations accredited in Mauritania.@@@Within the framework of investing in human capital, extensive programmes have been prepared to train and rehabilitate young people, enable them to enter the labour market and protect them from extremism.@@@The empowerment of women and their strong participation in political life and the conduct of public affairs have also been enhanced.@@@In the same context, our country has embarked on a promising reform process for our educational system, based on an accurate diagnosis of its deficiencies.@@@All components of the educational community and stakeholders in the country have participated in its preparation, along with specialists.@@@In the field of health care, our country has redoubled its efforts to care for the citizens’ health by expanding and improving the supply of health services and ensuring access to high-quality medicines, all at a time when serious efforts are being made to strengthen and diversify the national economy and make it more resilient and able to withstand shocks and emergency crises.@@@Our country, Mauritania, has been keen to develop a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism and various forms of extremism that takes the security, ideological, economic and social dimensions into account.@@@In that context, we have worked with our regional and international partners to intensify consultation and coordination in its implementation, with all due respect for human rights.@@@As an embodiment of this vision, we consider the Group of Five for the Sahel to be an indispensable framework for confronting terrorism and achieving balanced and comprehensive development in the region.@@@Therefore, we call for it to be supported in its efforts to overcome the obstacles currently in its path.@@@In the field of the environment and sustainable development, our country is focused on renewable energies.@@@The percentage of clean energy has reached 40 per cent of the total energy we consume, and efforts are continuing to raise that percentage to achieve the set goals.@@@In this field, Mauritania is working hard to benefit from its enormous natural capacities, represented by an abundance of wind and sunlight, to produce green hydrogen in a way that supports local industries and serves the country’s economic and social development.@@@We have also achieved important results in our efforts to stop desertification and rehabilitate the areas damaged by it, as well as to rationalize the exploitation of our marine resources and restore the biodiversity of our ecosystem.@@@In that context, my country has high hopes for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh in the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt in November, and looks forward to the industrialized countries honouring their commitments to reducing emissions and the pledges they made at the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@My country, Mauritania, reiterates its ongoing support for just causes throughout in the world.@@@We stress from this rostrum our adherence to the right of the Palestinian people to dignity and sovereignty within the framework of an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant resolutions.@@@We reiterate our condemnation of the continuing Israeli violations of human rights in Palestine and the other Arab territories.@@@We reaffirm our resolve to strive seriously to reach a political solution that preserves the unity and independence of the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic, the dignity of its people and their right to live in security and peace.@@@We reiterate our support for legitimacy in brotherly Yemen and call for the pursuit of a peaceful solution, in accordance with Arab initiatives and relevant international resolutions.@@@We reiterate our firm position on the conflict in Western Sahara and our support for the efforts of the United Nations and all relevant Security Council resolutions aimed at finding a solution sustainable and acceptable to all.@@@We call for a solution that preserves the unity and sovereignty of the sisterly State of Libya, and support international efforts in this regard.@@@We reiterate our support for efforts to restore the constitutional status in the sisterly Republic of Mali.@@@We express our concern over the continuation of the war in Ukraine, and we call on the relevant parties to come to the negotiating table in order to find a solution that will end the war and spare the region and the world further tragedies and destruction.@@@On behalf of the Peruvian people, we warmly congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly.@@@I am convinced that his broad diplomatic experience and commitment to environmental issues will contribute to the success of our work.@@@I also commend and thank Secretary-@@@General Antonio Guterres for his initiatives to promote more efficient and fairer global governance and for the hard work he is doing in a troubled world that demands strong leadership.@@@The international situation is complex, difficult and delicate.@@@Strategic balances are shifting, and our peoples are concerned about the worsening context with regard to peace, the environment and the international economic situation.@@@The world is moving dangerously towards situations of confrontation and opposed interests, which are creating serious tensions that are unprecedented in history.@@@Peru reaffirms its firm position in defence of the principle of non-aggression and respect for the territorial integrity of States.@@@We reiterate that Russian Federation’s intervention in Ukraine is illegitimate, as well as our condemnation of Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories since 1967.@@@The selective application the Charter of the United Nations is not conducive to peace.@@@All armed interventions are in violation of the Charter — there is no such thing as good or bad interventions.@@@Similarly, all sanctions, other than those approved by the Security Council as part of its actions to preserve peace and security, are illegitimate and contrary to international law.@@@I repeat, all other types of unilateral sanctions, including economic sanctions, are illegitimate and contrary to international law.@@@When a war or aggression breaks out, it is the duty of the international community to work towards a ceasefire and a peaceful settlement of the conflict through diplomatic negotiations.@@@We must not encourage conflict but rather make peace our mission.@@@Peru therefore once again reiterates the need for a ceasefire in Ukraine.@@@We call for enhancing the protection of civil society affected by the conflict and for negotiations to be launched in order to find a peaceful solution that takes the interests of all parties into account.@@@At the same time, we need to ensure that the agreement enabling the export of grain from Ukraine continues and, as the Secretary-General has pointed out, make arrangements to normalize Russian fertilizer exports, the shortage of which is burdening the poorest farmers in the developing world.@@@It is crucial to prevent economic sanctions from affecting food security.@@@Ultimately, it is a matter of ensuring respect for the human right to food.@@@Regarding the question of Palestine, whose territories witnessed a surge of violence a few months ago, it is also essential for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities once and for all and support peace negotiations geared towards finding a solution based on recognizing both States — an independent and viable Palestine and an Israel with secure borders.@@@That is the only way to secure a lasting peace.@@@The Government of Peru will soon open a diplomatic outpost in Palestine, in full compliance with the principle of universality of diplomatic relations.@@@Given the context of instability and the fact that we are losing the capacity to use consensus and diplomatic negotiations to transform centres of conflict into peacebuilding situations, it is essential to take a leap forward in strengthening and expanding the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.@@@At the request of my Government, Peru has nearly doubled its number of military personnel in six peacekeeping missions around the world, especially in the peacemaking and stabilization process in the Central African Republic.@@@We are also committed to making short-term police contributions.@@@Just a few days ago, in Lima, I opened the first Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Peacekeeping Operations on the theme “Living in Peace”.@@@The convening of the Conference demonstrates a determined push to increase the participation of Latin America and the Caribbean in United Nations peacekeeping operations, in accordance with the principles of consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force, except in legitimate self-defence.@@@More importantly, the Lima Conference made the decision to establish a Latin American and Caribbean network for cooperation in peacekeeping operations.@@@Peru is committed to ensuring the immediate set-up and launch of the network.@@@Latin America, which played a decisive role in establishing the United Nations, must, through solidarity and joint action, step up its contribution to conflict resolution and peace.@@@That is its historical tradition.@@@In that regard, my Government will be ramping up the consultations to establish South America as a zone of international peace.@@@As indicated in the preamble to the UNESCO constitution, since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defence of peace must be constructed.@@@Building the values of peace in the minds of men means respecting others, protecting human rights and not exploiting the weakest, as well as promoting dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes.@@@But above all, it means eradicating — as the United Nations systematically does, with the permanent support of Peru — hateful ideologies, racism, intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.@@@Peace, on the other hand, requires us to acknowledge that humankind has a common destiny.@@@Acting responsibly to build that common future means respecting the principle of non-intervention and, at the same time, showing solidarity with the poor, the weak, the dispossessed and the vulnerable.@@@Acting responsibly to build that common future means respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; the collective rights of peoples and the rights
of indigenous peoples.@@@States have a duty not only to guarantee their peoples’ freedom but also to ensure that they can enjoy the social rights that underpin human dignity, including the human rights to education, health, housing, water, food, a living wage and, thanks to the General Assembly, the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.@@@Peacebuilding also involves fulfilling the mandate to resolve the still-pending situation of colonial peoples and territories.@@@Peru fought for its independence in the early nineteenth century based on the principle of self- determination of peoples.@@@Peru’s diplomacy since 1947 has therefore firmly supported and continues to support granting independence and self-determination to the territories and peoples that are under the mandate of the United Nations to ensure their independence.@@@Peru has re-established diplomatic relations with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and firmly supports its right to self-determination.@@@The actions to be taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary- General to re-establish the ceasefire in the Western Sahara and promote a negotiated and peaceful solution have our widest support.@@@In the same vein, Peru fully recognizes the Argentina’s sovereignty rights of the over the Malvinas Islands and urges the parties to begin consultations and negotiations in order to realize that crucial objective.@@@The international economic situation is becoming dire.@@@The pandemic’s negative effects on production processes and, especially, the deterioration it has entailed in the living standards of the poor and extremely poor majorities, as well as the problems it has created in the regularization of supply chains, inflation and rising energy prices, are unleashing a major world crisis, which will cause more poverty and exclusion.@@@Global growth indicators are not encouraging; indeed, global growth is declining.@@@Latin America is suffering the negative effects of inflation and the decline of economic growth.@@@It is also struggling to restore its efforts to combat poverty and extreme poverty to their pre-pandemic levels.@@@The region has increasingly high rates of debt that are difficult to sustain.@@@In order to address those global and regional trends, which are affecting opportunities for potential growth, Peru has adopted a plan to boost economic growth known as Impulso Peru.@@@Our definitive goal is, in all cases, to grow the economy by 3.3 per cent above the average target for Latin America.@@@We are convinced that our most important objective should be to create more better-quality jobs, and to that end, we are promoting and improving conditions for national and foreign investment.@@@The plan also makes special considerations for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.@@@Peru is a country with stable and positive macroeconomic variables, an economy open to private and public investment for the benefit of those who need it most.@@@Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has raised the need for a new global social compact.@@@That new commitment needs to be linked to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are now seriously compromised.@@@We need to reaffirm our political will to ensure that the United Nations development system, within the framework of all its agencies, prioritizes achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals in the most critical areas of our times, including the reduction by half the proportion of people living in poverty; eradicating extreme poverty; making zero hunger a reality to provide food security for all families; achieving efficient and universal health coverage for all; ensuring that all boys and girls complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education; ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls worldwide; achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all; and progressively achieving and sustaining income growth for the poorest 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average.@@@We need to ensure the strength and effectiveness of the new global compact by renewing our commitment to focusing our political will and financial resources on meeting the 2030 Agenda goals.@@@The 2030 Agenda is not only a programme for peace, justice and equality at the global level; it is also on essential part of our national agendas.@@@This year, extreme heat and flooding have reached record-high levels as a result of climate change.@@@Greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise.@@@Those are Mother Earth’s warning calls for us end our assault on nature.@@@I call especially on the industrialized nations to give a new impetus to curbing global warming.@@@As Heads of State, we must acknowledge that our targets for meeting our commitments to reducing new emissions already need to be seven times higher in order to achieve our goal of keeping the planet’s temperature from rising more than 1.5°C.@@@The United Nations has
reaffirmed its support for protecting the rights and lives of environmental defenders and for ensuring access to information on the environment for citizens and indigenous peoples.@@@The Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as the Escazu Agreement, which Peru has signed, reflects the efforts of the peoples of Latin America to implement the General Assembly’s historic resolution 76/300, on recognizing environmental rights as human rights.@@@The Escazu Agreement is an instrument to affirm our sovereignty over natural resources in the Amazon.@@@The oceans also require urgent compacts to preserve marine life and ecosystems and their biodiversity.@@@Peru supports negotiations for a treaty to regulate fishing activities and eradicate pollution of the seas beyond 200 miles from their coasts.@@@We firmly reiterate our claim to our maritime zone up to 200 miles, as established in our Constitution.@@@Latin America has a democratic tradition, yet it also has the highest levels of social inequality.@@@But the Latin American peoples continue to move forward with the historical strength of the justness of their cause in the search for fairer, more egalitarian societies with greater social cohesion, where the common good is for all and there is no exclusion.@@@That is the path we are on in Peru.@@@Democracy by its very nature involves conflicting political positions.@@@That is what freedom is all about.@@@But democratic governance requires respect for institutions and, above all, for the will of the people.@@@Coups d’etat, regardless of how they are orchestrated or the power of the States promoting them, are illegitimate.@@@They are an attack on the sovereign expression of the will of the people.@@@In the same way we address external crises, any crisis of governance or confrontation involving the powers of the State must be resolved through dialogue, agreement and full respect for the electoral results.@@@The Inter-American Democratic Charter, Peru’s contribution to democracy in the Americas, emphatically establishes that principle.@@@In a world where both tendencies to conflict and internal political crises are increasing, we need four pillars for defending democratic governance: respect for peoples, willingness to resolve conflicts through negotiation, respect for human rights and respect for the institution of the rule of law.@@@I am Head of State of a multi-ethnic and multicultural country whose development of high civilizations dates back more than 3,000 years, and which has also faced difficulties in eliminating racism and social inequality.@@@My Government reflects the demands, hopes and dreams of those who have had nothing or very little to help them integrate into civic life as actors in their own destiny.@@@Peru’s social inclusion agenda mirrors the new social compact that the United Nations wants for all the peoples of the world.@@@It is an agenda that prioritizes the principle of leaving no one behind, as well as inclusion that benefits all people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable — for a world for all.@@@Let	me	join previous speakers in extending our congratulations to Ambassador Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to pay a fitting tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his effective guidance and excellent leadership during some of the most challenging and uneasy times for all of humankind.@@@Our world is going through turbulent times.@@@We are witnessing a transformation of the existing world order.@@@Issues such as terrorism, extremism, drug and arms trafficking, cybercrime and other forms of cross-border organized crime are threatening to increase exponentially.@@@In order to discuss them further, the Government of Tajikistan, together with the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and its partners, will be holding a high-level international conference in Dushanbe on 18 and 19 October on the theme of international and regional border security and management cooperation in countering terrorism and preventing the movement of terrorists.@@@We invite everyone to attend that important conference.@@@Climate change, natural disasters, food insecurity and the ongoing impact of the pandemic, among other things, are adding further fuel to the fire.@@@The international community needs tools that can help us deal with a rapidly deteriorating environment.@@@Mechanisms that were established decades ago are now finding it difficult to cope with the emerging challenges.@@@The world needs more robust multilateralism to tackle the toughest challenges, with the United Nations at the helm.@@@Tajikistan therefore supports the Secretary- General’s efforts aimed at comprehensive reform of our Organization in order to strengthen its ability to respond rapidly and adequately to development needs and address contemporary threats efficiently.@@@We have a historic opportunity to steer change in a direction that benefits all humankind, and we should not waste it.@@@I would like to address three additional topics my delegation feels are very important to our implementation of our road map — the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, water and climate change, and peace and security.@@@Tajikistan strongly affirms its commitments to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@As we are lagging behind on many of the SDGs, the Government of Tajikistan has taken bold steps to integrate them into our national policies and development plans.@@@However, despite the substantial progress made towards their achievement, there are significant risks, such as climate-related hazards and disasters, that could slow or reverse Tajikistan’s path towards the realization of the 2030 Agenda and threaten agricultural productivity and food security.@@@This year the world has witnessed unprecedented water-related natural disasters.@@@While we have all been struggling with their consequences, we are becoming increasingly aware that water is vital and a resource we must value, protect and manage effectively.@@@We need actions that can make a real difference.@@@Between 6 and 9 June, we held the second Dushanbe Water Decade Conference in Tajikistan, which has become a key preparatory meeting for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade in 2023.@@@As the Assembly is aware, from 22 to 24 March the United Nations will convene only its second Water Conference in 46 years.@@@The 2023 United Nations Water Conference will be a good opportunity for all of us to review and evaluate the progress that has been made, as well as the gaps and obstacles we have encountered, in realizing the goals of the Water Decade.@@@Tajikistan and the Netherlands, leading the preparations for that global event, are working diligently and are determined to make the Conference a watershed moment for the whole world.@@@That is why we have launched the Water Action Agenda as one of the outcomes of the 2023 United Nations Water Conference and expect and encourage everyone to come to the Conference with new commitments to enrich it.@@@This is important and necessary not only for us today, but also for our children and our future generations.@@@The impact of climate change on water resources is another crucial topic that requires our concerted efforts.@@@Alongside the increase in mud flows, floods, water scarcity and droughts, and changes in the hydrological cycle, today the accelerated melting of glaciers, the primary source of fresh water on the planet, is of great concern.@@@To that end, Tajikistan is actively promoting an integrated approach to addressing water and climate issues, including within the Water and Climate Coalition.@@@During the Coalition’s first meeting, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of Tajikistan, proposed declaring 2025 an international year of glacier preservation.@@@We are currently working on a draft resolution to advance that initiative through the Second Committee of the General Assembly.@@@We seek Member States’ constructive engagement and support for that important draft resolution.@@@The response to the ever-increasing threat of terrorism and extremism should be comprehensive, with the United Nations as a key coordinator.@@@For its part, Tajikistan has undertaken several measures in that direction.@@@We have, among other things, adopted our National Strategy and Action Plan of the Republic of Tajikistan on Countering Terrorism and Extremism for 2021-2025 and expressed our readiness to tackle this issue.@@@Tajikistan strongly believes that small States should also have a greater chance to contribute to finding solutions for maintaining peace and security.@@@Hence, following years of contributions to multilateralism through active participation in United Nations activities and processes and having unique experience in peacemaking and insightful knowledge about Afghanistan, the time has come for Tajikistan to seek, for the first time, a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2028-2029.@@@We are looking forward to working closely with all Member States to gain trust and support for that vital campaign.@@@Tajikistan, a peace-loving country that went through a devastating, imposed civil war, is very aware of the cost and long-lasting consequences of war.@@@Therefore, we cannot remain indifferent to the fate of our immediate neighbours — the noble people of Afghanistan, who have suffered enough for the past 40 years.@@@They deserve peace and tranquility.@@@Exactly one year ago, in this same Hall, the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, in his virtual message before the General Assembly, dedicated more than half of his statement to the situation in Afghanistan (see A/76/PV.11, annex III).@@@His concerns and warnings, unfortunately, fell on deaf ears.@@@One year after the fall of Afghanistan, no inclusive Government has been formed, despite repeated calls from Afghans, regional countries and the international community for greater ethnic, political and geographical diversity in the de facto administrative structures.@@@The country is on the verge of a humanitarian and economic catastrophe.@@@To ease the suffering of the Afghan people during these difficult times, Tajikistan has provided its infrastructure, territory and means of communication to all stakeholders and donor countries to deliver humanitarian assistance directly to the people of Afghanistan.@@@We have also never stopped providing the people of Afghanistan with much-needed electricity since the Taliban came to power.@@@The environment of intimidation and the deterioration in respect for human rights, including the rights of women and girls, is overwhelming.@@@Diverging opinions and existing internal contradictions within the Taliban and the emergence of additional armed opposition groups, including the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan and other terrorist groups, make the security situation in the country even more fragile.@@@Furthermore, the Taliban’s inability to control its militants and other terrorist groups further complicates the already difficult situation.@@@The recent discovery and killing of one of Al-Qaida’s top strategic minds in Kabul is a vivid testimony to those ties.@@@Afghanistan is rapidly becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups and a springboard for spreading the Taliban’s radical extremism.@@@In addition, we are witnessing systematic work on transferring militant groups consisting of former nationals of Central Asia to the north of Afghanistan aimed at consolidating and creating a new hotbed of tensions near our border.@@@Unfortunately, the implications for Tajikistan, which shares 1,400 kilometres of border with that country, are enormous.@@@In the current alarming situation, it is paramount for Tajikistan to strengthen its border with Afghanistan and create the necessary border infrastructure along its entire length.@@@At the same time, we believe that the participation of Afghanistan in the process of multifaceted regional cooperation is key to the success of the efforts undertaken by the international community.@@@On 20 September, the leader of the Kyrgyz Republic delivered his speech from this high rostrum and talked about the Kyrgyz version of the conflict on the Tajik-Kyrgyz border (see A/77/PV.4).@@@It is regrettable that the issue of the settlement of the State border line between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which we inherited from history, was groundlessly raised at the General Assembly.@@@I believe it is important to inform the Assembly that, on 19 September, the authorized representatives of the two sides signed a protocol on the settlement of the situation at the border.@@@All hostilities have ceased.@@@The troops and military equipment of both sides must be withdrawn to their places of permanent deployment.@@@A joint inspection was organized in the border area.@@@A joint task force has been set up to monitor the implementation of the agreement reached.@@@Most importantly, both parties reaffirmed their commitment to resolving all bilateral issues exclusively by political and diplomatic means.@@@Tajikistan has followed and will always follow that principle when any issues arise, including the settlement of the situation on the border.@@@It is with deep regret that Kyrgyzstan is deviating from the agreement reached, creating a false appearance of withdrawing troops and heavy military equipment from the line of contact by hiding them in populated areas near the border.@@@Therefore, the responsibility for any next round of tensions on the Tajik-Kyrgyz border will lie exclusively with Kyrgyzstan.@@@The leader of our neighbouring country, in his speech, mentioned the death of its citizens and financial damage, creating the false impression that the tragedy on the border affected that country exclusively.@@@The evidence says otherwise.@@@As a result of the military aggression of Kyrgyzstan, more than 40 civilians of Tajikistan were killed, and approximately 200 were injured.@@@The casualties included pregnant women, children, the elderly, doctors and devout Muslims who were attending the mourning ceremony in the mosque.@@@In addition to border facilities, schools, hospitals, religious buildings, residential buildings, infrastructure and utilities were destroyed.@@@Indeed, who is the aggressor there?@@@Tajikistan is currently channelling significant resources to rebuilding destroyed houses and vital infrastructure.@@@The tragedy that happened in the border area was not accidental.@@@Since the previous autumn, our neighbours have been preparing for aggression, which manifested as the creation of military infrastructure near our borders.@@@In recent years, our neighbours have often spoken, including from this high rostrum, about the importance of an international transport artery and the creation of favourable conditions for transportation, while advocating for the removal of barriers to economic cooperation, the simplification of border-crossing procedures and transit between countries and regions.@@@At the same time, Kyrgyzstan often creates problems for the transit of goods to and from Tajikistan, delaying vehicles carrying thousands of tons of our cargo.@@@It is important to note that we have managed to successfully resolve the border issues with China and Uzbekistan through a lengthy process involving all parties.@@@We have accumulated substantial experience, which is important to use in its entirety when resolving border issues on the basis of mutual respect, trust and openness.@@@Over the 20-year history of negotiations with Kyrgyzstan, we have signed dozens of protocols.@@@However, as time passes and the political groups in power change, the country continuously revisits those documents and implements only the provisions that favour it exclusively, while ignoring the other provisions.@@@As of today, both countries have managed to agree on and develop a draft description of about 602 kilometres of our joint border, which is approximately 61 per cent of its total length.@@@Tajikistan, relying on the international practice of border delimitation, has repeatedly offered to its neighbours to record the results of those many years of work on paper by signing an agreement on separate sections of the border.@@@But our neighbours strictly declined that proposal.@@@The leadership of Kyrgyzstan mentioned at this high rostrum the Agreement establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Alma- Ata Declaration, presenting them as a legal framework for determining the State border.@@@However, I must emphasize that the issue of determining the border line is not the subject of the regulation of those documents.@@@To our deep regret, relying on its unilateral approach, since the 1950s, Kyrgyzstan has arbitrarily seized more than 2,110 square kilometres that rightfully belong to Tajikistan.@@@Our neighbours have not mentioned anything about that, either.@@@I would like to inform the General Assembly that Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have reached an agreement on the description of the State border line according to the documents of the national territorial delimitation of 1924-1927.@@@Those documents have gone through all the constitutional procedures and, accordingly, are the only legal framework for continuing the negotiation process.@@@Despite that, in order to show goodwill and maximum flexibility, we met our neighbour halfway and agreed to also use the documents of the 1989 parity commission proposed by Kyrgyzstan.@@@Border issues are not resolved by populist statements and the creation of crisis situations.@@@We need daily, thoughtful, joint work based on the political will of the parties.@@@We stand ready to continue negotiations.@@@We firmly believe that the Tajik and Kyrgyz peoples have the right to live together and build together an atmosphere of peace, friendship and harmony.@@@Tajikistan, having survived the horrors of internal conflict, understands the value of peace and will make every effort to ensure that security and stability reign in our region.@@@Our strength is in our unity.@@@That lesson — that together we can achieve much more than we can alone — is a lesson that the world of today is learning in circumstances unanticipated in the twenty- first century: first the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and now the cruel war in Ukraine.@@@Now and in the future, the democratic world needs unity in overcoming the global consequences that the countries of Europe and worldwide are facing.@@@At the onset of the joint and united efforts made in response to the start of the war, the Republic of North Macedonia immediately and decisively aligned itself with European Union foreign policy and that of the democratic world.@@@We joined global efforts in response to the war as a country committed to peace and to finding dialogue-based solutions and fully dedicated to European values.@@@In doing so, we relied on our own experience and lessons learned, according to which peace, strength and progress can be achieved only with unity.@@@We learned this lesson both when we peacefully declared independence in 1991, and in 2001 when we rose above internal inter-ethnic conflict, while today we rely on our experience in pursuing our established concept of “One society for all”, thereby setting an example of a functional, multi-ethnic democracy, while serving as a significant factor for stability in the Western Balkans and consequently in Europe,
which makes us a reliable partner of the international democratic community.@@@Functional solutions that work in a small area always serve as a road map to finding solutions in the global setting.@@@No matter how many challenges arise in a given wide geographic area, they tend to erupt in a certain smaller area, only later becoming a potential global threat.@@@That point of eruption today is an independent and sovereign State — Ukraine — whose citizens are faced with an unacceptable and unjustifiable aggression by the Russian Federation.@@@There are two especially concerning aspects that demand our full attention.@@@One is related to the fact that a permanent member of the Security Council — the Russian Federation — committed the aggression.@@@The fact that a country has decided to resolve a challenge using force — despite being a Member of an Organization founded on a commitment to preserving world peace — runs contrary to all endeavours and commitments of the civilized world to put an end to all forms of action that cause loss of human life and jeopardize the global peace.@@@Furthermore, the demonstration of force by a geographically larger country against a geographically smaller country that is committed to fostering and sharing democratic values is a dangerous and impermissible precedent.@@@In simple terms, everything must be done to prevent that from becoming a practice in this world we share, where there are geographically smaller and bigger countries.@@@As we can see, problems are multidimensional and affect us all.@@@These are the challenges we will all face in the winter ahead, the most severe since the Second World War — to ensure the availability of food and energy for our citizens.@@@Therefore, we must search for solutions while acting in unison.@@@Our response or solutions to interlocking challenges is the essential topic of this debate — that solutions are to be found in solidarity and must be sustainable and science-based.@@@Speaking of sustainability, I believe that we should take into consideration another bitter experience from the war in Ukraine.@@@The struggle for peace is ongoing and peace requires continual dedication to mutual understanding, vigilance and prompt action.@@@I should like to convey a clear message from my country.@@@The unprovoked aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine is a gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international legal norms and principles.@@@The aggression cannot be justified or relativized.@@@The Russian Federation must put an immediate end to the aggression and withdraw its troops from Ukraine.@@@History teaches us that no problem can be resolved by using force.@@@Putting an end to the aggression is the necessary precondition to opening the only feasible way of finding a solution, namely, diplomacy and dialogue.@@@The latter can and must be the sole mechanism for settling disputes and resolving differences between countries.@@@The uncertainty of the food and energy supply will deepen differences at the global level between the rich North and the poor South and bring millions of people to the brink of adversity, even threatening them with hunger.@@@We will all — the economically more developed and economically less developed countries alike — feel the impact.@@@We must rely on lessons learned from the pandemic.@@@International solidarity should not be guided by whether it is needed among the better developed countries or among the less developed.@@@That is especially true if we want to prevent the rise of new challenges ensuing from the growing dissatisfaction of citizens in global terms.@@@The pandemic has reminded us that we are all equal when faced with a common and, in this case, invisible enemy that has cost millions of human lives worldwide.@@@The pandemic has also brought to light the importance of solidarity and unity, transposed into concrete, intentional cooperation.@@@These are the principles that should guide our future actions when we face present and future challenges.@@@In the specific context of overcoming the consequences of the war in Ukraine, it is necessary to redouble our efforts to enhance international solidarity and mutual assistance on an equal footing, both in the European Union, where the impact of the Ukraine war is greatest, and worldwide.@@@This applies in particular to finding viable solutions to overcoming challenges related to the supply of both energy and food.@@@In that context, I underscore the important active role of Secretary-General Guterres and that of Tiirkiye’s mediation in the exportation of wheat from Ukraine.@@@Developments in and surrounding Ukraine have pushed numerous other conflicts worldwide into the background.@@@However, the focus on such conflicts must remain sharp.@@@Terrorism in all its forms is still a global threat to all humankind.@@@Numerous hybrid threats are a cause of great concern and distress.@@@Fake news and the opportunity for social networks to disseminate such
news on a mass scale via the internet are a challenge facing the entire democratic world.@@@Authoritarian tendencies, disguised under the veil of disingenuous patriotism, pose a serious threat to human rights and freedoms and prompt potential instability.@@@We also face the burning issue of climate change, despite all efforts to put up a joint and united front in saving our planet Earth.@@@The recent catastrophic floods in Pakistan are but one of the latest visible consequences in a series of extreme natural disasters worldwide caused by climate change.@@@Biodiversity loss, air pollution and the lack of water impose themselves as priority threats, not only to the environment and ecosystems, but also to people’s lives.@@@This situation will persist until every individual becomes fully aware that nature is not ours but is part of us, and that we must treat it as such.@@@All these problems demand concerted action, founded on intensified and consolidated efforts focused both on prevention and on finding solutions.@@@Conflicts, instability, violence and climate change cause the spread of grave poverty for millions of people, as well as population displacements that are growing into an exodus.@@@The waves of migration we have faced in recent years from Syria and Afghanistan are not winding down.@@@Now, we also have millions of refugees from Ukraine.@@@The Republic of North Macedonia has opened its doors to citizens of Ukraine who have been forced to flee their homeland and seek refuge in our country.@@@This is a good opportunity to duly commend countries worldwide that have welcomed the largest number of refugees, as well as the substantial number of citizens throughout the world who work every day to provide care for refugees and help those in need.@@@My country, the Republic of North Macedonia, using its available capacities, remains committed to honouring its international commitments in the humanitarian area.@@@If we are to successfully address and manage diverse forms of immigration, it is necessary to strengthen the awareness that this is a global challenge that necessitates coordinated activities in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility.@@@We learn from experience that no problem is a minor problem.@@@Every minor problem has the potential to grow into a more difficult and larger-scale problem.@@@However, our coming together here at United Nations Headquarters serves as a good reminder that strength and solutions can be achieved when we unite in support of genuine values.@@@Multilateralism and respect for established rules and obligations, starting with the United Nations Charter, are the only way of providing the much-needed predictability in international relations.@@@We are building our future now, today and together.@@@Despite all the deficiencies of international mechanisms, multilateralism and the United Nations, as its most visible and recognized form, endowed with the universal mission of preserving the peace, are still the key important catalysts encouraging joint efforts towards a better, safer and more just world.@@@Global challenges require a global response.@@@No country can deal with twenty-first century problems on its own.@@@Now more than ever, we need to demonstrate that multilateralism works and gives results in times of crisis.@@@In that context, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) is to be our road map in pursuing global governance reforms that would open the way for the United Nations multilateral central system to adapt to the future and be able to contribute to joint endeavours.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of course remains the starting point in pursuing global action.@@@The Agenda not only addresses the chronic and persistent problems of poverty and inequitable development, but can also serve as a platform for finding solutions to all other problems, starting with the need for us to unite behind a new agenda for peace, while placing the human dimension in the focus of technological development in the digital era.@@@The Republic of North Macedonia is working intensively to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals and supports all efforts aimed at making the United Nations stronger and more efficient.@@@In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as other development activities in the national, regional and global settings, we need to ground ourselves on the premise that we owe it to young generations to provide them with the conditions for progress.@@@Young people, their access to modern, forward- looking education and the resolution of problems they face must be at the centre of our attention and of our political engagement in the coming years.@@@In that respect, I should like to emphasize that, for the second consecutive year, a youth representative from the Republic of North Macedonia is participating in the work of the General Assembly.@@@On 1 January 2023, the Republic of North Macedonia will have the honour of assuming the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the largest regional security organization.@@@This brings great responsibility, especially in light of the fact that my country will be taking over the OSCE chairmanship at a time when there is a military aggression in Europe, along with all ensuing consequences for peace and security in the OSCE area and beyond.@@@Nevertheless, I am confident that we will successfully justify the trust bestowed upon us.@@@North Macedonia has at times been the beneficiary of mediation-security mechanisms, including a United Nations peace mission, and has had first-hand experience of the benefits of the peacebuilding efforts of the international community.@@@Relying on such experience, we stand ready to contribute to strengthening and developing security in the wider context.@@@As the 2023 OSCE Chair, we will be fully committed to the noble mission of serving peace and security as a precondition for economic and social development, and I am confident that we will contribute to advancing multilateral security mechanisms.@@@Our confidence is based on our practice of living together in unity and on the related benefits in the national, regional and international contexts.@@@Today in this Hall, I represent a country in which all ethnic communities have equal, constitutionally guaranteed rights and obligations.@@@We are working to make the Republic of North Macedonia a civic, democratic society in which differences are regarded as an enriching advantage, and not as an obstacle.@@@Standing united as a multi-ethnic, functional democracy, today we are a successful example of a mini-Europe in the Balkans.@@@However, bearing in mind the significance of mutual understanding, respect and support, which prompt and motivate unity, working together with our two neighbours, Albania and Serbia, we have established the Open Balkan initiative.@@@Today, the initiative has grown into a successful example of regional interconnectivity.@@@It has also contributed to our shared commitment to removing unnecessary barriers to the movement of people, trade, the transport of goods and the provision of services.@@@In the present circumstances, the initiative has enabled us to ensure the availability of food for our citizens, based on our agreement to help each other if faced with food shortages in our respective domestic markets as a consequence of the global crisis.@@@We have further agreed that there will be no bans on trade in basic agricultural and food products.@@@We are also intensively considering options for cross-border trade in electricity and providing assistance with various energy sources as part of our effort to overcome the serious energy situation the entire world is facing.@@@We are also developing good-neighbourly relations with a keen sense of responsibility and through dialogue, convinced that safeguarding national and State interests does not run contrary to broader integration processes and advanced cooperation with countries in our neighbourhood.@@@Quite the contrary, self-affirmation finds its most relevant and appropriate reflection in a wider community of shared values.@@@Guided by these policies of building bridges, while employing functional diplomacy, dialogue and understanding, we have succeeded in accomplishing the strategic goal of becoming part of NATO, and today we are a proud, fully-fledged member of the Alliance.@@@Seventeen long years after we were granted European Union (EU) membership candidate status, we have started accession negotiations with the EU.@@@My country attaches particular importance to our speedy EU integration.@@@We are working with dedication and persistence to undertake all the steps required for the accomplishment of my country’s second strategic goal.@@@The citizens of North Macedonia have waited far too long for this moment, and I acknowledge and understand their frustration and fatigue on this long road to Europe.@@@But we have no alternative path to reaching our goal of better living standards.@@@No one promised that the road would be an easy one.@@@Indeed, despite the difficulties, the EU still represents the best option for our future and that of our children.@@@We have neither the opportunity nor the privilege to abandon it.@@@Now is the time to maintain full speed ahead and even redouble our pace.@@@I would like to underscore that the EU membership of the Republic of North Macedonia is of essential importance also to the European Union itself, especially in the new circumstances of the global context, in which such a message of encouragement that the enlargement process continues and awaits the entire region, which, regardless of its progressive leadership, is not immune to global challenges.@@@This is especially true in conditions in which the European integration and democratic path of the Western Balkan countries should and must be ensured as a contribution to European peace.@@@The story of my homeland, the Republic of North Macedonia, which two weeks ago celebrated 31 years of independence, is a story of peace, cooperation and understanding, through which it was established while dealing with challenges and overcoming threats both to our internal stability and on our way to international integration.@@@I therefore underline that we are solution-oriented, working together to face challenges that do not recognize State borders or ethnic, linguistic, religious or any other differences.@@@I am especially honoured and pleased that, as Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia, I have the opportunity to addressing Members for the first time here at the United Nations, the Organization that is the guardian of peace, solidarity and prosperity.@@@I would like to offer my appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his successful work.@@@I am confident that Mr. Csaba Korosi, who has assumed the presidency of the Assembly at the seventy-seventh session, will be equally successful.@@@The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have brought to light human weaknesses and fragility even in our modern twenty-first century.@@@Yet, as the pandemic has also demonstrated the power of innovation and the ability of science to quickly produce the necessary vaccines, humankind must also continue relying on science and keep believing in its humanistic foundations and capabilities and peace.@@@We are all in the same boat and we have no other choice except to treat each other with solidarity and work in unity, defending and advancing the fundamental values of freedom and peace throughout the world.@@@Peace is reached by making compromises, but peace is preserved with mutual understanding.@@@I am delighted to sincerely congratulate President Csaba Korosi on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and to wish him every success.@@@We also express our appreciation for the efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@We greatly value the theme of this session of the Assembly and call for more international solidarity, joint multilateral action and the activation of cooperation mechanisms in order to find sustainable solutions to global challenges and reduce their negative repercussions for all peoples, particularly in countries emerging from conflict and less developed countries.@@@I am pleased to be giving an overview of political developments in the Sudan and reiterating our commitment to achieving peace and promoting mechanisms for a peaceful transition in order to establish full democracy, and by holding fair and transparent elections by the end of the transition period to establish a civilian regime that represents every Sudanese citizen.@@@In order to ensure that opportunities for entering into dialogue and holding consultations are available to all, we announced in an armed forces communique that we were withdrawing the military as an institution from that dialogue and from participation in the Government.@@@The aim is to enable the political and revolutionary forces that believe in the democratic transition and the goals of the people’s great December revolution to form a civilian Government under leadership of national competence.@@@All except the National Party would participate in the Government in order to fulfil the remaining requirements of the transitional period.@@@In that regard, we reiterate our commitment to cooperating with the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS) in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the UNITAMS mandate set forth in Security Council resolution 2559 (2020) and the list of requests from the Sudan to the United Nations.@@@We also reiterate our continued cooperation with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei.@@@We emphasize that we are positively considering the many initiatives aimed at achieving national accord in the Sudan, particularly the national initiatives that have been subject to intense consultations in which various civilian stakeholders participate, such as political parties, youth and revolutionary elements, civil- society organizations and signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement.@@@We hope that can lead to a broad consensus that will ultimately enable a democratic transition to take place through the holding of free and transparent elections.@@@In order to achieve that national accord, we have provided all the necessary support to the tripartite mechanism led by UNITAMS, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).@@@Despite that support, the mechanism has taken up a great deal of time without actually fulfilling its goals, which has complicated the discussions of the national accord.@@@Our efforts since the December revolution have resulted in the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement, which has mitigated the conflict in Darfur and improved security and stability in the region.@@@In that regard, we call on our brothers Abdul Aziz Al-Hilu and Abdel Wahid Mohamed Nour to join the peace march and work together to build the Sudan of the future.@@@In the Darfur region, and following the achievement of peace and community reconciliation, the rate of voluntary return of displaced persons has increased and the first group of the joint forces has been established to protect civilians.@@@In that regard, we urge the international community to provide us with assistance in advancing peace efforts pursuant to the Juba Peace Agreement.@@@Despite the acknowledged challenges that our country is addressing domestically, the Sudan has been playing a positive and constructive role in supporting peace and achieving stability and development in our region, as well as through its effective role in implementing the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.@@@We have also been cooperating with our brothers in Somalia.@@@Moreover, and in coordination with the African Union, the Sudan has played a role in
reaching a peace agreement in our sister nation of the Central African Republic and has participated actively in meetings to promote peace, security and cooperation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Furthermore, we led efforts to promote development and cooperation among countries in the Horn of Africa and East Africa during our presidency of the IGAD summit.@@@We are also continuing our joint border-control activities with our neighbour and sister nation Chad and are keen to coordinate and follow up with the relevant stakeholders with a view to helping our neighbour Libya establish security.@@@The Sudan has also undertaken major efforts to fight terrorism, human trafficking, transnational crime and organized crime and is cooperating with all relevant countries and organizations in that regard.@@@We are firm in our support to all peoples in exercising their legitimate rights in line with international legislation.@@@The Sudan is working tirelessly to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), because we believe deeply in the value of the outcome document of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@In that connection, the transitional Government adopted a strategic document on poverty reduction for the period from 2021 to 2023 and presented its second voluntary national report in July 2021.@@@Needless to say, while we are continuing those efforts, we still need assistance from our brothers, friends and international development partners in standing with the Sudan.@@@We reiterate our full commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda so that our recovery process can be more flexible and sustainable.@@@However, external debt is a real obstacle hindering my country’s ability to promote socioeconomic development through the implementation of the SDGs.@@@As we are all aware, the Sudan is eligible to benefit from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, and I therefore call on the international community and all our brotherly and friendly countries to honour the commitments and obligations they made at the related meetings in Paris and Berlin in 2020 and 2021, considering that the Sudan has enacted all the legislation required to enable it to benefit from debt relief.@@@The crisis brought on by high food and energy prices demands further international cooperation.@@@In that context, we reiterate that the Sudan is qualified to receive assistance in achieving food security at the regional and international levels.@@@From this rostrum, I call on the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as regional organizations and brotherly and friendly countries, to support my country’s efforts to meet that goal through the transfer of agricultural technology, capacity-building and support for agricultural research centres.@@@The Sudan has hosted millions of brotherly refugees from across the continent for decades and has kept its doors open to them.@@@We have shared our limited resources with them and provided them with protection despite a difficult economic situation that is familiar to all.@@@Considering how that situation is being exacerbated by the effects of climate change, drought, floods and insufficient humanitarian assistance, we urge for a collective commitment to providing assistance, led by the relevant United Nations agencies, donor countries, brothers and friends, in support of the communities that host the refugees.@@@In the area of disarmament, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a priority for the Sudan.@@@Like many developing countries, the Sudan suffers from the effects of this dangerous phenomenon, which so often has economic and social repercussions and has been spreading among tribes and population groups, making the task of collecting such weapons extremely difficult.@@@We are more conscious than most of this dangerous problem and the importance of eradicating it through regional and international cooperation.@@@With regard to the issue of Security Council reform, we approach it within the context of the Common African Position.@@@The Sudan’s position vis-a-vis the informal intergovernmental negotiations on reform is based on stressing the importance and centrality of Security Council reform and the need for it to be comprehensive, including by encompassing the Council’s working methods, in order to address the negative effects of current practices, which are visible in the fact that texts are often drafted unilaterally and individual penholders wield control over countries on the Council’s agenda.@@@In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to all the brother nations that have stood by my country in the most difficult times.@@@We urge the United Nations and the international community, along with our friends and brothers, to continue to show even greater solidarity with our country during this stage of its development.@@@Let me commend the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his sustained efforts in returning the General Assembly to its pre-pandemic work pace and for his message of hope.@@@Let me also extend my congratulations to you, Mr. Korosi, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly.@@@I am gratefully optimistic about your leadership in these unprecedented times.@@@I also commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for galvanizing the necessary multilateral support in search of solutions to meet the scale and urgency of current global challenges.@@@His timely submission of his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which
speaks to strengthening global governance with a focus on a future agenda driven by multilateral solidarity and collective action, is also commendable.@@@As our world wrestles with an unprecedented and volatile economic outlook resulting from the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other crises, the theme of this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is most appropriate and timely.@@@Our progress towards achieving the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 has been complicated by the repurposing of global development and investment finance, disruptions in production and supply chains, growing food and energy insecurity, general slowdowns in the economies of nations and the perennial adverse effects of climate change.@@@I call on the global family to be intentional and fair about developing innovative development financing products that are free from the stringent restrictions and high transaction costs associated with concessionary loans.@@@Multilateral financial institutions can de-risk investments that are critical to sustainable development.@@@Aid must also be aligned with domestic development priorities.@@@The adverse effects of climate change know no borders.@@@Global warming, unpredictable weather patterns, rising sea levels and land degradation are taking a profound toll on global food and water security.@@@There are associated governance and stability costs.@@@We are informed that Africa faces disproportionate risks and costs from climate change.@@@We must therefore be consistent in meeting our commitments to all existing international frameworks for addressing climate change.@@@Beyond the usual declarations, we must collaborate on and coordinate mitigation efforts, improve infrastructure for early-warning systems, invest more in improving the management of water resources, promote disaster-risk management and enhance the conservation and protection of natural habitats.@@@There are also opportunities, especially in Africa, and Sierra Leone in particular, for just energy and rural agricultural transitions.@@@Fair and accessible multilateral climate financing can catalyse the global and country-specific measures and innovation necessary to build and support sustainable climate resilience.@@@Green investing can support sustainable development.@@@In such efforts, the roles and interests of women and young people must be central to climate investments.@@@Sierra Leone is fully committed to concluding a treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Among other things, such a treaty must prioritize conservation measures, the fair and equitable sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits, meaningful capacity development and the transfer of marine technology.@@@Human capital development is a critical driver of inclusive and sustainable economic development.@@@Sierra Leone has increased domestic financing for education, provided teaching and learning materials and improved education policies and governance.@@@More children and more girls, including pregnant girls, poorer and rural learners and learners with disabilities are now in school.@@@But we can go beyond those access deficits.@@@As co-Chair of the High-level Steering Committee on SDG 4 and a champion of the Transforming Education Summit, which just took place at the beginning of this seventy- seventh session of the Assembly, I urge for concerted global efforts to address the learning crisis.@@@We can mobilize innovative financing models, underwrite universal access, especially for girls and learners with disabilities, promote technology in education, make greater investments in foundational literacy and numeracy, address water, sanitation, hygiene and other infrastructure deficits, support school feeding programmes, fund technical and vocational training and finance other needs across the full spectrum of the education sector.@@@With close cooperation among States, we are confident that we can address the learning crisis in our time.@@@In order to address the global food crisis, which is disproportionately affecting the least developed countries, Sierra Leone joins the urgent call for action to escalate financing to support agriculture and irrigation and enhance food systems and nutrition for vulnerable populations and social protection for at-risk populations.@@@Sierra Leone also associates itself with calls to ease global supply constraints, especially on fertilizers, rice and other agricultural commodities.@@@Multilateral support for establishing agricultural development banks that will support private agricultural investments and agricultural added value chains will promote self- sufficiency and greater resilience in that sector.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that equity, multilateral cooperation and a comprehensive global response are what we need to address health emergencies that have a potential to undermine global peace, security and development.@@@Sierra Leone affirms
its commitment to global efforts aimed at exploring innovative and effective ways to enhance health security and pandemic preparedness, build capacities to respond to health emergencies and enhance greater resilience in health-care delivery.@@@Sierra Leone believes that multilateral support is urgently needed to complement national efforts aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality, preventing epidemics, tackling tropical and communicable diseases, building health-care infrastructure and the capacity of health-care personnel and strengthening primary health care.@@@Efforts to increase the domestic financing of health care should be supported with increased multilateral financing and enhanced cooperation.@@@Sierra Leone remains wholly committed to the global agenda that puts women and girls at the centre of inclusive and sustainable development.@@@We believe that we cannot deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development without the achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment.@@@We must therefore garner multilateral support to achieve and sustain gender equality and the empowerment of women in our lifetime.@@@Sexual violence is a grave threat to justice and the fundamental rights of men, women and children throughout the world.@@@In every corner of the globe, survivors of sexual assault are inhibited in holding perpetrators accountable and accessing empowering health, legal and economic remedies.@@@In Sierra Leone, we have taken extensive legislative and administrative actions to address sexual and gender-based violence since my declaration of rape as a national emergency in 2019.@@@Last year, before this Assembly, I announced that I had directed the Permanent Mission of Sierra Leone to the United Nations to sponsor at the General Assembly a stand-alone draft resolution on access to justice for survivors of sexual violence (see A/76/PV.6).@@@I called for global solidarity on the issue and for the United Nations to give all survivors of sexual violence the remedies that they deserve.@@@On 2 September, the General Assembly adopted by consensus the landmark resolution 76/304, entitled “International cooperation for access to justice, remedies and assistance for survivors of sexual violence”.@@@I thank the Assembly.@@@The General Assembly therefore affirmed the sincere and shared belief of the global community that sexual violence is condemnable, and that Member States must take effective action to address it, as well as to provide access to timely and unimpeded justice through national legislation for victims and survivors.@@@As the global community, we signalled our resolve to address that scourge.@@@We must now do all that we can to implement access to justice and other remedies to ensure dignity for all survivors of sexual violence.@@@Small States make up the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, and they are the strongest advocates for the rules-based international system that underpins the work of the United Nations.@@@Indeed, small States have served as key drafters, negotiators and thought leaders on a variety of international issues.@@@They have diligently done that through transparency of purpose and coalition-building across the board.@@@In that connection, Sierra Leone proposes further pursuing such values in the Security Council.@@@I count on the invaluable and resounding support of this organ for Sierra Leone’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term from 2024 to 2025, with elections to be held in June 2023.@@@My Government reaffirms its commitment to the relevant provision of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as contained in resolution 1514 (XV).@@@We join the call on all parties engaged in the dialogue on decolonization to continue to demonstrate good faith and a firm commitment to the conclusive and durable resolution of all sovereignty disputes.@@@As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on reform of the Security Council, I am pleased to note the commendable progress that has been achieved in the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council.@@@We believe that the progress made during the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly is underpinned by the Assembly’s acknowledgement of the wider recognition and broader support by Member States for the legitimate aspiration of African countries to play their rightful role on the global stage.@@@As Africa continues to advocate and canvass support for the African Common Position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, I urge Member States to continue to demonstrate their renewed commitment and political will to correct
the historical injustice done to Africa by supporting the reform of the Security Council so as to make it a more inclusive, democratic, transparent, accountable, legitimate and efficient global organ, which properly reflects and adequately addresses the geopolitical realities of our present and future world.@@@Sierra Leone is committed to engaging constructively within the multilateral rules-based order of the United Nations.@@@Only through global cooperation can we engender and implement transformative solutions to global challenges.@@@We live in challenging times indeed.@@@As a global community, we face the dire consequences of war, climate change, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, food insecurity and inequality.@@@The Secretary-General underlined that eloquently in his address to the General Assembly (see A/77/PV.4).@@@We have the values and principles necessary to deal with those challenges — they are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@There is no country that does not face those challenges, and we can only successfully respond to them together.@@@That is precisely why we have the United Nations, which was born out of crisis, to unite our strengths and enable nations to rise above their narrow self-interests and find common ground.@@@That is what we need to turn to again.@@@The United Nations Charter sets out clear principles for a rules-based international order, but now that rules-based order is under attack.@@@February 2022 ushered in what we had hoped we would never witness again — a new large-scale war in Europe.@@@Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine has led to massive suffering, large-scale humanitarian needs and the destruction of civilian infrastructure.@@@Russia bears sole responsibility for the war and its consequences — and Russia is responsible for bringing it to an end.@@@Russia’s actions are in blatant breach of the United Nations Charter, and therefore concern us all.@@@The war is also having devastating global consequences, as we have heard so many speakers highlight this week.@@@It has undermined multilateral cooperation when we need it the most.@@@It has accelerated a negative economic spiral and jeopardized the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We are all feeling the repercussions of the war.@@@Energy supply is under pressure, inflation is soaring and food insecurity has increased dramatically.@@@Ordinary people across the globe — not least those in developing countries — are paying the price.@@@The war is amplifying other crises and compounding the impacts of climate change and armed conflict in other parts of the world.@@@The Horn of Africa is faced with its worst drought in more than four decades.@@@Pakistan is contending with devastating floods.@@@More than 300 million people affected by conflicts and humanitarian crises are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.@@@There is a lack of respect for international humanitarian law in many armed conflicts, and civilians are paying the price.@@@A few years ago, it appeared that hunger would soon be a scourge of the past; now food insecurity is on the rise.@@@No continent is more vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change, conflict and growing food insecurity than Africa.@@@Norway stands in solidarity with the people grappling with those interlocking crises.@@@We have allocated more funding to humanitarian assistance and development cooperation in 2022 than ever before.@@@The war of aggression against Ukraine is a challenge to the norms and the founding principles of the United Nations.@@@We are standing up to confront that challenge.@@@Some have the conviction that authoritarian regimes are strong, while democracies are frail and likely to crack under pressure.@@@We are proving them wrong.@@@Together with a strong alliance of partners, we are standing with Ukraine and aiding its self-defence.@@@As Europe’s largest supplier of energy, we do what we can to enhance Europe’s resilience.@@@We are standing up for human rights and fundamental freedoms elsewhere.@@@Norway will continue to promote civic space, protect human rights defenders and support media diversity and independent journalism worldwide.@@@Women’s and girls’ participation in society and their right to make decisions about their own bodies are essential to democratic and sustainable development, not least in times of conflict and war.@@@Safeguarding those human rights remains one of our top priorities.@@@While supporting Ukraine, we must not forget conflicts elsewhere.@@@Norway is continuing its peace diplomacy and peacebuilding efforts in major conflicts across the globe.@@@As part of our long-standing engagement in the Middle East, we are pushing for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including a viable two-State solution.@@@In Colombia, the new Government has expressed its commitment to implementing the peace agreement with the Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Comun and initiating formal negotiations with the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) guerrilla group.@@@The ELN also seems inclined to renew dialogue.@@@As a guarantor country, Norway remains committed to Colombia’s quest for peace and to supporting the parties in that endeavour.@@@In all the peace processes in which Norway is engaged, we promote active involvement and participation by women in line with the women and peace and security agenda.@@@We talk to all parties as we work to achieve peaceful conflict resolution.@@@Without dialogue, we have no opportunity to influence the parties and encourage them to move in a more positive direction.@@@Norway also strongly supports the good offices of the Secretary-General in conflicts worldwide.@@@We commend him and his dedicated team for their important work on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and Tiirkiye for its important contribution.@@@The prices of food, fuel and fertilizer were already high before the war in Ukraine, but the war has dramatically exacerbated the situation.@@@If the global community does not act swiftly, the current food price crisis will develop into a food availability and food supply crisis — and that is too serious to ignore.@@@Together with fighting climate change, Norway has placed food security at the top of its development agenda.@@@This year we are allocating more than $300 million in funding to food security initiatives alone.@@@We need to increase humanitarian assistance and enhance social safety nets, promote local food production in the global South, secure access to seeds, fertilizers and technology for small-scale farmers and accelerate the transformation to climate-resilient and sustainable food systems.@@@In doing all of that, we must ensure that the needs of women and girls are adequately integrated.@@@We are all dependent on a collective response if we are to succeed in addressing climate change and the loss of biodiversity.@@@We are currently not on track, and that needs to change.@@@Norway will honour its commitment to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and play a key role in the green transition.@@@We have listened to the concerns of developing countries and have decided to double our climate financing to those countries by 2026.@@@Within that target, we aim to at least triple our funding for climate adaptation and resilience.@@@Climate change affects millions of people worldwide and increases the needs of vulnerable people.@@@However, the current humanitarian system will not be able to meet the increasing humanitarian needs.@@@As global warming continues, weather and climate extremes will increasingly have an impact on armed conflict.@@@Climate and security are already closely interlinked.@@@The fight against climate change requires new, innovative approaches, and we must do what we can to ensure the success of the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt.@@@Norway will not rest between now and then.@@@The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet brings together private and public resources with the objective of accelerating development.@@@As co-Chair, Norway will work with partners across the global South to support the initiation of renewable energy transitions, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, increase clean power and create green jobs.@@@Given our geography and our history, the oceans can — and will — be a vital part of the solution to climate change, food insecurity and poverty.@@@If adequately managed and protected, the oceans hold the key to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Yet Sustainable Development Goal 14 is the most underfunded, which is why Norway is pushing for change.@@@The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, which is co-chaired by Norway, is an initiative by world leaders committed to ocean health and ocean wealth, in support of the 2030 Agenda.@@@Panel members have committed to sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean areas under their national jurisdiction.@@@We will establish sustainable ocean plans and urge other coastal States to do the same.@@@The fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly was an important breakthrough for multilateral cooperation on environmental issues.@@@Norway will work to ensure an effective agreement on combating plastic pollution through a life-cycle approach.@@@We must not overlook existing crises as new ones emerge.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is not over yet; we cannot go from COVID-19 panic to COVID-19 neglect.@@@We must use the lessons learned from the pandemic and the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.@@@That will be key to preventing, preparing for and responding to new outbreaks of infectious disease.@@@Russia’s unlawful act of aggression against Ukraine has heightened geopolitical tensions and presented obstacles to multilateral cooperation.@@@That is serious.@@@As a Security Council member, Norway has consistently sought to strengthen the Council’s mandate to maintain international peace and security.@@@Despite increased geopolitical tensions, the Security Council has retained its ability to adopt important resolutions.@@@We secured a robust mandate for the United Nations in Afghanistan.@@@Together with the Niger, we negotiated a groundbreaking resolution on the protection of education in armed conflict (Security Council resolution 2601 (2021)), and we partnered with Ghana on a resolution on maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea (Security Council resolution 2634 (2022)).@@@All that matters.@@@In times of crisis and rising global tensions, we all feel the pressure to put domestic concerns before global solidarity.@@@In times of distress, it is only natural for political leaders to try to look after their own populations; it is their responsibility.@@@But let us remind ourselves that there is no contradiction between that and engaging with the rest of the world — quite the contrary, it is in the interests of our citizens.@@@We are bound together, we are dependent on each other and we have a shared destiny.@@@It is clear to me that, without a strong and effective United Nations, the international community will not be able to address the challenges it faces.@@@That is why we applaud and support the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@If anything, it is even more urgent to implement that report now than when it was launched.@@@The Summit of the Future, to be held in September 2024, will be an important milestone.@@@We expect, and will work towards, an ambitious declaration on future generations, and we look forward to engaging with the High-level Advisory Board and Member States in the process ahead.@@@We are living in challenging times, but let us never lose hope.@@@We must face the current challenges with resolve and recall the strength that we can muster when we act together.@@@Praise be to God the Almighty and Merciful, who has allowed
us to meet in the magnificent city of New York to participate in our Organization’s current session under the best conditions.@@@At the outset of my remarks, allow me to express my sincere thanks to the Government and the people of the United States of America, and more particularly to the people of New York, for the exemplary welcome and hospitality extended to me and my delegation.@@@I would also like to express my warm and heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his auspicious election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its seventy-seventh session.@@@Burundi, through me, assures the President of its full support and cooperation throughout his mandate in the service of humankind.@@@I would also like to express my deep gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the remarkable work he has done under extremely difficult conditions marked by the ongoing crisis resulting from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and by security crises in several regions of the world.@@@In that context, I pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary- General of the Organization, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who has spared no effort in accomplishing his mission well despite a difficult situation involving various crises and paradoxes.@@@As the Burundian adage states: “In a climate of peace, a pruning knife can serve as a lawnmower” — in other words, where there is peace, anything is possible.@@@The world today should take inspiration from this.@@@Unfortunately, the world has become an immense tower from which we witness, with tears in our eyes, gruesome acts in some nations due to war, horrible massacres, refugee flows, food insecurity and the destabilization of world economic systems.@@@The countries of the world are experiencing the knock-on effects of the situation in Ukraine.@@@In Africa, terrorism and violent extremism continue to strike in the Sahel region, the Horn of Africa and in Central Africa, with a tendency to spread to the southern region of Africa.@@@The same is true in other parts of the world — as has been noted, terrorism has no borders and climate change, which causes famine, has no limits.@@@However, together, with political will, I am confident that we can overcome these scourges.@@@I am confident because my country, Burundi, has seen all too much, with repeated political crises that have destroyed not only human lives, but also the environment.@@@Today we have recovered, and the country is well on the way to socioeconomic development.@@@Burundi is striving to make progress in this direction, using the dividends of peace, security, stability and the social cohesion that has re-emerged thanks to Burundians themselves and to the contribution of the international community.@@@We therefore hope that everyone will embrace the spirit of peace, fraternity and justice so that all the peoples of the world may fully enjoy their right to live well and in dignity.@@@On the humanitarian level, Burundi has welcomed on its soil, with warmth and dignity, thousands of refugees of all ethnicities from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Peace is a topic that is close to our hearts; its absence weighs heavily on the lives of our peoples.@@@It is in this spirit that we will never allow ourselves to shy away from implementing security decisions taken by this important, dignified international Organization, the United Nations.@@@With this in mind, Burundi continues to fight tooth and nail to contribute to the return of peace in countries in which it has been disrupted, in the framework of the United Nations, the African Union or the region.@@@Our interventions in Somalia and the Central African Republic are testimony to this.@@@Similarly, Burundi is committed to contributing to the return of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the framework of the East African Community initiative.@@@I take this opportunity to ask the international community to support the Nairobi process to help the Congolese people in distress.@@@With further regard to peace and security, by participating in this meeting, I am led to humbly request the involvement of the United Nations in tracking down the terrorist groups that are beginning to infiltrate our subregion, not to mention those already active in other parts of the world.@@@The East African Community, of which Burundi holds the presidency, has just welcomed a new member, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and, together with the other heads of State of the member countries, we have set ourselves the goal of stabilizing the entire community, so that our countries’ populations can finally focus on socioeconomic development projects.@@@That is why the Government of Burundi is developing transport infrastructure, including road, rail, air and water transport, in order to achieve the interconnected, multimodal approach at the national and subregional levels that is imperative for my country.@@@Burundi is working closely with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Republic of Tanzania to achieve the ambitious Uvinza-Musongati- Gitega-Bujumbura-Uvira-Kindu railroad project that
will link the three countries, as well as the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.@@@This megaproject will not only boost the economies of the three countries, but will also facilitate the movement of goods and people in the subregion.@@@We would like the States Members of the United Nations to stand as one to protect and promote all the rights that humankind must enjoy without distinction.@@@While we appreciate what is already being done, work remains to be done in order for people to fully exercise all the rights to which they are entitled as human beings.@@@I would therefore like to take this opportunity to warmly thank the international community for its efforts to restore peace and stability in my country.@@@In that regard, I should like to inform this august Assembly that equitable justice for all is today a reality, and that human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of the press, are respected throughout Burundi.@@@Unfortunately, however, some officials, under the banner of some of the Organization’s entities, are discouraging this positive development by politicizing democracy and the fight against impunity.@@@In some countries, including my own, when democracy, as defined, takes root, some United Nations officials distort that democracy, calling it untrustworthy and non-inclusive to perpetuate unnecessary tensions.@@@Whereas we fight on a daily basis against impunity, some of these officials still seek to disqualify our actions.@@@It is therefore high time that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights align itself with our countries to enable a common understanding of the direction of our countries’ policies, instead of trying to control their actions at a distance through committees and offices of special rapporteurs.@@@The time has come for the United Nations to recognize the progress made by my country over the past 17 years and to understand that the status of “fragile country” no longer applies to Burundi.@@@People are at the heart of the economy, from the family to the global level.@@@We must therefore contribute to the development of human capital by providing our peoples with appropriate tools, experience and knowledge adapted to the demands of contemporary life.@@@We must find solutions to counter the threats to our economy, health, education system and peaceful coexistence — in short, threats to our way of life within our countries and among the countries of the world.@@@We know that the United Nations seeks to improve the living conditions of the world’s population through access to sufficient household income to ensure a decent standard of living.@@@Education is a key element in achieving that.@@@In terms of education, I could not be more explicit than Nelson Mandela when he said: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”@@@So many years after this famous line was spoken, this idea for effecting positive change in our communities remains relevant.@@@Education creates aspirations and ambitions for the future in young people and is an effective tool in the fight against violence and terrorism.@@@That is why, in my country, we are initiating reforms that rethink policy regarding the education system in order to turn our youth into members of, rather than tributaries to, the public service.@@@We are pleased to note that, in my country, making education free has significantly increased enthusiasm towards school among girls and boys alike and that the dropout rate in elementary grades, which is often linked to food insufficiency, distance from schools and inability to afford school fees, has decreased significantly.@@@In order to turn youth into agents of peace and inclusive development in Burundi, we have put in place an ambitious programme of youth economic empowerment and employment with the aim of reducing unemployment by creating jobs for young people through entrepreneurship.@@@Alongside this programme, we have set up a youth investment bank and an accelerator, guarantee and support fund to facilitate access to credit.@@@The same is true for women, who account for a high percentage of Burundian youth.@@@We have established a women’s investment bank and are pursuing reforms to improve women’s health and education.@@@The Office of the First Lady of Burundi has opened a hospital to treat obstetric fistulas and, together with Burundi’s development partners, continues to innovate to greatly improve the lives of Burundian women.@@@Meanwhile, managing the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent task.@@@To that end, I would like to make a strong appeal to all development partners of the African continent to take courageous measures to support the economies of African States, which have been hard hit by the various current crises.@@@As no country in the world was created with the idea of forever receiving assistance, this support should be done through mutually beneficial strategic partnerships focused on, among others, investment, trade promotion and technology transfers.@@@In order to develop human capital and to make the population dynamic and productive, my Government is providing each commune with at least one hospital and health centres to prevent and treat diseases, including from epidemics and pandemics.@@@While we are proud of having been able to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the fight continues.@@@Furthermore, free health care has been provided for children under five years of age and pregnant women who give birth in public hospitals and health centres, which has significantly reduced infant mortality.@@@The efforts aimed at my country’s economic development must primarily focus on developing the agricultural sector.@@@To that end, my Government has declared 2022 as “Year of Agriculture in Burundi” under the general theme “Agriculture, source of the national economy”.@@@Our agricultural development programme is all about changing mindsets and practices.@@@We are encouraging the population to aim higher by producing not only for local consumption but also, and especially, for export, to join forces to work together in agricultural cooperatives and to progressively replace hoes with modern tools and agricultural technologies.@@@Concerning the environment, Burundi has not remained idle, especially since we have experienced drought in some regions, the flooding of rivers and lakes and landslides that sometimes carry away human lives, houses and crops, thus leading to food insufficiency.@@@In the light of this, Burundi has joined the global consensus by carrying out environmental protection, conservation and management works through various activities throughout the country.@@@Furthermore, Burundi is learning about climate change resilience, not only through the practice of hill irrigation but also through soil protection efforts, such as the drawing of contour lines and generalized reforestation, under the government project entitled “Ewe Burundi urambaye”, or “Covering Burundi”.@@@Every Thursday is dedicated to this purpose throughout the country.@@@We must also ensure that we progressively develop the infrastructure, in particular energy and transport, to support production and better ensure the growth of other sectors that drive growth and employment.@@@The Government of Burundi is working on a huge project to develop the energy sector by mobilizing resources through co-financing and private-sector investment.@@@The aim is to develop the potential of hydroelectricity, solar energy, peat, geothermal resources and municipal waste.@@@The two sectors I have just highlighted also provide crucial support for the exploitation of mining potential.@@@We want to forge a mutually advantageous and balanced technical and financial partnership in the exploration, exploitation and processing of mining and geological products, as surveys have revealed a subsoil that is very rich and as yet untouched.@@@For peace and development to become reality, we have to prioritize good governance and the sound management of public finances, which not only helps to relieve the people’s frustrations, which are at the root of social conflicts, but also enables us to plan the national economy properly.@@@I want to point out that we have strong national mechanisms for combating corruption and related activities.@@@Acts of corruption are dealt with effectively and our citizens are satisfied with our performance in this area.@@@In terms of economic activity, Burundi is on the right track, leveraging mining resources as well as road, sea and, soon, rail transport routes for economic actors.@@@Investors should know that the Lake Tanganyika shoreline is being developed for tourism and new tourist sites are being created in the interior of the country.@@@Before concluding my remarks, I would like to once again reaffirm my country’s determination to maintain good diplomatic relations and mutually beneficial, win-win cooperation with all States and international organizations in order to confront the fundamental challenges that are a threat to us all.@@@We welcome our resumption of good political, diplomatic and economic relations that had previously been frozen with various States and international organizations.@@@Our ardent wish is to maintain strong relations with States and international organizations towards a bright future for Burundi and every country in the world.@@@I warmly congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election and wish him every success.@@@I also pay tribute to and congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Abdullah Shahid, for his commitment during the seventy-sixth session.@@@I reiterate my country’s full support to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as he serves our Organization.@@@I am delighted once again to speak in earnest, for the situation demands just that.@@@Indeed, the international system is at a critical juncture as the world struggles to recover from a pandemic and remains in the clutches of a multidimensional crisis.@@@The emergence of new centres of influence results in entrenched positions and demands that we prioritize ongoing dialogue, instead of power struggles, to reach global consensus in addressing controversial issues within the multilateral system.@@@In the light of the rivalry among Powers and the multifaceted challenges that affect us all, it would be dangerously naive to continue focusing on power struggles or unilateral positions.@@@The interconnected nature of global issues and national economies compels us to engage in dialogue in order to respond appropriately and above all collectively to the most serious threats to international peace and security.@@@We are in the last quarter of a year of increasingly difficult global challenges that have thwarted common and individual efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@With fewer than eight years left until the deadline for reaching those goals, it is crucial that we assess our progress in the light of the ongoing threat posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic to our economies.@@@A threat just as insidious now looms over our economies: inflation.@@@Around the world, it is reaching tragic record levels.@@@No one is spared — neither businesses nor households, neither the North nor the South.@@@Its effects are devastating.@@@As such, we must take action.@@@Of course, we must take individual action, which is precisely what Gabon is doing by subsidizing certain commodities and controlling the price of others.@@@Nonetheless, it that regard too, we will be successful in overcoming that problem only if we take collective action in a coordinated manner and in solidarity with each other.@@@It is yet another challenge the world must face.@@@We must all meet that challenge together.@@@This year marks many new beginnings for Gabon, as we arise from the tragedy and forced inertia of the coronavirus disease pandemic and reopen to the world.@@@We are the newest member of the Commonwealth of Nations, which is home to 2.5 billion people — one third of the world’s population — with shared values of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.@@@My country is broadening the horizons of its citizens and seizing the chance for our young people to benefit by studying, travelling and building business relationships far beyond our own borders.@@@At the same time, Gabon takes its place on the world stage — not alone but as a proud African nation.@@@However, the problems that our world faces today are global, as are the solutions.@@@We must all be outward-facing, not inward-looking, as we confront the difficulties of a world in which resources are finite and populations are growing.@@@This month, our Commonwealth family lost its leader — Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.@@@Through the union that she loved so deeply, the Queen offered respect, friendship and wise counsel to many independent nations around the world, small or large.@@@She promoted peace, liberty and shared values and fostered a spirit of cooperation.@@@As the new Head of the Commonwealth, His Majesty King Charles III can be assured of my full support and that of the Gabonese people.@@@As a dear friend of Gabon for many years, King Charles III shares my enthusiasm for protecting our natural environment and biodiversity and my concerns about global climate and sustainability.@@@Fifty years after the Stockholm Conference, humankind faces an unprecedented triple environmental crisis — climate change, the biodiversity extinction crisis and pollution, notably by plastics.@@@First, with regard to climate change, thanks to its 88 per cent forest cover and a rate of deforestation well below 0.1 per cent, Gabon is an exemplary high- forest, low-deforestation country.@@@Since the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in Copenhagen in 2009, Gabon has net absorbed more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide.@@@We absorb more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year.@@@In other words, we have already achieved and indeed have exceeded the Paris Agreement on Climate Change objective of carbon neutrality.@@@We are counting on the creation of a net carbon sequestration market to enable us to maintain that performance through 2050 and beyond.@@@Secondly, I find the biodiversity crisis extremely alarming.@@@The fifteenth COP to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, to be held in Montreal, will be a decisive moment for humankind, and it is critical that we adopt an ambitious global biodiversity framework.@@@The time has come to transition from billions to trillions by mobilizing 1 per cent of global gross domestic product to benefit the natural environment.@@@Thirdly, pollution has become a chronic problem for our cities, rivers and oceans.@@@We must waste no time in adopting a binding international agreement on plastic pollution, as well as a treaty of the high seas.@@@To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, our international agreements and national policies must address the interdependence of those crises.@@@Threats to international peace and security continue to increase exponentially.@@@Faced with the proliferation of armed groups, restricting their access to arms will be at the heart of my country’s priorities during its presidency of the Security Council in October.@@@In that regard, I would like to reiterate my country’s call for a robust partnership to ensure greater security in the Gulf of Guinea.@@@Many countries face humanitarian crises that are exacerbated by armed conflict.@@@That is the case in Ukraine, where the war has led to a worsening of the situation in countries and regions that were already experiencing food shortages.@@@That is why my country has clearly expressed its opposition not only to that bloody war but to any form of war.@@@Gabon, which has never experienced armed conflict, will continue to advocate and favour dialogue and negotiation over confrontation.@@@Access to education for children should be considered sacred.@@@Therefore, I would like to express my country’s resolute support for the sanctuarization of schools and places of education, particularly during armed conflicts.@@@To compromise education is to place a mortgage on future generations.@@@It is in that vein that I have made the promotion of women and young people a key priority.@@@In 2015, I launched the Decade of the Gabonese Woman, which aims to reserve a place of choice for women and children in all aspects of governance in Gabon.@@@Internationalism is at a turning point.@@@We need to reform the United Nations to ensure better consideration of the aspirations of Africa.@@@That is particularly applicable to the Security Council, where Africa’s role needs to be consolidated.@@@Africa has waited long enough, and we will not wait any longer.@@@In the light of the strong interdependence of nations, it is crucial that we put an end to the use of sanctions, while working instead to build bridges of prosperity.@@@As such, I call once again for the total lifting of the embargo that has affected the Government and the people of Cuba for several decades.@@@Inevitably, the principal victims of any embargo are the weak and the vulnerable.@@@In the Middle East, Gabon has always believed that the two-State solution is the only way to achieve peace and security.@@@It is the responsibility of our generation to resolve that problem.@@@In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Gabon’s commitment to the principles and values of solidarity at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@To that end, I reiterate my country’s solemn appeal to all members of the international community to live up to their shared commitments in order to ensure peace, security and dignity for the peoples of the world.@@@In Senegal last December, I met doctors and researchers who are passionate and determined to save lives, and it is thanks to international cooperation that, at the Institut Pasteur, they have created a vaccine-production centre equipped with the most promising technologies.@@@A few months later, in Borodyanka, Ukraine, I met children.@@@I saw the horror of war in their eyes, heard stories of violence against women, rape, torture, mass graves and
the sowers of death.@@@I saw hope in Dakar and horror in Borodyanka.@@@To put an end to horror and choose hope: this is the promise of the United Nations, and this is what the European Union was founded upon.@@@That is what we want — hope — for the whole world.@@@For this, the European Union reaches out to all those who want to cooperate for the common good and honour the promise of the United Nations.@@@I will speak of hope, but first I must talk — alas — about a war.@@@Every war is a denial of humanity, and all suffering deserves the same commitment from us, whether in Yemen, Ethiopia, the Sahel, Myanmar or Ukraine.@@@The Kremlin launched a war against the Ukrainian people.@@@And hundreds of millions of women, men and children all over the world are being targeted, threatened by famine, deprived of heating or burdened by energy bills.@@@The Kremlin is waging a hybrid war that combines the violence of weapons with the poison of lies.@@@Russia claims that its security has been threatened for years by “the West”.@@@That is false.@@@The Kremlin is attempting — in vain, I hope — to mobilize the rest of the world against an imaginary enemy.@@@Absolutely nobody has threatened, attacked or invaded Russia.@@@And no one in Europe wanted a conflict with Russia.@@@What interest would we have in jeopardizing the security and prosperity of all?@@@The second lie is that this war, according to Russia, seeks to prevent an alleged genocide of the Russian- speaking population of Ukraine and to “denazify” the country.@@@That is false, and it is despicable.@@@Genocide is the concrete, intentional elimination — total or partial — of a national, ethnic or religious group.@@@Are we to believe that today nobody, apart from the Kremlin, would have noticed the large-scale massacre of Ukrainians by Ukrainians?@@@And what kind of liberation leads to the killing of Russian speakers and the destruction of their cities’ infrastructure?@@@Finally, the third lie is that the aggression against Ukraine, Russia claims, is a “special operation” — not a war.@@@That is false and insulting.@@@It is in fact a war.@@@And the mobilization, announced a few days ago, of hundreds of thousands of reservists only confirms that.@@@Banning the term “war” by punishing its use with up to 15 years of prison does not change its nature; it merely betrays its shameful character.@@@This war is an unprovoked, illegal and unjustified aggression that seeks to change internationally recognized borders by force, and that is unacceptable.@@@And because we must
stop the Kremlin’s war machine, massive economic sanctions were unavoidable.@@@That brings me to the fourth lie — that sanctions are causing food and fertilizer shortages.@@@That is false.@@@It was Russia that, even before the war, unilaterally decided to drastically reduce its exports of grain and fertilizers, causing price volatility on the global market.@@@It was Russia that then decided to place a military blockade on the Black Sea ports, making maritime trade impossible.@@@It was the European Union that opened the “solidarity lanes”, which have already allowed millions of tons of food products to leave Ukraine by land.@@@And it was the agreement reached by Secretary-General Guterres that opened a maritime corridor in the Black Sea in order to help reduce global prices and start the resupply of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.@@@Today it is the height of cynicism that the Kremlin is again threatening not to extend the agreement concluded with the United Nations.@@@Once again, it is the most vulnerable countries that will be the main victims.@@@In fact, there is a simple solution to stop the food crisis — Russia must stop the war, withdraw from Ukrainian territory and lift its blockade of ports.@@@One moment of truth stands out in this web of lies: one year ago, in a written and issued statement, Vladimir Putin declared — on the basis of wild historical imaginings — that Ukraine is neither a nation nor a legitimate State.@@@That is what is behind his thinking.@@@Nobody is fooled, and sham referendums will not change a thing.@@@In 1963, at the founding of the Organization of African Unity, in Addis Ababa, Modibo Keita, the first President of independent Mali, said that:
“imperialism is the manifestation of domination of one man over another, of one society over another, of one people over another, and the desire to impose — at all costs — one’s own way of thinking, way of life and method of political and economic development on others.”
Imperialism and revanchism are the foundations of this war of colonization, which targets Ukraine and is deliberately flouting international law and the Charter of the United Nations — to the point of threatening the use of nuclear weapons and using, at this very moment, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe as a military base.@@@That must stop; it is unacceptable.@@@We unreservedly support the efforts of Mr. Rafael Grossi,
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to restore security at the Zaporizhzhya plant.@@@I stand here in front of the General Assembly at this rostrum to say, solemnly, that the European Union is not asking anyone to choose between East or West, North or South.@@@But there is a choice to be made.@@@And the European Union chooses respect for borders over aggression, cooperation over threats and the rules- based order over the law of the strongest.@@@In 1948, at this rostrum, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, Belgian Prime Minister Paul- Henri Spaak, addressed the Soviet Union directly:
“[we were] afraid because, within the Assembly, the USSR had risen as the champion of the doctrine of absolute national sovereignty, and [we] were wondering how an international organization could function and achieve its aims if that outdated and reactionary doctrine were to triumph.”@@@(A/PV.147; p. 281)@@@Today Russia is scary.@@@The Kremlin brought war back to Europe and is engaging in blackmail.@@@We cannot let the destructive action of one of us shake our collective determination to act for the common good.@@@The European Union is reaching out, sincerely and honestly.@@@We have so many challenges to face together.@@@The effects of the pandemic are painful, especially for the most vulnerable.@@@The Human Development Index is falling.@@@All too often, the rights of women and minorities are still too often flouted, or their very existence is denied.@@@Extreme natural phenomena are becoming increasingly frequent, as we saw recently and tragically in Pakistan and Nigeria.@@@Fissures are widening between developed and developing countries and between democracies and authoritarian regimes.@@@Fissures are also widening within each of our various countries.@@@Multilateral cooperation is collective intelligence in action.@@@It is also the DNA of the European Union, which works as a force for peace, development and the promotion of human rights.@@@European leadership aims to build solutions together.@@@We are not here to lecture.@@@There is no master and no pupil.@@@It is that spirit of cooperation that guides our action in the United Nations, in the Group of Seven (G-7) and in the Group of 20 (G-20).@@@And that is why we are reaching out, with that spirit, that we are reaching out to form strategic partnerships.@@@Together with our African brothers, we have reset the parameters.@@@Our partnership is forward-looking and truly on an equal footing.@@@I reiterate here my call and support for the inclusion of the African Union in the G-20.@@@We share so much with Japan and South Korea, for example, and we are strengthening our relationship day by day.@@@With India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we are expanding our areas of cooperation.@@@Our ties with the Latin American continent are natural ones, and we are relying heavily on next year’s summit to give new impetus to our relationship.@@@With the Gulf countries, we are identifying our common priorities and conducting frank and regular dialogues on our differences.@@@We hope that emerging Powers, including China, will participate in earnest in collective efforts for peace and development.@@@We believe in maritime security.@@@We believe in stability in the Taiwan Strait.@@@We adhere to the one-China policy, but we will not turn a blind eye to human rights abuses, especially in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.@@@We are in this forum, the United Nations, which brings together the peoples of the world, and we all know that a robust multilateral system requires mutual trust.@@@However, the current system is not inclusive or representative enough.@@@The use of the veto should be the exception, but it is becoming the rule.@@@Reform is urgently needed.@@@I will share with the Assembly my conviction that, when a permanent member of the Security Council starts an unprovoked and unjustifiable war that is condemned by the General Assembly, that member ought to be automatically suspended from the Security Council.@@@We support the Secretary-General’s proposals on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@The 2024 Summit of the Future must be seized as an opportunity to make those radical improvements.@@@The European Union is committed to, and stands by, the countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel.@@@We are also prepared to develop resources for the countries of the Gulf of Guinea.@@@We are also committed to Mozambique.@@@We support the efforts of Rwanda and the countries of the Southern African Development Community, which are present today.@@@With our High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union is sparing no effort to implement the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear issue.@@@The European Union stands by the Afghan people, especially Afghan women.@@@We will continue to fight everywhere this obscurantism, which tramples on the rights of women and girls on a daily basis in all areas.@@@And I am thinking now of the Iranian women and girls who are courageously risking their lives and standing up for their dignity.@@@In Yemen, a serious humanitarian crisis is unfolding.@@@The Yemeni people have a right to peace.@@@We support the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Grundberg to transform the current truce into a sustainable ceasefire.@@@The peace agreements between Arab countries and Israel are a step forward in the region.@@@But the Palestinian people have waited too long in vain for the slightest progress for their own future.@@@They cannot be forgotten in the global landscape.@@@The two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living in peaceful coexistence and security, is a priority.@@@Finally, I am personally engaged in a difficult mediation between the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia.@@@The fighting must stop, with a view to resolving the conflict in order to establish lasting peace and prosperity to the South Caucasus.@@@Leadership is about showing the way and delivering results.@@@When it comes to energy security, we have been too dependent for too long — putting our security, prosperity and sovereignty at risk.@@@Energy and climate change are two sides of the same coin.@@@To overcome the energy crisis is to reduce the climate threat, and to protect our biodiversity and our oceans is to secure our future.@@@Climate neutrality is the compass of the European Union.@@@At the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Sharm El-Sheikh, we will push urgently to implement the promises of Paris and to go beyond.@@@We want a fair and just transition.@@@No one country alone can protect our planet.@@@The European Union is honouring its commitment to developing countries, and we hope that the other developed countries follow our example.@@@Today nearly one fifth of humankind is at risk of sliding into poverty and hunger.@@@The Russian war on Ukraine has exacerbated that crisis.@@@Initiatives are being taken by the G-7, the European Union, the
African Union and others.@@@The European Union is mobilizing nearly €8 billion for food security between now and 2024.@@@But we know that more is needed — more coordination, more money and more sovereignty.@@@New, more resilient and fairer agricultural models are needed.@@@More food sovereignty, especially in Africa and Latin America, is indispensable.@@@We are ready to support sustainable projects for fertilizer production on those continents, following the example of what is being done for vaccines to protect against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).@@@COVID-19 has opened our eyes to our strengths and weaknesses.@@@Vaccines were produced in record time.@@@And under the leadership of the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, a balance was struck between intellectual property, scientific innovation and universal access to technology.@@@Nevertheless, we know that we must fully learn the lessons from this painful pandemic.@@@That is why Mr. Ghebreyesus and I, some time ago, launched the idea of a pandemic treaty to strengthen global health security.@@@Negotiations on the treaty are ongoing and must be concluded.@@@In conclusion, we know that this is a pivotal moment in human history.@@@The term “pivotal” has been overused perhaps, but now, more than ever, we sense that the times we are living through are not ordinary or insignificant.@@@And I think of Winston Churchill, who, in 1946, referring to the failure of the League of Nations to avert the Second World War, he said:
“The League did not fail because of its principles or conceptions.@@@It failed because those principles were deserted by those States which brought it into being, because the Governments of those States feared to face the facts and act while time remained.”@@@Like the European Union, the United Nations is a project of hope, founded in the wake of the horrors of two World Wars.@@@A few days ago, my 6-year-old daughter suddenly confided in her mother and me that she is afraid of war.@@@And that sent shivers down my spine.@@@No parent in the world can bear to have their child afraid of war, let alone have to face it.@@@No parent in the world can bear for their child to be hungry or unable to receive medical treatment.@@@No parent in the world can bear their child being deprived of hope of a dignified and fulfilling life.@@@Preventing or stopping the horror in Borodyanka, Yemen, Myanmar and elsewhere; restoring hope, like the doctors in Dakar and elsewhere, is the heart of our responsibility as leaders representing the peoples of the world.@@@We have many differences, but beyond our differences the same blood runs through our veins.@@@The same hearts beat within.@@@And we share the same dreams of education and freedom for our boys and girls.@@@I believe in the virtues of collective wisdom.@@@I believe that science and knowledge will put the world back on the track of hope.@@@We need a wake-up call.@@@That must happen now, and we must act together.@@@The world can count on the European Union.@@@I would like to begin by expressing my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I am confident that your vast experience, deep knowledge of the United Nations system and well-known commitment to multilateral diplomacy will ensure the success of your mandate.@@@I also want to assure you of the full support of the delegation of Burkina Faso in your exercise of your burdensome duty and in the success of our work.@@@My congratulations also go to your predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his admirable stewardship of the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@And I solemnly reaffirm Burkina Faso’s gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his constant, resolute and renewed commitment to peace and security and development.@@@I would like to take the opportunity today in this Hall to welcome the holding of the Transforming Education Summit, which has enabled a broad mobilization of actors in the education arena.@@@I dare to hope that the global commitment to the implementation of the Summit’s conclusions will contribute significantly to accelerating progress towards achieving quality education for all, particularly in the countries of the South.@@@The theme of the General Assembly at this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, aptly highlights the urgency and the historic responsibility borne by the political, economic and social actors of our time in the face of the multiple crises facing our planet.@@@While the world is gradually recovering from the coronavirus disease pandemic, other scourges — such as terrorism, intra- and inter-State conflicts and the humanitarian and food security crises they engender, along with climate change and its perverse effects — continue to blight daily life across the world.@@@They serve as a reminder that we are fragile, individually and collectively, that countries and peoples are interdependent, and that international solidarity is urgently needed.@@@If we want
to save humankind from collective and inescapable peril, we must not ignore that reminder.@@@The end of the Cold War gave us an opportunity to dream and to aspire to a world based on consensus, with a focus on the core values of peace, justice, freedom, democracy and solidarity.@@@But that dream was an illusion, because for some time now we have unfortunately been seeing nationalism and inward-looking attitudes resurgent in certain parts of the planet, while freedom and democracy are shrinking in others.@@@We have seen the readiness of certain countries to impose their world view on others.@@@And we are seeing games of rivalry and confrontation play out between Powers as they vie for the political, military or economic control of certain parts of the world.@@@Simply put, actors in the international community have been brazenly spreading a unipolar and monochromatic world view that reflects their own ideology and interests.@@@We urgently need to regroup and develop the inner strength to refrain from succumbing to those temptations.@@@Let us instead emphasize a spirit of solidarity that is aimed at preserving our world’s diversity and realizing the principle of the interdependence of peoples, a world in which everyone can contribute to managing its affairs.@@@Burkina Faso firmly believes that humankind’s chance of survival lies in accepting our differences and diversity and using them resourcefully.@@@Far from being a source of antagonism or hostility, our differences and diversity represent an excellent opportunity to find complementarity and solidarity — a way of encouraging peaceful coexistence and sustainable development that costs us nothing.@@@The key challenges facing our world today are well known to everyone.@@@They include primarily peace and security, democracy and sustainable development, climate change and environment and health and education.@@@I want to emphasize that the only way we can meet those challenges is by working together.@@@That is why we must try to extend our concerns beyond our individual and private interests, which are often factors in crises, in order to maintain peaceful relations with one another.@@@I therefore call earnestly on all the actors of the international community, whether they are from the North or the South and regardless of the political, economic or military power they have, to take that approach.@@@Certain issues have recurred on the General Assembly’s plenary agenda for several years now, including Palestine, the Western Sahara, debt, climate change, the embargo on Cuba, the war in Ukraine and Security Council reform.@@@In order to resolve each of those issues, on behalf of Burkina Faso I strongly recommend that we respected the rule of law, champion justice and equity and let common sense lead the way.@@@I would now like to say a few words about the situation in my country and the aim of the political transition currently under way, in connection with the General Assembly’s very relevant theme this session and the goals of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@On 24 January, a group of young patriots felt compelled to take responsibility for the public management of the nation’s affairs in a natural response to a drift in political governance, growing insecurity in our country and the gradual and continuing disintegration of the State, and they did so by putting an end to a regime that while democratically elected was also mired in chaos.@@@But we have no intention of justifying or promoting destabilizing practices or violating the constitutional order.@@@While the 24 January movement was technically illegal and perhaps contrary to principles dear to the United Nations and the international community as a whole, when we consider how things were being handled we believe it was necessary, indeed vital, to disrupt the constitutional order.@@@It was a matter of our nation’s survival above all.@@@That is why the movement, which is focused on safeguarding the territory and implementing reforms, enjoys genuine popular legitimacy among public opinion in our country, and that enthusiasm and popular support have continued for the transitional authorities, which I have been leading for eight months now.@@@The security situation in Burkina Faso began to deteriorate in 2015, before reaching a low point in 2020 and 2021.@@@The recent events that disrupted my country’s march towards democracy have resulted from a failure to respond appropriately to the security crisis, as well as terrible political governance, which among other things led to the largest number of internally displaced persons in the political history of our country and subregion — 1,520,012 people as of 31 August.@@@We are also facing a humanitarian and food crisis unprecedented in the country’s history, as well as the closure of several thousand schools, with half a million students deprived of education, and economic stagnation induced by the slowdown, if not total halt, in economic activity in a number of industries such as mining, tourism and hotels, as well as agriculture
and livestock farming and transportation.@@@Those difficulties, which I have touched on briefly, are part of a wider subregional security context of attacks perpetrated by various terrorist groups operating in the Sahel, particularly in its centre, which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger.@@@Nevertheless, in order to deal with this, the transitional Government, relying largely on new internal initiatives, has shouldered its responsibilities by developing an action plan based on four strategic objectives — combating terrorism and restoring territorial integrity, responding to the humanitarian crisis, rebuilding the State and improving governance and ensuring national reconciliation and social cohesion.@@@In order to achieve those objectives, we have launched some major initiatives.@@@The first is to restructure our national security apparatus and to take firm and vigorous action on the ground to combat terrorism and armed groups.@@@The second is to combat radicalization, hate speech and the stigmatization of communities.@@@The third is to implement a policy of de-radicalization and social and professional reintegration for reformed combatants from armed groups.@@@The fourth is to support the resettlement and socioeconomic integration of internally displaced persons and those affected by terrorism.@@@Lastly, we aim to combat corruption and promote justice, equity and education for peace and for our citizens.@@@However, Burkina Faso’s will and determination alone in combating terrorism will not be enough to make a long-lasting impact.@@@The support of the international community is both crucial and expected, and it is particularly urgent for Burkina Faso, whose geographic position makes it a buffer zone for curbing the spread of terrorism to countries on the coast such as Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo.@@@Ensuring stability, security and peace in the Sahel is not just a matter of concern for the countries of our region because the current situation in the Sahel countries, needless to say, is the result of terrorism’s migration from North Africa towards the South.@@@The current situation in the Sahel, a result of that cross-border impact, is a problem that is jeopardizing international peace and security.@@@It is therefore important for the international community to understand it better and be more involved.@@@The efforts that have been made so far are certainly welcome, but they fall short of what is needed, given the reality on the ground.@@@In that context, I welcome the initiative that the Chairperson of the African Union and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have taken to mandate the former President of the Niger Mahamadou Issoufou to lead the joint African Union-United Nations Independent High-Level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, which should produce recommendations on how to strengthen the international response to the security crisis in the Sahel with a view to finding a comprehensive and lasting solution.@@@I appeal to our bilateral and multilateral technical and financial partners to support the transition action plan we adopted on 6 May.@@@Burkina Faso is hoping for their support in order to close a gap of approximately $4.5 billion out of a total budget of about $18 billion.@@@The Government has also begun developing an emergency transition programme, which will be devoted to priority projects, as well as innovative projects and others expected to significantly benefit people’s living conditions.@@@We are therefore counting on our friends and partners to mobilize support to that end.@@@The transition authorities in Burkina Faso are aware of their responsibilities to our people and their duty to the international community, and I want to make it clear that we will not abandon those responsibilities.@@@In that regard, on 3 July we agreed to a dynamic compromise with the Economic Community of West African States on the duration of the transition, which was set at 24 months from 1 July, and on the need to set up a transitional monitoring and evaluation mechanism based on indicators relating to security, the restoration of Government services to the occupied areas and the return of displaced persons.@@@I firmly believe that achieving significant progress in those three areas will help create the conditions for holding credible and transparent elections with a view to a return to a normal constitutional order.@@@Such progress can be achieved only with the substantial support of the international community, for which I urge wholeheartedly from this rostrum today.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our bilateral, multilateral and private technical and financial partners who are supporting us or have promised to do so.@@@I would also like to invite those that have not yet done so to join us and support us as we strive to rebuild and strengthen the economic, social and security fabric of the country.@@@The peoples of our planet, rich or poor, powerful or weak, need a secure and peaceful world in which all can live in peace and fully exercise their rights.@@@The Sahel is currently riddled with armed groups that are causing devastation all over the globe.@@@They threaten the security both of the region and the rest of the world.@@@If nothing is decisively and urgently done to help our countries, we may see terrorism flare up in the countries of the Gulf of Guinea and then the rest of the world — starting with Europe, the continent closest to Africa.@@@Nor will any precautionary or preventive measure be able to prevent terrorism from spreading to the other side of the Atlantic if the Sahel is left to its fate.@@@And as long as the young people of the Sahel and neighbouring countries no longer have hope in their own lands, nothing will be able to prevent them from attempting the perilous migration to Europe via the Sahara and the Mediterranean.@@@Against the backdrop of terrorism-inflicted misery in the region, the Sahel has become a stage for futile rivalries and shameful greed, which make the situation even worse.@@@The countries of the Sahel deserve better than this and need solidarity and help — but not just any help.@@@We need help that enables us to no longer ask for help — the kind that will make our need for help obsolete.@@@And we need it to be consistent with our beliefs and to respect our dignity.@@@I would like to conclude my remarks by urging all the actors of the international community to show greater solidarity with one another, because that is the best way to address the challenges of our time and preserve the interests of all.@@@Raoul Follereau said that no one has the right to be happy all by themselves.@@@Let us therefore make sure that there are no more malnourished children without education or instruction; that there are no more young people without training or jobs; that there are no more peasants without land to live in dignity; that there are no more workers whose rights are trampled; that the abundance of some is not the cause of the destitution of others; that force does not prevail over truth and justice; and finally, that the reasons of our selfishness never prevail over the demands of the dignity of humankind and peoples.@@@I vow that Burkina Faso will spare no effort to make its contribution to the building of a better, peaceful, united and prosperous world.@@@I offer my sincere congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Shahid for his good stewardship of the previous session and for all his efforts in that regard.@@@I would like as well to commend His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his continued efforts to promote the role of the United Nations Organization and develop its work.@@@The world today is in a very delicate situation, involving armed conflicts and interrelated crises that are of concern to us all.@@@There is no better place to deliberate those challenges than in the General Assembly Hall, which brings together all the world’s States under the auspices of the Charter of the United Nations, which my country, Lebanon, is proud to have played a role in establishing.@@@We have enjoyed decades of productive cooperation with the United Nations.@@@In that context, I am delighted to thank the President of the General Assembly — and through him, the United Nations, with all its branches and specialized institutions and those operating in Lebanon — for their efforts to help Lebanon and contribute to mitigating the consequences of the crippling economic and financial crisis that it now faces.@@@I would like to thank in particular the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for its sacrifices and efforts to maintain stability in southern Lebanon, in close coordination with the Lebanese army.@@@With the help of Member States, we look forward to strengthening the military capabilities and alleviating the financial burdens of the Lebanese army.@@@In that context, we stress Lebanon’s commitment to the full implementation of the provisions of resolution 1701 (2006) and all resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@With regard to the demarcation of our maritime borders, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the commendable mediation of the United States, I would like to reaffirm Lebanon’s full commitment to its sovereignty and rights over, and its enjoyment of, its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.@@@We reiterate our sincere desire to reach a long- overdue negotiated solution.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly that we have made significant progress in that regard and hope to soon reach the desired outcome.@@@Lebanon is determined to protect its national interests and the wealth of its people, as well as to invest in its national resources.@@@We are fully aware of the importance of the promising energy market in the eastern Mediterranean for the prosperity of the economies of the countries of the region and for meeting the needs of importing countries.@@@Lebanon believes in the leading role played by the United Nations.@@@We stress our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@We also believe in the international frameworks that address disarmament issues in their various forms and welcome efforts to establish an international understanding to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction pursuant to decision 73/546.@@@We commend the previous sessions of the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear
Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction and look forward to the successful conclusion of its third session, to be held under Lebanon’s presidency in November.@@@We also look forward to contributing to the establishment of that nuclear-weapon-free zone.@@@Many countries in the world today face severe economic crises, the causes of which are multifaceted and well known, as they have had a major impact on all aspects of life.@@@That has made it imperative for many Governments and countries to resort to extraordinary measures in seeking to alleviate the impact of such crises on their peoples.@@@In my country, Lebanon, we have faced the worst socioeconomic crisis in our history for the past several years, which has affected all our institutions and placed the majority of Lebanese below the poverty line.@@@It has caused many people to emigrate, with our homeland losing many of its best and most promising young people.@@@That comes on top of severe and unprecedented economic deterioration, the collapse of the national currency to its lowest levels in history and the closures imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, not to mention the Beirut port explosion catastrophe, the cause of which we are seeking to determine.@@@We are also dealing with the consequences of the Syrian crisis and the burden of those who have been displaced.@@@In that context, the Lebanese Government is confronted by an unprecedented political crisis that has made it necessary to tread very slowly and carefully across a political and economic minefield in order to remedy the situation and create an environment conducive to pulling Lebanon out of its current crisis.@@@Our Government has succeeded in achieving many of its goals, most notably in the timely holding of parliamentary elections despite the difficult circumstances prevailing in the country.@@@Nevertheless, the road ahead of Lebanon continues to be long, arduous and fraught with difficulties before it can overcome the crisis.@@@We are working with all our resources and determination to successfully achieve that.@@@In that connection, our Government signed a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund.@@@From this rostrum, we pledge to advance all necessary legislative and administrative reforms in order to overcome the current crisis.@@@We continue to count on the assistance of Lebanon’s international friends, most notably the sisterly Arab States.@@@Lebanon, an Arab country by affiliation and identity and the co-founder of the League of Arab States, has great respect for the Arab States.@@@Lebanon’s Arab affiliation and its commitment to Arab causes reflect the provisions of its Constitution and the Taif Agreement, which ended the bloody civil war that ravaged my country.@@@I must reiterate our full commitment to the Taif Agreement, as well as our unwillingness to tolerate any attempt to undermine its provisions.@@@We also reaffirm our commitment to our policy of non-alignment, which we have pursued on the same path as our previous Government, in an effort to protect our country as far as possible from adopting any position that it cannot sustain.@@@The Lebanese Government also relies on the United Nations and its Member States, which through their commendable assistance to Lebanon have always emphasized that a capable and prosperous Lebanese State is urgently needed to ensure peace and security in the region and the world.@@@In the context of efforts to address the economic crisis, our Government is also working on a financial and economic recovery plan that complements our cooperation with the International Monetary Fund.@@@We are working on a package of comprehensive structural and sectoral reforms that meet the requirements of the Lebanese people and provide them with a social safety net.@@@We are also developing laws that ensure absolute transparency and combat the scourge of corruption, which has been exacerbated as a result of the economic collapse.@@@At the same time, we are working to revive the economy and to benefit from the many potential opportunities, especially with respect to the younger generations, for whom we are responsible.@@@They are a beacon of hope for the success of a Lebanese economic model that is open to the world and offers it new opportunities.@@@In that context, we appeal to sisterly and friendly countries to stand by Lebanon in its ongoing crisis and support us in overcoming it by addressing the serious repercussions of the crisis on the Lebanese people and the structure of the State.@@@We look forward to reconvening the Friends of Lebanon Conference for Investment and Finance, which has long been hosted by France in cooperation with Lebanon’s friends and brothers.@@@The existence of a sovereign and independent Lebanese State — that is strong and capable; protects the parliamentary democratic system and public and
private freedoms; believes in tolerance, fraternity and convergence; and pursues its policy of non-alignment, rejecting the policy of axes — is urgently needed in order to ensure peace, security, stability and prosperity in the region.@@@In addition, a strong central Government that ensures the rule of law and its proper application, as well as an enabling environment for businesses, productive sectors and services in all their diversity — in accordance with market standards, a free economy, current requirements, and the information and communication revolution — is urgently needed by the entire region and presents the best way for all of us to tackle the challenges of poverty, unemployment, extremism and terrorism and to avoid spiralling into the unknown.@@@For more than a decade, Lebanon has been at the forefront of achieving the global public good by hosting a massive number of displaced Syrians.@@@It is difficult to provide accurate figures of their number.@@@Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, we have adopted an open- border policy based on our commitment to humanitarian considerations.@@@However, the displacement crisis currently exceeds Lebanon’s capabilities.@@@It is also important to emphasize that the Lebanese Constitution, with the consensus of all Lebanese people, prevents any integration or settlement on its territory.@@@The only realistic sustainable solution is to achieve the safe and dignified return of Syrians to their country in the framework of a road map that we should start work on as soon as possible, with the cooperation of all parties.@@@Additional qualitative assistance should also be provided to the Lebanese State and its various institutions and infrastructure, which have been overstretched by the large influx of displaced persons for more than 10 years.@@@The Palestinian question remains the main obstacle to the achievement of peace and stability in the Middle East.@@@The injustice against the Palestinian people must end.@@@The independent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, must be realized in keeping with all the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, including resolution 194 (III), on the return of refugees to their homes.@@@Concerning the Palestinian refugees, I would like to emphasize the central role played by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in serving the goals and purposes of the United Nations by helping to alleviate some of the suffering of Palestinian refugees and achieve a measure of regional development and stability.@@@In that regard, we express our deep concern about the Agency’s critical financial situation and accumulated budget deficit, which jeopardize the delivery of its services.@@@We also reiterate that Lebanon welcomes and supports all international efforts to bridge the deficit, as the primary challenge remains finding a sustainable solution to the funding gap.@@@Lebanon has a long cultural history.@@@Lebanon has always promoted a message of peace, tolerance and dialogue.@@@Although my country is currently experiencing challenging times, those difficulties will not deter the Lebanese people from moving forward to achieving once again their prosperity and strengthen the pioneering role that Lebanon has always played internationally.@@@We want Lebanon to be a place for convergence, not division.@@@We want Lebanon to be a space for dialogue, not competition.@@@We want it to be a spiritual custodian that brings together the values of the divine religions and the values of truth and justice in the world.@@@I am confident that, with the unity of its people and the help of its brothers and friends, we can achieve what we want.@@@In conclusion, I reiterate my gratitude to the United Nations for its continued cooperation and partnership with Lebanon and to all Member States that love and support Lebanon.@@@I reiterate my call on everyone not to disassociate Lebanon from all the conflicts in the region and the world.@@@The greater the challenges, the more we are willing to work together for the good of our people.@@@The recent series of global crises have demonstrated the importance of international cooperation in addressing them, as most of them have become transboundary in nature.@@@I would like to conclude by referring to the beginning of the United Nations, when it commenced its collective work in solidarity and complementarity for the benefit and well-being of humankind, based on justice, security, peace and sustainable development.@@@We hope for a better world, especially in the Middle East region.@@@I extend my best wishes to all members.@@@I take this opportunity to read a letter from President Nicolas Maduro Moros for the peoples of the world.@@@“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela extends a greeting of brotherhood to the Presidents, Heads of Government and Prime Ministers of the 193 countries of the United Nations.@@@“Likewise, we salute Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly, and other authorities present at this seventy-seventh annual general debate, wishing them every success in the development of this important debate of ideas for timely and collective action in the face of common problems.@@@“I take the time allotted to us to speak in this forum, on behalf of 30 million Venezuelan men and women, to send an open letter to humankind, which I believe is the sole addressee and purpose that gives meaning to the words of a twenty-first century leader, above all at such a crucial moment for the world, when greater stewardship is needed from the peoples in creating alternatives to transform reality.@@@It is also because we have never been so aware of being a single community, one and multiple at the same time, as we are now as the very thing we share and that makes us equal — life itself — hangs in the balance.@@@This letter comes from the heart of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country that many have heard of and of which, paradoxically, little is known in relation to its political truth, its historical identity and its concrete reality.@@@“Certainly, a pernicious global campaign of discredit and stigmatization has been waged against our people, our republican institutions and our democratic revolution, for the simple fact that, in the waning days of the last century, we challenged the single-minded regime that was imposed on the world under the mask of the market economy and neoliberal globalization — a model that, in the name of freedom, became the modern version of colonization.@@@“The aim of this campaign against Venezuela is none other than to create the objective conditions to politically and economically suffocate any attempt to create alternatives to the imperialist and predatory system that capitalism, in all its historical phases, has turned out to be.@@@Imposing their false story, they accuse us of being a dictatorship and a failed State to hide the truth from the world.@@@During the past two decades, my country has held 29 free elections that have defined the social, economic and political model that we call Bolivarian socialism.@@@That is why we have been attacked in multiple ways.@@@“The peoples of the world should know that every kind of playbook has been applied to Venezuela to destabilize its democracy.@@@“Politically, imperialism has been unsuccessfully using the illegal method of regime change.@@@They have promoted assassination attempts and invasions, created seditious movements against the Constitution, and even invented a fictitious parallel Government that bordered on the ridiculous.@@@“Economically, few know that 913 illegal sanctions weigh on our small but dignified country, which, in a word, prevent my people from selling and buying what they produce and need for the development and enjoyment of our individual and collective existence.@@@This translates concretely into suffering, deprivation and systematic attacks that restrict life and the collective rights of my country, which is why we do not hesitate to denounce such cruel measures as crimes against humanity.@@@This economic war, whose losses for my nation have exceeded $150 billion dollars in recent years, intensified during the most serious phase of the global pandemic, making it impossible for us to buy medical supplies, medicines and vaccines.@@@“The stigmatization has also served Europe and the United States as an alibi for carrying out the most shameless plundering that has been committed against our patrimony and assets abroad.@@@More than 31 tons of Venezuelan gold reserves deposited in the Bank of England, calculated to be worth $1.3 billion, remain sequestered.@@@Another example is the theft of the Citgo Petroleum Corporation, valued at more than $30 billion in February 2019, adding to the more than $10 billion of Venezuelan deposits and funds illegally blocked in foreign banks.@@@“But these illegal sanctions have never been able to bend the will of our people, but have strengthened it in the same way that the conscience and the resolve to be free are strengthened.@@@Neither have they sidetracked us from our path to social justice.@@@Even in the worst circumstances, our model protects and prioritizes human beings in their social rights: access to housing, education, health, work and culture.@@@“This act of piracy against our country, however, has left deep wounds in society.@@@Those include induced migration, which is flaunted in the media for political and propaganda purposes precisely by those who have propagated and promoted it with false promises and a blockade of their living conditions.@@@Nothing is said about the fact that 60 per cent of the Venezuelans who migrated have voluntarily returned to their country, fleeing conditions of slavery and exploitation, as well as the mistreatment and persecution to which they have been subjected in many countries of the world.@@@Also hidden from the world is the fact that the Venezuelan State is the only one that has a repatriation policy through its airline, Conviasa, which has been permanently boycotted due to illegal sanctions.@@@“We ask the multilateral organizations: where have the millions in resources supposedly earmarked to support Venezuelan migrants gone?@@@Accountability would be useful in clearing up the opacity with which such allocations have been carried out.@@@In the same way, we demand that multilateral organizations guarantee the rights of all migrants throughout the world.@@@We do so with the moral authority of a country that, for more than 100 years, has been a beneficiary of good practices towards its migrant population.@@@In this vein, we alert the peoples of the world to the resurgence of xenophobia and aporophobia, hate speech and crimes, and intolerance in general incubated by neo-fascist and neo-Nazi movements that find shelter in political parties and ultra-conservative and far-right Governments.@@@“Humankind, which sees and listens to us today, has the right to know that, even in the most extreme conditions that I have summarized here, our people have not given up.@@@Quite the contrary, they have paved the way for the consolidation of social peace, economic recovery and the strengthening of democracy.@@@We know in our own flesh the adversity and the miracles that our own will and effort can work.@@@For this reason and from concrete experience, we have built consensus around social and political peace.@@@We have launched an economic plan to confront the blockade, creating new sources of wealth such as tourism, national industrialization, entrepreneurship and agricultural development.@@@“For the first time in 120 years, we are producing 80 per cent of what we consume and can therefore affirm that we are in a position to join efforts to face the great threats that loom over the world.@@@As one of the main world Powers in oil and gas matters, Venezuela can and wants to be useful, as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in the energy emergency that has been dragging on for a decade and profoundly affecting the price and supply system, impacting the poorest and richest countries alike.@@@“The coronavirus disease pandemic and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia have dramatically aggravated the situation.@@@However, beyond our historical ability to guarantee, as an irreplaceable producer, the energy balance demanded by the international community, we are concerned about the impact of the various world conflicts on food security.@@@Venezuela has 30 million cultivable hectares and is convinced that only a return to sustainable agriculture can help overcome world hunger and poverty.@@@We offer our potential and our firm determination to work actively in the search for global solutions.@@@“Undoubtedly, all nations are beset by various problems, each of such profound complexity and gravity that it would be difficult to rank them.@@@Perhaps, of all of them, one of the most imperative is that of world peace and security, which today is severely weakened, as has been mentioned by all those who have preceded me at this rostrum.@@@Regardless of our ideological positions, we must agree on the need to prioritize the re-establishment of the diplomatic path and political dialogue over military confrontation.@@@Humankind will not survive a world war.@@@Therefore, an escalation of war in any part of the world is in no one’s interest.@@@“For my country, a people that has never participated in an international armed conflict, there is no other way than peace, justice, trust and respect for international law.@@@We therefore endorse the proposal of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who calls for the creation of an international commission to facilitate sovereign dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, and we stand ready to facilitate its conditions.@@@We reject all the military provocations and interfering economic sanctions that have been taken against Russia, as well as the hate campaign unleashed against the Slavic people, believing that such actions, far from adding to peace, fuel the fire of war.@@@In my country’s opinion — and I am sure that public opinion is on our side — there is no such thing as good wars and bad wars.@@@“After the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, international trust was broken and the contradictions typical of an imperialist and supremacist logic became more acute.@@@Since then, we have seen blood spilled with impunity in Iraq, Yemen, Haiti, Somalia, Libya and Syria, to name just a few milestones in the shameful tragedy that is destroying indispensable international law.@@@“Notwithstanding what has been said, in Venezuela we have reasons to be optimistic.@@@That is because we have learned to trust the people — its intelligence, its benevolence and its attachment to justice and true life.@@@But it is necessary to recognize that the dominant world order faces multiple crises competing in their lethal potential, converging and articulating with one another.@@@The climate crisis aggravates the food crisis, the health crisis deepens the social crisis, the energy crisis intensifies the economic crisis, and the latter endangers world peace.@@@“Transversally to all this, the no less pernicious crisis of truth is upon us, now exacerbated by information contamination and fake news.@@@We are facing a regime of representation, misrepresentation and suppression of reality imposed by the algorithm of new communication technologies at the convenience of the most powerful.@@@The manipulation of information and emotions is only part of the problem.@@@“We are witnessing a global state of surveillance and digital control that violates citizens’ rights to privacy and truthful information, turning our democracies into infocracies, as the South Korean philosopher Byung Chul-Han states in his most recent book.@@@The death of truth is the clearest symptom of the decline of a civilization and the preamble to perpetual conflict.@@@Let us not allow the truth to succumb at the historical moment when we have the best chance of applying it, together with reason and sensitivity, as an antidote to collapse.@@@“The peoples of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania know that, due to its transcendent and definitive nature, we must face this multidimensional crisis with humanity by going to the heart of the problem.@@@Where is the telluric fault that is shaking the building of the prevailing order?@@@It lies in the crisis of the Western supremacist, imperialist model of civilization, which denies, attacks and tries to suppress the other and the differences among us, and that does not recognize other models or other political, economic, religious or cultural paradigms foreign to its own.@@@“Despite Western arrogance, we are experiencing a post-imperial change of era, and the global North must recognize that the reigning unipolar and colonialist order is not capable of responding satisfactorily to the problems and needs that it has created to the detriment of humankind, animal life and the planet.@@@The latter is, from our ordinary worldview, the living being most exploited, violated and destroyed by capitalism in all its historical phases.@@@“We are not just engaging in ideological reflection, nothing more.@@@The climate crisis, which is already irreversible, could be the confirmation that a change of model is imminent.@@@“The North must accept the indisputable emergence of new Powers and new leadership, such as China, Russia, India, Iran and Tiirkiye.@@@It has to be open to the possibility of being part of a multipolar, pluricentric world that is free of hegemony.@@@It is urgent that there be an ethical change among the old Powers to build a common new world without colonizers or colonized, in which we work together towards the solutions that our peoples demand of us.@@@There is no time for arrogance or useless confrontations or skirmishes.@@@“In very unique circumstances 207 years ago, the freedom fighter Simon Bolivar, in his prophetic Jamaica Letter, invoked the wisdom of the West.@@@“‘And shall Europe, the civilized, the merchant, the lover of liberty allow an aged serpent, bent only on satisfying its venomous rage, devour the fairest part of our globe?@@@...@@@Is Europe deaf to the clamour of her own interests?’@@@(Selected Writings of Bolivar, Volume 1 ,p. 107)
“In that regard, I wonder whether European and North American leadership is deaf.@@@We ask ourselves that today, as we are on the brink of a crisis that could be the last crisis for humankind.@@@“Venezuela hopes that the Assembly will listen to reason, wisdom and prudence, recognize and respect the rights of the peoples of the world and address the injustice committed against the Saharawi and the Palestinian people by denying them the right to a homeland.@@@We hope for an end to the illegal economic sanctions and political persecution against Nicaragua and against our brotherly Cuba, Iran and Russia.@@@We hope that the Argentine people will be compensated and that their rights over the Malvinas Islands, taken with blood and fire by the imperial logic that we have denounced, will be restored.@@@“Only through dialogue, only through words and reason shared among equals, can we build the bridges we need to heal the wounds and leave behind the abyss that instils fear in humankind.@@@“It is with that belief, and not to comply with the protocol of the general debate, that I send this message.@@@My focus is on the streets, where the ordinary men and women of Abyei, New York, Istanbul, London, Damascus, Ramallah, Tehran, Cape Town, Moscow, Beijing, Managua, Havana, Caracas and many more places are not looking for answers but rather for a call to be part of the building of a new humanity.@@@Because I believe in the power of words and in those men and women who refuse to give up hope, I am sure that this call will not fall on deaf ears.@@@“Let us have the good sense to recognize that the hegemonic global model is coming to an end, and let us arm ourselves with the necessary enthusiasm to build a new multicentric, multipolar, intercultural and balanced world.@@@“Let us change what needs to be changed and let us have the courage to be reborn in the face of new times and new challenges.@@@Another world, another life, is not only possible — it is today more urgent than ever.”@@@That statement was written by Nicolas Maduro Moros in Caracas on 24 September.@@@We have gathered this year as a brutal war with a multifaceted and global impact continues to rage in Europe.@@@The Russian aggression against Ukraine has upended the rules-based order, the multilateral system and economic flows.@@@It has brought about human suffering and refugee flows, destruction of civilian infrastructure and war crimes.@@@The latest announcements about partial mobilization in Russia, preparations for the organization of sham referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine and nuclear threats are another dangerous escalation in an already unprecedented crisis.@@@While the Ukrainian people are suffering the most in their struggle to defend their homes, the consequences of the Russian aggression are felt globally and so it must be condemned worldwide.@@@Three decades ago, Croatia itself was a war-ravaged country in jeopardy, also facing armed aggression.@@@Almost a third of its territory was occupied.@@@Additionally, we had to fight for international recognition and were under an arms embargo.@@@The Croatian people know what it means to be under attack and what it takes to defend their homeland.@@@Against all odds, Croatia and the Croatian people prevailed.@@@Many, especially our defenders, paid the highest price for our freedom and liberty.@@@Stronger for its own experience, Croatia today is an exporter of peace and stability, a humanitarian donor worldwide, a popular tourist destination and the country that produces the fastest electric car in the world.@@@Success is possible if one is determined and has a vision of the future.@@@Precisely because of our own experience, Croatia immediately and unequivocally extended political, humanitarian, economic and military support and solidarity to Ukraine.@@@To do otherwise would be a betrayal of principles and values we all hold dear, particularly respect for human rights and responsibility to protect populations from atrocity crimes.@@@This time around, Europe and its partners came together to stand up to aggression, show solidarity and strengthen their own resilience.@@@In October, we will highlight this unity once more in Zagreb, as Croatia prepares to host the first-ever Parliamentary Summit of the Crimea Platform.@@@Croatia’s transition was long and complex, but it was guided by a firm notion that democracy, human rights and respect for national minorities was the best way for Croatian society as a whole to further develop and prosper.@@@Today our democratic systems are challenged by the fallacious and dangerous thesis that autocracy is ultimately a more efficient and pragmatic way to govern.@@@Our national dialogues are distorted by targeted disinformation, fake news and hybrid attacks.@@@Our trust in democracy is being undermined from both within and outside of our societies.@@@As fierce as these challenges are, our commitment to democracy, its procedures and values must remain strong.@@@On the crossroads between democracy and autocracy, our choice should remain clear.@@@In today’s perilous moment, Croatia remains a staunch supporter of the international rules-based order and the United Nations at the centre of global cooperation.@@@Although far from being ideal, this system, with all of its flaws, has still enabled the world to reach common ground and find some remarkable and inspirational results for local and global issues in the almost eight decades of its existence.@@@We live in a plurality of simultaneous and interconnected crises that affect us all.@@@In order to overcome this perfect storm of crises, we need determined action now.@@@The further erosion of our core rules and values should be halted and reversed, respect for international law upheld and accountability ensured.@@@We should also act to make our system fit for purpose.@@@That is particularly true for the reform of the Security Council.@@@The General Assembly intervened instead and offered a platform for an overwhelming majority of States to condemn the aggression against a sovereign and independent country.@@@When the world is facing a geopolitical crisis of the scale such as the one in Ukraine today, we must ensure that our policies and actions are predictable, reliable and timely across the United Nations system.@@@Croatia’s adherence to promoting peace and security is evident also in its continuous participation in the United Nations, European Union (EU) and NATO peacekeeping missions and operations.@@@It is an investment we are readily willing to make.@@@As we were beginning to recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the war in Ukraine dramatically altered our perspectives and political agenda.@@@It radically changed not only the security
but also the energy architecture of Europe, and is threatening global food security.@@@We must stand united and step up our efforts to reorganize the energy supply lines.@@@We cannot accept extortion and we cannot be held hostage over food and energy, which all of us need.@@@Therefore, we applaud the Secretary-General and the United Nations for their role in brokering the deal to export Ukrainian grain.@@@On the regional level, Croatia is contributing to energy security and diversification by its liquefied natural gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk.@@@Beyond ensuring its own needs, Croatia is now able to supply its neighbours and other countries in Central Europe.@@@Simultaneously, we are investing in renewable energy, with a third of our energy consumption and almost half of our electricity production already coming from renewables.@@@We are ensuring a fair transition and preventing energy poverty, implementing financial measures that benefit both the citizens and the business sector.@@@We must find a global solution to the price of gas, which threatens our households and our economies.@@@It is intolerable for a minority of speculators to enrich themselves in these times by imposing exorbitant prices.@@@What is more, we are also witnessing an intolerable imbalance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.@@@The richest 1 per cent in the world are responsible for 15 per cent of emissions — twice as much as half the poorest of humankind.@@@That is not acceptable.@@@It is up to those who pollute the most to provide the most effort; that is not only fair but also the most effective if we are to achieve our climate objectives.@@@Clean mobility and innovative technologies are an opportunity and new technologies, such as hydrogen, offer new horizons for stronger cooperation between Europe, Africa and the Middle East.@@@While we in Croatia successfully passed the test during the pandemic and avoided social fracture with tailored national measures, global inflation and the rise of prices have to be tackled again.@@@We as a Government are continuing our interventionist policy to alleviate the burden of the energy crisis on our households and businesses, local Governments and public institutions, schools and hospitals.@@@Similar to our efforts during the pandemic, we are now implementing a strong national package worth more than 6 per cent of our gross domestic product.@@@That includes financial measures, subsidies for vulnerable groups and limitations on the prices of basic food items.@@@I wish to say a few words on climate change and biodiversity.@@@Despite the enormous current challenges, we have a responsibility to also safeguard our commitments to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Croatia welcomes the ambitious approach put forward in the report of the Secretary-General Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a concrete road map towards its realization.@@@Here, too, a revitalized global action and political commitment are needed to ensure effective multilateralism.@@@By integrating the Sustainable Development Goals in its national development strategy towards 2030, Croatia has proven its dedication to their full implementation.@@@As a current member of the Economic and Social Council, we will work closely together with our partners to ensure more sustainable, greener, inclusive and equitable societies in which no one will be left behind.@@@Ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, let us evaluate the implementation of our joint commitments from Glasgow.@@@We need to strengthen cooperation in the effort to find mechanisms and financial resources to fulfil the Paris Agreement and to continue the fight against climate change at the national, regional and global levels.@@@In the year in which we are marking the thirtieth anniversary of our United Nations membership, Croatia remains a constructive and responsible international actor.@@@In the coming months, we will join a group of only 15 other countries that are at the same time members of the EU, NATO, the Eurozone and the Schengen Area.@@@That follows a sober and prudent decision in line with my Government’s policy of modern sovereignism.@@@Through that policy, we have strengthened our international position by pooling resources with our allies and partners, furthering our national interests and tackling economic and social challenges.@@@Croatia also pays special attention to South-East Europe, a region still not fully integrated into the EU.@@@The region’s stability, development and democratic progress are not only in our, but also in Europe’s interest.@@@We support a clear European Union perspective for candidates and aspirants based on the fulfilment of well-established and clear criteria, the implementation of reforms and the delivery of tangible results.@@@The stability of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which we share a 1,000-kilometre border, is of particular importance to Croatia.@@@We would like to see
a prosperous and functional Bosnia and Herzegovina progressing firmly on the path to EU membership.@@@In the light of the current situation in Ukraine and elsewhere, it is pivotal that international law and international treaties be respected.@@@That includes in particular peace treaties such as the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement, which brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina as the multinational and multicultural homeland of its three constitutive peoples — Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs — as well as others.@@@For the cohesion, stability and progress of the country, their constitutional full equality must be ensured and respected.@@@Given the fact that the Bosniak political leaders have publicly admitted they had no true intention of coming to a deal with Bosnian Croat political leaders over the electoral reform, in line with the Constitutional Court verdict, the only way forward remains for High Representative Christian Schmidt to act and use his Bonn powers.@@@As a friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I call upon him to use his powers to ensure legitimate representation and equality of Bosnian Croats in the country’s institutions following the 2 October general election.@@@As the least numerous among the constituent peoples, the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina demand no favours, only equality.@@@We are mutually interdependent.@@@Turmoil in one region has consequences for us, all no matter where we are on the globe.@@@None of our national goals can be achieved without solidarity and the rules-based order upon which not only our security, but also our survival rests.@@@We must build, protect and defend, and stand up to those who destroy, lie and loot.@@@As we witness aggression and atrocities on European soil again and as the rule of power threatens to bring the world order down, we owe it to future generations to be on the right side of history.@@@The international community must foster its unity and stand with Ukraine in the fight for its own existence.@@@We have to unite in our respect for international law, as well as in finding global solutions to overlapping crises, including rising inflation, energy and food crises.@@@To achieve secure and affordable energy, we need a global solution for gas prices.@@@We must also ensure sustainable energy transition.@@@Our world has changed permanently.@@@In these new circumstances, more international cooperation has no alternative.@@@Let us commit to working jointly for the benefit of our common future.@@@The approach of democracies in international relations is a cooperative one.@@@The approach of the authoritarian regimes is a conflictual one.@@@The global Organization, the United Nations — and all of us within it — must prove that the rules-based order and the cooperative approach will prevail.@@@First of all, I congratulate Mr. Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@We meet here at United Nations Headquarters at a critical time for humankind.@@@The world of today appears to have entered a new, increasingly bitter period of geopolitical confrontation.@@@The long-standing international system, based on order and responsibility, is giving way to a new, more chaotic and unpredictable one.@@@The global system of checks and balances has failed to maintain peace and stability.@@@The security architecture is eroding.@@@Mutual distrust among global Powers is dangerously deepening.@@@The world is falling prey to a new set of military conflicts.@@@For the first time in two generations, we face the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, and not even as a last resort.@@@New fault lines are creating artificial barriers and economic isolation.@@@Economic and political sanctions have become a new norm that erodes the supply chains that ensure food security, threatening millions, especially in vulnerable communities.@@@These problems contribute to the mounting challenges of soaring inflation, job loss and fears of a worldwide recession, especially for developing nations.@@@Finally, these crises severely hamper the urgent action we all agreed to take to combat climate change and enhance sustainable development.@@@Some 77 years ago, the founding Members placed within the Charter of the United Nations the principles and norms of international law that have successfully guided us ever since.@@@There is nothing more important now than to return to the foundational principles that lie at the root of this universal Organization.@@@In particular, we must rethink the linkages between three primordial principles: the sovereign equality of States, the territorial integrity of States and peaceful coexistence among States.@@@These three principles are interdependent.@@@To respect one is to respect the other two.@@@To undermine one is to undermine the other two.@@@When the global disarmament regime — both conventional and nuclear — is weakened, those three principles are threatened.@@@Conversely, as those three principles are respected, they grow in strength.@@@Together, they become the basis for greater inter-State cooperation at every level: subregional, regional and global.@@@This is the global prosperity dividend.@@@That system of values, embodied in the United Nations, remains a beacon of hope for millions of people in different parts of our planet.@@@We must staunchly defend these values, the United Nations as its core and the spirit of cooperation that underpins it.@@@In other words, we cannot simply shrug our shoulders and agree to polarization and division.@@@We cannot afford indecision or narrow interests, which are detrimental to that common heritage and our collective good.@@@Too much is at stake.@@@Therefore, Kazakhstan stands ready to cooperate with all relevant actors in a spirit of inclusiveness, multilateralism and goodwill.@@@I am convinced that the challenges of our time can be overcome only by countries acting together.@@@To achieve our shared goals, we must go forward in the following directions.@@@The multiple and often interconnected crises of recent years have exposed significant gaps in global governance.@@@They have highlighted the need to modernize and reform the United Nations.@@@The United Nations must be better prepared for future challenges and opportunities.@@@In that respect, Kazakhstan welcomed the proposals in the report of the Secretary- General on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@This is an important opportunity to reaffirm the Charter of the United Nations, reinvigorate multilateralism, boost implementation of existing commitments, agree on concrete solutions to new challenges, and restore trust among Member States.@@@We look forward to contributing to the consultations at the ministerial meeting next year and to the holding of the 2024 Summit of the Future.@@@We must move from simply responding to global challenges and crises to preventing and better predicting emerging trends and integrating our assessments into strategic planning and policymaking.@@@For that very purpose, Kazakhstan proposed 30 years ago the idea of convening the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia.@@@In the context of new challenges and threats, we hope to transform the Conference into a full-fledged international organization at the upcoming summit in October, in Astana, to contribute to global mediation and peacemaking.@@@With only eight years until 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals are hampered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a triple planetary crisis — climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution— and conflicts around the world.@@@We need to get back on track before it is too late.@@@Our top priority must be to build resilience against future turmoil and to ensure a sustainable, equitable and inclusive recovery.@@@To that end, we need a frank dialogue between East and West and a new global security paradigm based on the principles of mutual trust and multifaceted cooperation.@@@Given the current crisis and increased geopolitical tensions, there is an acute need for a process under the auspices of the United Nations that can lead to detente and conflict prevention.@@@Kazakhstan has suffered terribly from past nuclear weapons testing, so we understand very clearly the dangers of escalating tensions among nuclear Powers.@@@For that reason, nuclear disarmament has become a key part of Kazakh foreign policy and we will be continuously struggling for a world free of nuclear arsenals.@@@Despite some progress in this area, unfortunately, the whole record is not that positive.@@@We are alarmed by the increased rivalry and rhetoric of nuclear States.@@@We are also concerned at the lack of progress made by the Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Elaborating new mechanisms to ensure disarmament and non-proliferation is a daunting task ahead.@@@Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to manage and reduce biological risks and dangers.@@@It should be of universal concern that we still rely on the Biological Weapons Convention — now 50 years old — without any effort to create an agency or body for international cooperation.@@@In that context, I would like to reiterate my earlier proposal to establish an international agency for biological safety.@@@Along with threats to international security, climate change requires greater international cooperation and solidarity as well.@@@Around the world, people are facing existential threats from weather and environmental change.@@@If we are to turn this tide, we need more action, and we need it fast.@@@Many of us have taken bold steps already.@@@In Kazakhstan, we have pledged the total transformation of the oil- and coal-dependent energy sector into a net zero economy by 2060.@@@To save our planet, we need investment at greater levels than we have ever seen.@@@However, climate action cannot come at the expense of development or modernization.@@@Therefore, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year, Member States, as well as the global business community, must once again scale up their commitment to greater climate finance.@@@That agenda relates directly to the global food security crisis.@@@My country, the world’s seventh- largest grain producer, is the breadbasket of Central Asia.@@@We are committed to utilizing this agricultural potential to fight global food insecurity.@@@Kazakhstan
will continue to act as a reliable supplier of grain and other food staples, first of all to the poorest countries.@@@It also intends to grow its cooperation with the Islamic Organization for Food Security, located in Kazakhstan, as well as with United Nations agencies.@@@It is imperative in that connection to exclude food and fertilizers from any sanctions and restrictions whatsoever.@@@Once again, current economic and social upheavals require a collective effort.@@@Commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an integral part of our national and global agenda.@@@In addition, fair trade regimes are crucial to global economic recovery.@@@In that context, I would like to commend the constructive decisions coming out of the twelfth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, chaired by Kazakhstan.@@@The current geopolitical situation also highlights the importance of a reliable and diversified global transit and transport infrastructure.@@@We are seeing this in our own region.@@@Kazakhstan, the largest landlocked developing country, is becoming a vital Asian land corridor to Europe.@@@The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, or Middle Corridor, has received new impetus.@@@We expect cargo volume through Kazakhstan to increase significantly in the years ahead.@@@We must ensure that the Caspian Sea becomes a sea of peace and new opportunities.@@@In the months ahead, Kazakhstan will help mitigate the most immediate impacts of limited access to energy and critical raw materials caused by trade and supply chain disruptions.@@@In the long term, we aim to diversify our sources of energy, with a particular focus on green hydrogen and renewables.@@@Speaking about Central Asia, we should bear in mind that it has already become a region of vast opportunities for international cooperation.@@@Together with our Central Asian partners, we are committed to strengthening political interaction and deepening economic ties to move our region forward.@@@We have agreed to coexist as good neighbours and diversify our cooperation.@@@This credo is based on our significant natural and agricultural resources, human capital, and transport and transit potential.@@@We are a buffer market between East and West, South and North.@@@We intend to work together with all stakeholders to address a pressing regional agenda that includes climate change, the Aral Sea, the rational use of water resources, border delimitation, combating extremism and expanding intraregional trade.@@@That is why we consider it important to establish a United Nations regional centre for the Sustainable Development Goals for Central Asia and Afghanistan in Almaty.@@@Kazakhstan sees the future Afghanistan as a truly independent, neutral, united, prosperous State, living in peace with its neighbours.@@@Therefore, we support the difficult process of nation-building in that country, including life-saving humanitarian assistance.@@@As President of Kazakhstan, I am absolutely committed to building a just Kazakhstan, one in which every citizen has the same opportunities, rights and protections.@@@Justice in my country must prevail.@@@Law and order will become pillars of our society.@@@The most important part of this path is transformative political reform.@@@Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Kazakhstan over the coming months.@@@According to my proposal, the presidential mandate has been limited to one seven-year term.@@@This is a real breakthrough in developing democracy in Kazakhstan.@@@At the same time, we will be firmly adhering to my formula of “Strong President, Authoritative Parliament, Accountable Government”.@@@I am convinced this formula excellently serves the national interests of Kazakhstan.@@@We also aim to de-monopolize the economy.@@@We are taking steps to ensure that the wealthiest in our society play their part in our quest for a just Kazakhstan, along with diversifying our economy and increasing investments in human capital.@@@Recently, I initiated the creation of a National Fund for Children.@@@Starting in 2024, 50 per cent of the investment income from the National Welfare Fund will be allocated to special savings accounts for children until their adulthood.@@@These funds could be used for education or housing purposes.@@@A special private charity fund, known as “For the people of Kazakhstan”, also now provides assistance to ordinary citizens for health care, education and social security aims.@@@We aim to further expand the empowerment and participation of women in economic and public life.@@@Comprehensive national transformation is not a simple process, and there will certainly be pitfalls and bumps in the road.@@@But if we are firmly to meet the expectations of Kazakh citizens, we cannot deviate from this strategic path.@@@Over the past three years, we have carried out substantial transformations through four packages of political reforms.@@@For example, new laws passed by Parliament have simplified political parties’
registration and reduced the threshold for parties to enter Parliament from 7 per cent to 5 per cent.@@@To promote the wider involvement of citizens in governance, there is now a mandatory 30 per cent quota for women and young people in electoral party lists.@@@To make local administration more accountable, local mayors are now elected directly.@@@To foster a more open culture between society and Government, we have changed the law on peaceful assembly; Government authorization is no longer required.@@@Following its international commitments on the fundamental right to life and human dignity, Kazakhstan abolished the death penalty.@@@A just Kazakhstan depends on our multi-ethnic and multi-confessional solidarity.@@@The “unity in diversity” principle will be preserved at all costs.@@@Last week, the seventh Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions was successfully held in Kazakhstan.@@@The Congress once again highlighted the importance of religious tolerance, dialogue and mediation.@@@We are ready to build bridges and provide platforms for dialogue wherever needed.@@@This year marks 30 years of Kazakhstan-United Nations partnership.@@@The Organization has contributed strongly to the formation and strengthening of an independent Kazakhstan.@@@Over that period, we have worked for the aims of the Charter in all major United Nations organs, from the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Council to the Security Council.@@@Kazakhstan will remain at the forefront of advancing a more modern, efficient, transparent and accountable Organization.@@@Never in history have we had such a need for responsible leadership for the next generations.@@@Remembering our past makes us responsible for our future.@@@Together with other Member States, we will spare no effort towards building a safer, more sustainable and prosperous global community.@@@At the outset, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its
seventy-seventh session and his entire team.@@@I pledge Thailand’s full support as he undertakes to fulfil his important mission.@@@We are at a watershed moment as an international community and as the United Nations.@@@We stand at a point where the decisions we make and the actions we pursue can shape the world and the course of humankind for years to come.@@@But we can only do it together, guided by our shared interests and on the basis of mutual respect.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has only exacerbated inequality gaps and has reversed at least four years of development gains, according to the United Nations Development Programme.@@@At a time when the world is trying to recover from the two years of the pandemic, our problems are compounded by multiple challenges.@@@We are seeing new conflicts, on top of global geopolitical tensions.@@@We are experiencing a food crisis, an energy crisis and a financing crisis.@@@These have had the most detrimental impact on those who are most vulnerable — least developed countries, small island developing States and vulnerable groups, such as women, girls, the elderly and people with disabilities.@@@Collective action is certainly needed now.@@@The food crisis has affected us all.@@@This global food insecurity is due to conflicts, climate change, disruptions to supply chains and uneven recovery from COVID-19.@@@As such, there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral action among like-minded partners, United Nations agencies, the World Trade Organization and international institutions in order to facilitate a constructive dialogue and improve policy coordination to address this crisis.@@@It is now especially vital to keep our global supply chains open for seamless cross-border flows of food, fertilizers and essential goods, while also making our food systems more resilient so that equitable access to safe and healthy food for all can be guaranteed.@@@Thailand is prepared to work in partnership with countries and international organizations in order to realize that vision.@@@In that context, Thailand welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative, established by the United Nations, to open a safe corridor for grain transportation that would help ease a global food crisis.@@@The Initiative further stresses the importance of international cooperation under the Organization’s framework in order to respond to new global challenges.@@@In addition to overcoming food insecurity, we also need to overcome health insecurity.@@@As we learned from the pandemic, good health for all is critical.@@@And that is why universal health coverage should be a high priority for us all.@@@We need to ensure access to high-quality essential health-care services and to safe, effective, high-quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for everyone.@@@We must continue to promote and protect the right to receive the highest attainable standard of health as part of our commitment to human rights.@@@We must continue to invest in promoting a more inclusive social protection system for all, as called for by the Secretary-General in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@To reinforce that, the global health architecture needs to be reformed, both structurally and functionally, in order to address the current shortcomings and systemic failures of health systems.@@@And that is why Thailand fully supports the development of a legally binding international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response under the World Health Organization (WHO).@@@The new instrument must place equity at the centre in order to ensure the self-reliance of developing countries when faced with pandemics, especially through enhancing their capacity to manufacture certain medical countermeasures.@@@With better food and health security, we will be better positioned to putting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track.@@@In doing so, a human-rights-based approach is needed in order to ensure that the rights and basic needs of all persons are guaranteed, especially those of the most vulnerable and furthest behind.@@@That will help enhance our resilience and capacity to cope with future crises.@@@SDGs serve as both the pathway and the end goal in ensuring the survival of our present and future generations.@@@As we have only eight years left to attain the SDGs, we need to employ every tool at our disposal — from science, technology and innovation to working in partnership at every level in order to drive this agenda forward — because without sustainable development, there is no future.@@@We need to promote North-South and South-South cooperation and the integration of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable peace with other cooperation frameworks, both at the global and regional levels.@@@That is why the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are working to enhance the complementarity between the 2030 Agenda for sustainable peace and the ASEAN Vision 2025.@@@Thailand’s hosting of the Global South-@@@South Development Expo with ESCAP and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation in Bangkok last week also demonstrates the importance we place on development cooperation, especially among developing countries.@@@Furthermore, financing for development and finding innovative sources of finance are key to transforming SDGs from mere aspirations to a reality for all.@@@Thailand agrees with the Secretary-General’s proposal to promote cooperation with leading global financial institutions in order to mobilize financing so as to drive forward the SDGs while improving financial liquidity for the least developed countries.@@@To promote sustainable development, Thailand has adopted the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Model as a means to achieve a more balanced development in this recovery phase.@@@The BCG Economy Model utilizes science, technology and innovation to encourage the optimization of resources for environmentally friendly economic growth.@@@In pursuing sustainable development, we need to ensure balance between our people-centred approaches and protecting our planet.@@@To that end, Thailand is ready to work with the international community in order to contain the triple planetary crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.@@@Thailand is committed to promoting international cooperation for the protection of the environment, including on the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution.@@@In tackling climate change, Thailand stands firm in our pledge at last year’s twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2065.@@@And with adequate support, Thailand will be able to increase its nationally determined contributions or targets to 40 per cent while achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.@@@That is not an empty promise.@@@Thailand will submit our nationally determined contributions and long-term low greenhouse-gas emission development strategies that reflect those goals ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@Meanwhile, the pledges of developed countries must also be fulfilled.@@@I urge developed countries to keep their promise of providing financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries and to deliver on the climate-financing goal of $100 billion annually as soon as possible.@@@Equal attention should be paid to mitigation and adaptation.@@@Thailand stands ready to work with Egypt and all partners at COP27 in that regard.@@@We need to restore faith and confidence in the multilateral system and our United Nations.@@@An important step to achieving that is to reverse the polarization in this organ by working more closely on issues that bring us together.@@@Addressing humanitarian concerns is one such issue.@@@Thailand will continue to work closely with the international community, taking into account the needs of the affected country, in order to address urgent humanitarian challenges through bilateral, regional and multilateral efforts, in accordance with the key humanitarian principles and without politicization.@@@We have supported humanitarian work in Afghanistan through the World Food Programme (WFP) and have contributed to Ukraine through the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and UNICEF.@@@As for Myanmar, Thailand has worked with partners to provide humanitarian assistance to the people in need through various programmes at the bilateral level, including the donation of 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and through ASEAN.@@@Financial contributions were also made to support the work of international organizations, such as UNICEF, WHO, WFP and the International Committee of the Red Cross.@@@As an immediate neighbour, with the longest land border, of 2,470 kilometres, it is in Thailand’s vital interests to see a quick return to peace and stability in Myanmar.@@@We call on all parties in Myanmar to urgently take steps to de-escalate, end the violence and engage in meaningful talks to resolve differences peacefully.@@@Thailand fully supports the constructive role of ASEAN and believes that ASEAN is best placed to help Myanmar through the time-tested ASEAN practice of consultation, cooperation and consensus.@@@Thailand will continue to play an active and constructive role to
support that ASEAN process, as well as the role of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar.@@@As a strong believer in multilateralism, Thailand stands ready to continue to do its part to promote multilateral and international cooperation at all levels.@@@Sustainable development and human rights are intertwined and mutually reinforcing.@@@They are vital in ensuring an environment of peace and prosperity.@@@Thailand hereby presents its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights Council for the term from 2025 to 2027.@@@If elected, we can help to strengthen the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms so as to reach out to the vulnerable and those furthest behind and bring about meaningful and real positive changes on the ground.@@@Thailand also firmly believes that close regional cooperation can complement the multilateral system and reinforce the global agenda.@@@This year, Thailand plays host to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which is meeting under the theme “Open.@@@Connect.@@@Balance”.@@@Such a theme signifies the willingness to embrace every opportunity, connect in all dimensions and balance in all aspects.@@@That highlights Thailand’s commitment to promoting multilateral cooperation, which will hopefully lead to more balanced and sustainable development after the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@We look forward to welcoming world leaders to Bangkok in November, as Thailand is fully open and ready to welcome visitors once again.@@@Despite the challenges and difficulties at this critical juncture in the history of humankind, Thailand continues to have faith in the multilateral system, with the United Nations at its core.@@@We remain confident that the goodwill and shared common interests of humankind will help us to make the right decisions at this watershed moment so that we can move together towards a more stable, sustainable and safer future, with no person or country left behind.@@@Let me now add this very brief account to end my statement.@@@A few days ago, a sentiment was expressed by the European Union foreign policy chief when he said that we should not rule out the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine crisis.@@@An oriental saying that could be related to that context pertains to the enjoyment of riding a beast, whether it be a tiger or a dragon.@@@Let us say a tiger in that context.@@@Riding on the tiger’s back could be fun and challenging, but no one could enjoy riding on its back with no end in sight.@@@The question is how to safely dismount without killing the tiger.@@@Suddenly, the question of “how to” is daunting.@@@We have a suggestion that takes all elements into account and is definitely not free of realpolitik.@@@A possible breakthrough could be apparent during the month of November, with the third week of the penultimate month of the year as our first and golden opportunity for all super-stakeholders in the Ukraine crisis to assemble at three venues in South-East Asia as legitimate participants.@@@The three venues are one in Phnom Penh for the ASEAN Summit, another in Bali for the Group of 20 and the third in Bangkok for the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting.@@@Separately or in a series, they could serve as a most appropriate platform for talks to provide a possible off-ramp or exit to the high-tension global crisis in Ukraine.@@@The world body, the United Nations, with all its relevant roles and mechanisms to help safeguard peace and stability, could certainly join in at any juncture to add value to that endeavour.@@@Let us therefore hope that that golden opportunity is not passed up by all the super-Powers and super-stakeholders with regard to the high-tension Ukraine crisis.@@@At the outset of my remarks, I wish to convey the warm congratulations of His Excellency Colonel Mamadi Doumbouya, Chair of the National Committee of Reconciliation and Development, President of the Transition, Head of State and Supreme Leader of the Armies of the Republic of Guinea, upon Mr. Csaba Korosi’s successful election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the outstanding work accomplished during his mandate.@@@I wish to express the appreciation and the deep gratitude of the Guinean authorities to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the dynamic exercise of his mandate.@@@The Guinean delegation’s participation in this meeting allows us to provide information on the situation in our country and our assessment of the international situation.@@@The Republic of Guinea, after having set the tone for independence in Africa, particularly in francophone countries, has nevertheless experienced dark times in its governance, and unfortunately the regime that ruled during the previous decade was no exception to the rule.@@@That period was marked in particular by an extreme politicization of State bodies, violations of the rule of law and financial mismanagement.@@@Ultimately, the constitutional change abolishing the two-term limit for the presidency, orchestrated by the previous President, triggered sociopolitical unrest in a nation in which development had already been paralysed, despite the country being on the path to becoming the top producer of bauxite in the world.@@@Faced with that catastrophic situation and the need to prevent abuses of power, the country’s defence and security forces, united within the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development, made a decision.@@@On 5 September 2021, in an expression of solidarity and patriotism, they decided to assume their responsibility to establish a Government of integrity that would benefit the Guinean population, particularly its women and youth, with the aim of achieving inclusive and sustainable development.@@@The population supported those ideals and communicated their expectations during consultations between the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development (CNRD) and the country’s stakeholders.@@@A stock-taking exercise was conducted to reach agreement on appropriate solutions to the challenges identified and to revive the country.@@@The goal was an institutional correction to build strong and legitimate institutions that could stand the test of time and human frailty; the re-establishment of the foundations of the State to infuse a sense of ethics into public life and restore the State’s authority; a correction aimed at breaking with old practices to reform, modernize and renew the Administration; a gathering of the people as a whole to conduct public affairs in complete transparency; and respect for all commitments at the national and international levels.@@@In that respect, the following progress was made.@@@The transition charter was drafted and published.@@@A civilian transitional Government was established.@@@The National Transition Council was established.@@@The Court to Repress Economic and Financial Crimes was established to combat corruption and the diversion of public goods and to restore trust between the population and those in power.@@@Looted State property was recovered.@@@All proceedings are based on the full independence of the justice system.@@@That is why the transitional President stressed, when he took power, that justice would be the compass of the life of our nation.@@@National symposiums, called days of truth and forgiveness, were held, and a report on the subject was submitted on 24 August.@@@On that occasion, the Head of State entrusted me with the task of disseminating the report and following up on the recommendations that emerged from those days.@@@An inclusive consultation framework was established with the support of technical and financial partners.@@@That is a platform that makes it possible for all the country’s stakeholders to exchange views on the conduct of the transition.@@@To carry out the transition in an inclusive and peaceful manner, the above-mentioned institutions have, in the exercise of their respective mandates, deployed missions within and outside the country to gather the opinions of Guinean citizens on the management of the transition and the country’s future.@@@A proposed timeline was therefore agreed by consensus in order to prevent the people of Guinea from falling back into cyclical transitions.@@@With regard to the length of the transition, I wish to highlight the fact that a key issue of the negotiations between the Republic of Guinea and the Economic Community of West African States was the content of the transition, which covers 10 points, including a general census of the population and housing and an administrative census for civil registry purposes.@@@Those two exercises will take 24 months to complete, and 12 additional months will be necessary for the holding of the three scheduled elections.@@@I cannot stress enough the imperative to conduct a quality census to establish an indisputable electoral registry that will guarantee transparent electoral processes and results that are universally accepted.@@@It should be recalled that the issue of the electoral registry has always been a point of contention and has led to various elections being contested in recent years.@@@In view of the outcome of the inclusive consultation framework and in line with his policy of outreach, the President of the transition created the framework for inclusive inter-Guinean dialogue, which has been placed under my authority.@@@We hope that reluctant stakeholders will feel a burst of patriotic pride and join the dialogue.@@@There is no obstacle today to inclusive dialogue in Guinea.@@@It is important to note that, without any pressure being exerted, the members of the CNRD, the Government and the National Transition Council decided of their own free will that they would not run for office during the upcoming elections.@@@That decision is constantly reaffirmed.@@@In terms of justice and human rights, the Guinean Government, in its respect for human rights, in addition to the judicial reforms under way, has made the organization of the trial for the events of 28 September 2009, during which there were victims, a national priority.@@@In that regard, the transitional President decided to organize, after 13 years of waiting, day after day, the opening of the trial in cooperation with the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council.@@@On the economic front, strong measures have been taken to stabilize the macroeconomic framework to strengthen the country’s resilience.@@@The development of an interim reference programme for the period from 2022 to 2025 will undoubtedly contribute to improving the living conditions of our people.@@@We would like to reassure all public and private investors of our Government’s determination to guarantee conditions conducive to a better business environment.@@@An overhaul of public finances and reforms in the mining sector, in particular the setting of the index price of bauxite, will make it possible for the population to benefit from the dividends of the growth in that sector.@@@We are committed to ensuring a careful consideration of the problems faced by the people of Guinea in order to find solutions that are sustainable for them — hence the imperative to establish the rule of law and strong institutions for a successful transition, which would be a clear guarantee of Guinea’s stability and, by extension, that of the West African subregion.@@@We will also continue to cooperate with all our partners and respect our commitments in a spirit of openness and mutual trust and respect.@@@The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is facing a number of social, political and economic challenges at the dawn of a new multipolar world order.@@@The theme chosen for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, calls on all countries of the world to show more unity in action and more solidarity in order to resolve the complex challenges generated by the coronavirus disease crisis and the crises affecting regions providing basic food stuffs, agricultural inputs and petroleum products.@@@In that regard, my country appreciates the Secretary- General’s initiatives on international peace and security and the path to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@It also reiterates the need to redouble our efforts to achieve this goal, through preventive diplomacy, respect for human rights and international solidarity in the fight against climate change and debt forgiveness for the least developed countries.@@@My country shares the concerns of the international community on the issues of peace, security, development and human rights being examined by the United Nations and renews its traditional position on the search for peaceful and consensus solutions to
these issues.@@@This is an opportunity for my delegation to point out that, with regard to peace operations, since 1961, the Republic of Guinea has deployed and continues to deploy military contingents as well as police and gendarmerie personnel in various peace missions throughout the world.@@@It is on the strength of all this experience that the President of Guinea, Colonel Mamadi Doumbouya, an avowed pan-Africanist, has decided to deploy, in addition to the Guinean contingent in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali operating in Kidal, Mali since 2013, an additional contingent to replace that of Benin, whose mandate expires in 2023.@@@Furthermore, my country reiterates its commitment and insists on the fight against climate change and irregular migration.@@@We are convinced that the United Nations remains indispensable to our world.@@@However, it needs to be reformed in order to be fairer, more inclusive and better able to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the world’s peoples.@@@It must adapt to the realities of the world, meet the many challenges facing humankind and maintain its central role in global governance.@@@In this context, the Republic of Guinea attaches importance to the implementation of the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, which underpin the African Common Position, as declared by His Excellency Mr. Macky Sail, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, on Security Council reform.@@@The Republic of Guinea has adopted the same perspective as the United Nations in terms of inclusive dialogue, including with the Economic Community of West African States, being the guiding principle for our transition, strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights and accountability with a view to mending a weakened national fabric.@@@On behalf of the Guinean people, we thank our partners, in particular the United Nations system and bilateral and multilateral donors, for their support in this process.@@@Finally, my country reiterates its support for multilateralism, multilingualism and the revitalization of United Nations bodies, which are yet another asset for an international cooperation that is mutual, beneficial, inclusive and supportive of humankind and sustainable development, which is so much sought after and desired by the Member States.@@@May God bless Guinea and the Guinean people.@@@May God bless our planet.@@@On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to congratulate H.E. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and to wish him a fruitful work.@@@The Republic of San Marino supports the priorities of his programme and assures him of its full cooperation in all the work of the General Assembly.@@@I would also like to extend my special thanks to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations in these difficult and challenging times.@@@I am grateful for the theme chosen for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@It gives Member States the opportunity to constructively contribute to the work of the General Assembly.@@@The increasingly evident interrelationships among global challenges highlight the need for Member States, today more than ever, to work together to overcome difficulties.@@@It is clear that there is a link between multilateralism and global challenges, the scope of which goes beyond the capacity of each individual State, even the most powerful or technologically advanced, to face them on its own.@@@Preserving the values of multilateralism and international cooperation that underpin the Charter of the United Nations and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is of fundamental importance for promoting and supporting peace and security, development and human rights.@@@The Republic of San Marino considers it essential to continue to reaffirm its collective commitment to multilateralism, in particular in the framework of the General Assembly, as the most representative body of the United Nations on account of its deeply democratic nature, universal participation and undisputed legitimacy.@@@However, multilateralism cannot be a mere statement of collective intentions; it must translate into concrete actions to improve people’s lives and leave nobody behind.@@@We are facing difficult times, with an unprecedented level of violence, mass atrocities and displacement.@@@The armed conflicts across the globe are causing immense suffering to millions of civilians.@@@The war of aggression against Ukraine has had dramatic consequences for the civilian population, including civilian deaths, the destruction of vital infrastructure and massive displacement.@@@The aggression against Ukraine has been strongly condemned by the international community.@@@Resolution ES-11/1, “Aggression against Ukraine”, demands that Russia immediately stop its military aggression, unconditionally withdraw all forces from the entire territory of Ukraine, and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders.@@@San Marino has decided to cooperate within the framework of international structures and mechanisms, foremost among which is the United Nations, because it believes in the strength of dialogue, democracy and respect for others.@@@In line with our values, the Captains Regent of the Republic of San Marino, in their message at the opening of the session of the Parliament in July, called on all parties involved in the Ukraine conflict to renounce the use of force and to reopen the channels of dialogue and negotiation so that politics and diplomacy can prevail in the management of this crisis.@@@No one should remain indifferent to war, but rather we should all work responsibly to create the conditions for dialogue and peace with the full involvement of international institutions.@@@San Marino is deeply concerned by the ongoing armed conflicts across the globe.@@@We reaffirm our commitment to the principle of the responsibility to protect ,which is essential to the prevention of atrocity crimes.@@@Accountability is indeed another factor that plays an important role in preventing and stopping such crimes.@@@The Republic of San Marino reaffirms its full commitment to its obligations under human and humanitarian law, such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Geneva Conventions.@@@San Marino reaffirms its full support for the International Criminal Court, whose work is crucial in the fight against impunity for genocide and crimes against humanity and represents one of the core elements of the implementation of the responsibility to protect.@@@The ICC, through its work, fosters accountability and thereby promotes prevention and reconciliation.@@@The Republic of San Marino would also like to reiterate its support for initiatives such as the Code of Conduct of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group regarding Security Council action against genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity and the French and Mexican declaration on voluntary restraint of the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council.@@@Children and youth are uniquely and often disproportionately affected by conflicts and atrocities.@@@San Marino stresses the need to strengthen child protection capacities and to put children and youth at the centre of efforts to prevent atrocities.@@@At the same time, we also encourage Member States to adopt the relevant instruments on the protection of children, including the Paris Principles and the Safe Schools Declaration.@@@Being part of the Group of Friends of Children and Armed Conflict, San Marino is particularly worried about the difficulties in the implementation of child protection activities in armed conflict situations.@@@San Marino commends the dedication of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and of her Office, and appreciates the engagement of all the child protection personnel and partners involved.@@@Moreover, San Marino is committed to the protection of women and girls and to supporting the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence.@@@In addition, persons with disabilities face additional risks and vulnerabilities in situations of armed conflict.@@@Their needs should be duly taken into account and barriers to accessing information, evacuation and emergency assistance should be lifted.@@@San Marino is deeply disturbed and firmly condemns the growing number of deliberate attacks against schools, hospitals and places of worship.@@@We also firmly condemn attacks against journalists, humanitarian workers, human rights defenders and peacekeepers.@@@These stakeholders and civil society actors can play an important role for reconciliation and prevention and early warning mechanisms, and should therefore be supported and protected.@@@Today the threat of nuclear weapons being used is much higher than it has been in the last decades.@@@We condemn the Russian Federation’s dangerous nuclear rhetoric.@@@Any threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable and of the utmost concern.@@@What is needed today is a steady and genuine commitment to international institutions and to disarmament.@@@In that spirit, San Marino participated in the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in the first Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) earlier this year.@@@We regret that, at this critical time, the tenth Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was not able to adopt its final document.@@@San Marino will continue to work for the full implementation of this fundamental instrument.@@@San Marino welcomes the positive outcome of the first Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and urges all States committed to our final goal of a world without such weapons to join the TPNW.@@@Only honouring and reinvigorating our multilateral agreements will we be able to put humankind on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.@@@Since 1945, the world has witnessed the highest number of violent conflicts.@@@Forced displacement has continued to grow in 2021 and 2022, while refugees have been at their highest number.@@@The war in Ukraine has created one of the largest refugee crises of modern time.@@@More than 7 million refugees — most of them women and children — have fled Ukraine and a further 7 million have been displaced inside the country.@@@This refugee crisis confronts each Member State with its responsibilities.@@@The people of San Marino, guardians of a century- old tradition of peace and solidarity, have opened their doors to Ukraine refugees.@@@Since the beginning of the war, the Republic of San Marino has welcomed more than 300 Ukrainian refugees, equal to 1 per cent of the entire Sammarinese population, thanks to the solidarity of public and private institutions and non-governmental organizations and with the help of many volunteers.@@@Together with the refugee crisis, the impacts of the conflicts may lead to a global food crisis.@@@Food insecurity affects the lives of millions of people across the world and is mainly concentrated in conflict-affected regions.@@@The vast majority of stunted children live in countries affected by violence and conflict.@@@Armed conflicts displace farmers and can destroy agricultural assets and food stocks.@@@Furthermore, they disrupt markets and vital services for the food systems.@@@The ongoing war in Ukraine is disrupting supply chains and further affecting the prices of grain, fertilizer and energy.@@@In the first half of 2022, that caused further food price increases.@@@As reported in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022, the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet around the world rose by 112 million to almost 3.1 billion, reflecting the impacts of rising consumer food prices during the pandemic.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has further expanded the fragilities in our agri-food systems and the inequalities in our societies, and increased world hunger and severe food insecurity.@@@At the same time, we also should not underestimate the effects of climate change and climate disasters on aggravating food insecurity.@@@For all these reasons, it is extremely important to keep food security on our agenda and to continue to incentivize the sustainable production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods in order to make healthy diets less costly and more affordable to all.@@@Moreover, as promoter of resolution 74/209, establishing 29 September as International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, San Marino firmly believes that the fight against food loss and waste will contribute to promoting food security, and welcomes all initiatives aimed at developing awareness in such responsible behaviours.@@@It is widely acknowledged that the COVID-19 crisis has had a negative impact on global efforts to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@By the end of 2021, the deaths caused by COVID-19 were nearly 15 million.@@@With the overwhelming of global health systems and the disruption of many essential health services, the pandemic undermined years of progress in fighting other diseases, in particular in developing countries.@@@Compared with the pre-pandemic level, an additional 75 million to 95 million people will live in extreme poverty in 2022.@@@Billions of children have significantly missed out on schooling and over 100 million more have fallen below the minimum reading proficiency level.@@@Despite some encouraging signs, the global economy recovery struggles to grow due to COVID-19 variants and continued vaccine inequity, together with rising inflation, major supply-chain disruptions, policy uncertainties and unsustainable debt in developing countries.@@@The impact of climate change continues to be felt across the world.@@@COVID-19 has further delayed the urgently needed transition to greener economies.@@@Demand for coal, oil and gas rebounded with the economy in 2021 and will bring, over the current decade, an increase of global emissions by almost 14 per cent.@@@If current trends continue, the Earth could lose the natural wealth of its ecosystems, which would in turn jeopardize global food security, water supplies and livelihoods.@@@The interconnection of global crises—the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and armed conflicts across the globe — puts at great risk the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.@@@As the Secretary-General has called for in his Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), a renewed commitment to international cooperation is needed, but the United Nations must adapt quickly to the new global challenges in order to be more effective in carrying out its mandate.@@@Reforms must remain at the centre of our actions because they are crucial to future world stability and the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@We believe that Security Council reform should be an objective of all Member States.@@@That reform goal can be achieved only through a continuous dialogue among States and the awareness that overcoming respective initial positions is essential to negotiating the broadest agreement possible.@@@In conclusion, a stronger multilateralism is essential if we want to build fair, just and peaceful societies in which young people can live in dignity, women can have the same opportunities as men, and all minorities and vulnerable groups are protected.@@@I believe that the general debate is an important opportunity to renew our commitment to a stronger United Nations capable of coordinating economic, social and environmental policies and translating them into effective action at all levels.@@@The Republic of San Marino, in accordance with its history and its tradition of freedom and democracy, firmly believes in that mandate and will support any action that helps strengthen the United Nations in the process.@@@It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Republic of Serbia.@@@In view of our time limits, I ask everyone not to mind if I skip the burden of formalities, courtesy words and greetings to those who are present in or absent from this Hall, and instead speak directly about the essence of why we are gathered here.@@@I have been in this Hall so many times.@@@The seriousness of the present moment obliges me to share difficult but true words with the Assembly.@@@Everything we are doing here today seems at best relatively impotent and vague.@@@Our words are hollow and empty echoes compared to the reality we are facing.@@@And that reality is such that no one is listening to anyone here, no one strives to reach real agreements or resolve problems and almost all of us care only for our own interests, often breaching the basic principles of international law along the way and throwing away the Charter of the United Nations and other documents on which the Organization was founded.@@@That is not the fault of Antonio Guterres or anyone from the United Nations.@@@It is the fault of the Powers that care for nothing other than achieving their own political, economic and — unfortunately — military goals.@@@We are witness to the fact that the age we live in is characterized by a complex global geopolitical situation.@@@Our general debate is being held while world peace is being undermined to an extent not seen since the Second World War and the subsequent founding
of our United Nations.@@@The global challenges we are facing threaten to radically change the international security architecture and jeopardize the established international legal order.@@@Such complex times demand enormous wisdom and unity if we are to preserve peace as the absolutely most important heritage woven into the foundations of our Organization.@@@That is why I would like to speak clearly and accurately to the Assembly about five key challenges we are facing today.@@@The first is returning to peace and the preservation of global stability; the second is the preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of internationally recognized States — members of the Organization — as a key principle of international public law and relations between the countries; the third is energy security in the throes of a global crisis; the fourth is the financial safety of poor and developing countries; and the fifth and last is about food supplies in the wake of the interruption of global supply chains by war.@@@First, the current global developments increasingly remind us that there can be no alternative to the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes.@@@That principle stands out today more than ever, and is best described in the words of the Preamble to the Charter, which urge that we “practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours”.@@@Rejecting the use of force and ensuring the peaceful resolution of disputes are pillars of world stability, but they must be accompanied by principles such as non-selective observance of the Charter and the implementation of mandatory Security Council resolutions and the basic principles of the applicable international public law.@@@Secondly, regarding the preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of internationally recognized States, Serbia supports the territorial integrity of all States Members of the United Nations, including, of course, the territorial integrity of Ukraine.@@@In such a way, we behaved responsibly and seriously in this renowned institution.@@@Nevertheless, we can hear from many speakers stories about aggression and violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.@@@Many say that this was the first conflict on European soil since the Second World War.@@@But the truth that the territorial integrity of a country in Europe — Serbia, as a matter of fact — that did not attack any other sovereign country was violated is constantly unspoken.@@@We ask for a clear answer to the question that I have been asking my interlocutors, leaders of many countries, for years: what is the difference between the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia, which was grossly violated, and for which Member States, at least some, provided international recognition and legitimacy?@@@No one has ever provided a rational answer to that question.@@@Let me recall the fact that Serbia has never stepped on someone else’s territory, and neither has it endangered the territorial integrity of a single sovereign State so that anyone might intervene or carry out aggression against it in the way in which that was done against Serbia in 1999.@@@Nevertheless, as I said, that did not prevent the 19 richest NATO countries from attacking a sovereign country without a decision by the Security Council.@@@The signing, upon termination of the armed conflict, of the agreement with NATO, whose provisions envisaged the adoption of resolution 1244 (1999), and which confirmed and guaranteed the partial sovereignty and full territorial integrity of Serbia, did not prevent many Western countries from unilateral recognition of the independence of so-called Kosovo and from once again violating the territorial integrity of our country, the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 1244 (1999).@@@Owing precisely to such developments, which Serbia experienced and continues to experience, I am convinced that I am fully entitled to quote in this Hall the words of the great Martin Luther King: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”@@@Those words are carved like a reminder, but also as a warning to all of us.@@@Regardless of the fact that we still feel the consequences of the gross violation of the basic provisions of international public law, we do not give up on the United Nations founding principles.@@@We will continue to advocate consistent observance of the principle of the inviolability of borders and respect for the sovereignty and integrity of all other States Members of the United Nations.@@@Despite that position of ours, many in this Hall have issues with respecting the territorial integrity of Serbia.@@@Participants wonder why?@@@Because they have power in their hands and, in their eyes, we are small and weak.@@@However, as those present can hear and see, we have the strength to tell the truth, even here.@@@We owe special gratitude to all those States Members of the United Nations — and they currently constitute a majority at this Assembly — that support the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, particularly in the space and territory of Kosovo and
Metohija.@@@In addition, it is encouraging that the number of countries that support Serbia’s position increased in the period between the two sessions, which is a trend that must continue because it is of the utmost importance to remain loyal to the basic principles embedded in the United Nations Charter, such as the principle of the inviolability of borders.@@@The Republic of Serbia, and I as its President, search very patiently and with a great deal of goodwill for compromise regarding Kosovo and Metohija under the auspices of the European Union and within the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue.@@@It is a difficult process; it has lasted for more than 10 years, but we see no alternative to it.@@@It is better to negotiate for 100 years than to wage war for a single day.@@@I hope that we will reach a mutually acceptable solution, based on compromise, because that is absolutely the only way to reach our goal, which is long-lasting peace as a prerequisite for a prosperous life for Serbs and Albanians in an entire region.@@@We have exhausted all other options and, speaking for Serbia at least, we do not even dream about going back to the path of conflict and bloodshed.@@@The Balkan region could not stand another conflict.@@@I rely on the goodwill and understanding of our international partners because they well know that some earlier decisions by their Governments were bad ones and that they were not acting in favour of the future of our region and world peace.@@@Belgrade is running that process under very complex circumstances, with elements of a hybrid war and a dirty campaign in part of the international community against our country in various areas.@@@It is sufficient just to recall the quotes and allegations of the world media that Serbia would attack its neighbours and that Serbia was a threat to regional stability.@@@Of course, that never happened, and it was only one among numerous lies against the Republic of Serbia.@@@Serbia was featured as a potential destabilizing factor in the region only to be prevented from telling the truth — that the principle of the inviolability of borders must be equally applicable to all.@@@Serbia was, and will be, a factor for stability in the entire region.@@@Despite many untruths and falsehoods, Serbia supports the Dayton Peace Agreement, the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the integrity of Republika Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Meanwhile, we are convinced that the nations of the Balkans have the capacity to continue their lives in the future as friends and partners, with a common vision of membership of a united Europe.@@@I know that well because we have already overcome many barriers that stood between our nations for years and that cost us thousands of lives and wasted futures.@@@Serbia and Albania, for example, today have the closest and the friendliest relationship in the entire several-centuries- long common history in the area of the Balkan peninsula.@@@It took only clear-headed and pragmatic discussions about our future, not about our past, and talking about how to resolve the problems that were bothering our people, companies, workers, students and entrepreneurs.@@@We discussed a great deal and by ourselves reached numerous solutions that have already removed barriers that existed between us for no rational reasons.@@@First of all, in the economy, trade and flow of people and capital, for three years Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia have been implementing the Open Balkan initiative, which has a clear vision, namely, to open up the region for people, goods, services, capital and companies in order to create a space that would be permanently liberated from tensions and conflicts.@@@In addition to the unquestionable common economic benefit that the initiative brings, it has a broader dimension, first of all in connecting people with different cultures and in promoting diversity, which clearly contributes to the general development of society in that part of Europe.@@@In that way, Serbia actually continues to contribute to peace, stability and the reconciliation process in the region, whereby it certainly provides a significant contribution to global security.@@@We found the inspiration for the respective in the words of one of the greatest diplomats in history and a great Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, that this Organization “was not created to take mankind into paradise, but rather to save humanity from hell”.@@@From the moment we curbed the global pandemic, we already faced new, unprecedented challenges for this century.@@@While we, as humankind, take one step at a time in accelerated technological development, there are existential problems ahead of us, such as energy security and the financial safety of developing countries, but also distortions in the supply chains of basic food provisions.@@@Solidarity, which was necessary in fighting the pandemic, is needed to a far greater extent today, when people’s basic needs for food and energy are endangered.@@@The Republic of Serbia thinks of its energy security as an inseparable part of its national security and as the
key prerequisite for the continuation of the economic development and progress of our country.@@@We strive to provide the continuity of the energy supply, but we share the concern over the current geopolitical challenges that undermine energy stability in the world and in Europe.@@@We remain committed to finding solutions with the transformational strength to attain regional and European energy safety.@@@I would like to underline that the Republic of Serbia managed to preserve continuity in energy supply during the ongoing crisis.@@@Nevertheless, we remain vitally interested in diversifying supply sources through additional investment in energy infrastructure, but also in the faster and more efficient development of capacities based on renewables.@@@It is precisely at the United Nations that we named the ongoing decade the decade of action — for transformation towards a more sustainable and resilient future.@@@It must remain so, but at a slightly faster pace.@@@Unequal development and financial perils in developing countries cause additional social layering and inevitably bring new antagonisms.@@@Equal development must be neither limited nor conditioned geographically or politically; it must be provided to all people, regardless of ethnic, racial, cultural or religious affiliation.@@@There is another very important challenge ahead that we must overcome together — finding the most efficient way to mitigate the consequences of the current international crisis inflicted on global food supply security.@@@Developments in that regard are highly alarming, and the reality is such that all of us, with no exceptions, are struck by them.@@@The growing prices of food and its availability have become an additional problem.@@@The task for all of us is to find operational and efficient solutions that will leave no one behind.@@@It is up to us, States, as the most important international subjects, to participate individually in the coordination of measures, first of all, by contributing to this noble task at the national level in order to preserve what is most valuable — human lives and human dignity.@@@The topic of this year’s general debate alerts us to the importance of this moment and the relatedness of international challenges.@@@The crises we are facing remind us of the importance of open communication.@@@It does not take much wisdom to conclude that challenges can be successfully overcome only if their causes are properly identified.@@@Serbia believes that it is imperative that current challenges not deepen world divisions in any way and that already obvious and intentional polarization at global levels should give way to principles of multilateralism.@@@I would like to underline that the Republic of Serbia stands ready to take part in collective efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goals and to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace.@@@Serbia shares the Secretary-General’s vision of a future of global cooperation, as envisaged by Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), and it strongly supports inclusive, networked and efficient multilateralism as the best tool for responding to the most urgent challenges for humankind.@@@Multilateralism, collective action and common responsibility are critical elements of our discussions thus far, but I would like to underline that the starting point for each such constructive engagement is solidarity.@@@Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Republic of Serbia will continue to be a reliable partner in achieving the common goals defined within the United Nations framework, led by the firm belief that it is the best path to forge a new world for us and generations to come.@@@But we must not forget that the United Nations is as strong as our respect for the agreed decisions and documents of the Organization.@@@I would like to recall something that we have already heard uttered 23 times:@@@“The only standard we must follow is the Charter
of the United Nations.”@@@That is what we heard from everybody, but in the case of the Republic of Serbia, we saw that 17 of the 23 representatives speaking about the United Nations Charter and United Nations resolutions violated international law and did not follow the rules created and espoused by the United Nations.@@@I hope that we will be able to overcome all of those difficulties and to apply the rules and procedures equally for everyone.@@@Otherwise, I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel.@@@Long live Serbia.@@@My	delegation,	and by
extension, the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to the preside over the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and to wish him every success during his term.@@@We also express appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the able manner with which he presided over the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session.@@@Permit me to express my deepest condolences to His Majesty King Charles III, the royal family and the Government and people of the United Kingdom on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.@@@Her Majesty was a symbol of stability and continuity, not only for the United Kingdom but for the Commonwealth and the world at large.@@@The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is being convened at a time when we are facing innumerable challenges with both current and long-term implications.@@@They include climate change, the degradation of our ecosystem and loss of biodiversity, poverty, inequality and the growing challenge of chronic non-communicable diseases.@@@All of those have occupied the attention of this body over the years, with only marginal progress in finding solutions to them.@@@Compounding those challenges are other emerging threats, such as the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the war unfolding in Ukraine.@@@The invasion of one country by another must always be condemned, and Dominica has condemned the invasion of Ukraine without reservation.@@@In our interconnected world, what happens in one part of the world affects us all, and so it is with the war in Ukraine.@@@We are all victims of the skyrocketing prices of oil and petroleum products and the resulting impact on the cost of electricity and all aspects of transportation.@@@The cost of the production of goods and services is similarly adversely affected, and as Russia and Ukraine are among the leading suppliers of grain, the conflict has created a shortage in the world’s supply, with implications for hunger in countries that rely on imports from those two countries.@@@The developments since 2014 that led to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are well known.@@@Nevertheless, we in Dominica are of the view that the invasion
and the ensuing war could have been prevented.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore stands with the rest of the world in calling for an immediate cessation of the conflict that continues to rage in Ukraine.@@@We welcomed the deal brokered between Ukraine and Russia, with the assistance of Turkey and ably supported by the Secretary-General, to have significant quantities of grain shipped from Ukrainian ports to various destinations and thereby alleviate the emerging global food crisis.@@@For those reasons and in the interests of global peace, the Commonwealth of Dominica urges all the parties to continue upholding their end of the agreement so that further relief can be felt globally as a result.@@@Like most Member States, we in Dominica and the Caribbean were ill-prepared to deal with COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020.@@@Notwithstanding the fact that most countries have managed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and consequently eased the related restrictions, public health experts have warned that the pandemic is not yet over.@@@Furthermore, with new variants continuing to emerge, COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to the global community.@@@The pandemic has exposed the limitations of health systems in all countries large and small, developed and underdeveloped.@@@The reality is that not all people have equal access to vaccines and life-saving medicines, even when faced with a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization.@@@The theme for this year’s session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is analogous to the approach and trajectory outlined by the United Nations for the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Member States have individually embraced the SDGs as the ideal to be universally pursued and achieved by 2030.@@@Small island developing States (SIDS) face more challenges than most in achieving those goals.@@@The international community has pledged its support, but the question is to what extent such tangible support has been forthcoming.@@@The challenge is to go beyond promises, commitments and pledges to achieve effective delivery and implementation.@@@The various global crises do not respect national borders.@@@Our interconnected world means that no one is insulated or immune from developments taking place anywhere on the globe.@@@Today planet Earth is under severe threat and stress and may very well become uninhabitable if we delay decisive corrective action further.@@@We need to talk less and start taking the concrete and sustainable actions needed to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere.@@@In addition to tropical storms and hurricanes, we are facing prospects of droughts, warming seas and rising sea levels, all of which will affect lives and livelihoods.@@@For that reason, we continue to champion the call for collective global action in order to build on the resilience of our small island States in the face of natural disasters that are triggered and exacerbated by our changing climate.@@@We must lay a path for development that is sustainable and people-focused.@@@For a number of years, small States like ours have spoken from this very rostrum and many others like it across the world, seeking to convince the developed world to change the destructive practices threatening our planet and our very lives and livelihoods.@@@Yet despite our best efforts, not enough corrective action is being taken.@@@Not enough support is being given to us to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change that are already upon us.@@@I will not stand here today to detail to the Assembly the ways in which climate change is affecting us.@@@They are well known.@@@We see the news reports.@@@The evidence is all around us.@@@What we need from our developed partners in the United Nations family is recognition and acceptance of responsibility that translates to a commitment to providing the funding that is required to enable our small States to become resilient.@@@That must be readily accessible and available to all of us on grant and concessional terms, with the only criterion for access being our vulnerability to extreme weather events.@@@We have spoken here before of the cataclysmic impact of successive disasters on our country.@@@Tropical Storm Erika, in 2015, and Hurricane Maria, in 2017, caused more than 90 per cent and 226 per cent loss of gross domestic product (GDP), respectively, in terms of lives lost, people displaced and livelihoods shattered.@@@Those experiences triggered our goal of becoming the first climate-resilient nation in the world and realigned our focus to concentrate on adaptation efforts and building back better in every sector of the economy.@@@Our small island developing States are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change — a phenomenon that will continue to escalate with every increment of global warming.@@@As sea levels rise, some small island States will eventually disappear, while others will experience
coastal erosion that will ultimately destroy infrastructure, villages, towns and cities.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore reiterates its call on the international community, at the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to prioritize the disbursement of climate financing to SIDS in order to support our adaptation and resiliency efforts as we seek to minimize loss and damage from extreme climate events.@@@In that way, actions will reflect more equitable and justice-oriented responses to fulfilling the goals and promises of sustainable development.@@@Furthermore, the continuous call for higher levels of commitment to climate justice must be reflected in tangible and effective responses.@@@At Headquarter s two months ago, the Commonwealth of Dominica submitted its first voluntary national review in keeping with its international obligations and in the spirit of good global governance.@@@Dominica reported on the tremendous progress accomplished in terms of both the advances made towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and its national agenda as guided by the vision of becoming the world’s first climate-resilient nation.@@@As it continues to recover from the destructive weather events I mentioned, Dominica’s main economic industries are showing signs of positive recovery.@@@Tourism and agriculture remain the main income-generating sectors, with GDP projected to reach pre-pandemic levels by 2023, averaging 5 per cent growth per year from 2022 to 2026.@@@Tourism recovery has been supported by new infrastructure projects and improved and increased air access.@@@At the centre of Dominica’s resilience agenda are its citizens.@@@Across Dominica, new and modern climate-resilient homes are being constructed for low- and middle-income families, while modern and smart health and wellness centres have been built and equipped in urban and rural communities.@@@That will allow those communities to withstand the impact of extreme weather events and remain operational, while also strengthening their response to other natural emergencies and pandemics.@@@In that regard, the Commonwealth of Dominica takes this opportunity to commend the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its commitment to contribute an additional $42 billion to the new Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, which will assist countries such as Dominica that are on the front line of the negative impacts of climate change to accelerate the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Ensuring that our citizens enjoy long and healthy lives will always be a priority.@@@Therefore, what we grow and consume has to be a critical component of our resilience agenda.@@@Global trends indicate that issues surrounding food security are not unique to Dominica.@@@Indeed, under Sustainable Development Goal 2 — achieving zero hunger — Governments are called on to pursue smart and sustainable food production to help alleviate the perils of hunger.@@@Dominica is working to strengthen its agriculture sector in order to decrease the cost of the importation of food.@@@There is renewed emphasis on growing what we eat and eating what we grow, while at the same time ensuring that affordable and high-quality produce is available for export on a consistent basis.@@@Our aim is to develop a scientific and practical approach to reducing the vulnerability of farmers and fisherfolk through the adoption of resilient and sustainable practices.@@@We embraced the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as part of our international obligation vis-a-vis the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations, for the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@Dominica therefore calls on all nuclear- weapon States to abide by international law concerning the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the use of diplomacy as a tool in conflict resolution.@@@The trade and economic embargo imposed on our brothers and sisters in Cuba continues to be of great concern to us in the Caribbean, and its lifting has become more urgent in the light of the global impact on food security of the Russia-Ukraine war.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica continues to add its voice to those of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations to call for the immediate lifting of the unjustified trade restrictions and export bans imposed on the good people of Cuba.@@@It has long been established that, whatever the objectives were 60 years ago, when the embargo was instituted, it can no longer be justified — if it ever was.@@@The Government of Dominica therefore strongly urges the few States that continue to support those sanctions to heed the call of the overwhelming majority of us gathered here and lift the archaic and unfair embargo
against Cuba.@@@Let us all support the full integration of the Cuban people into the global financial and trading systems.@@@For decades, Cuba has been training medical doctors, nurses, engineers and other professionals, as well as providing technical assistance to developing countries, as part of its South-South cooperation.@@@Cuba also offers professional training in various disciplines to thousands of students from all over the developing world.@@@In addition, Cuba continues to add its voice to the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the rest of the world.@@@We therefore join all other Member States that have called for the removal of Cuba from the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, and we ask instead that we redirect our efforts to combating the real threats to global peace and security in the region.@@@In March 2015, the United States declared that Venezuela poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and imposed sanctions on that country.@@@The United States has been followed by several countries in imposing sanctions, since when the good people of Venezuela have endured severe hardship and suffering as a result of those numerous financial and economic sanctions, the consequences of which prevent millions of Venezuelans from meeting their most basic needs, a situation made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, further impacting Venezuela’s contracted economy and an already weakened health system.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica again joins the voices of many other States Members of the United Nations to call for the immediate lifting of the unjustified oil embargo and other general sanctions imposed on the people of Venezuela.@@@The political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela demands immediate attention.@@@It is further incumbent upon all of us to provide short- and long-term solutions and opportunities for Venezuela to resolve its challenges and quickly improve the lives of ordinary Venezuelans.@@@The current situation in Haiti continues to be of great concern to us and demands greater international attention.@@@An editorial in The Washington Post dated 6 August 2020 called for muscular international intervention.@@@That was followed by a statement from the Secretary General of the Organization of American States dated 8 August, in which he reproached the international community for its failure to assist Haiti over the years and for leaving the country in chaos.@@@Haiti is a country that was once the wealthiest colony in the Americas.@@@It is now the poorest country in the Western hemisphere.@@@The magnitude 7.0 earthquake of 2010 left the country totally devastated.@@@It claimed some 250,000 lives, left more than 300,000 people injured and laid waste the capital of Port-au-Prince and most of southern Haiti.@@@The cost of the damage done was estimated at $8 billion, and the cost of reconstruction at approximately $14 billion.@@@United Nations agencies report that some 1.3 million people suffer from food insecurity in Haiti and some 4.6 million from limited access to basic food supplies.@@@While I am pleased to acknowledge the recent special meeting of the lead Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community on Haiti held in Trinidad and Tobago, which sought specific solutions to the many crises that beset Haiti, the international community needs to respond as if Haiti were under invasion, as is the case in Ukraine, or as it did in the post-war reconstruction situation in Europe after the Second World War, requiring the so-called Marshall Plan.@@@Nothing less can overcome the deep-rooted reconstruction challenges facing Haiti.@@@We therefore urge the United Nations family to forge an effective and unified response that brings to bear the necessary resources — financial, technical, human and otherwise — to alleviate the suffering of the Haitian people.@@@The severe and massive impacts of the various challenges we have experienced in recent times highlights the importance of multilateralism.@@@As we raise the various issues confronting our individual States and share our hopes, fears and expectations, let us also seek to offer solutions to our various problems as a united international community, eager to realize a sustainable, transformative and fairer future for all.@@@In conclusion, allow me to reiterate my country’s gratitude to all our international partners and friendly Governments that have stood with the Commonwealth of Dominica, particularly through our darkest days following the major tropical storms and hurricanes that afflicted us.@@@Our journey is one of building back better, sustainability and resilience.@@@With their continued support, we look forward to a brighter future in the days ahead.@@@I wish all participants and representatives at the seventy-seventh session every success in their deliberations.@@@Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly and to thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed for their courageous leadership and commitment in very difficult times.@@@This year we come together again and the battles continue; indeed, they have grown.@@@What we have seen over the course of the summer and the course of this year with the war in Ukraine are the concomitant consequences for ordinary people all over the globe with respect to inflation, the scarce supply of goods and quite simply hardship.@@@The struggle for access to food continues, regrettably, to be the environment in which we live.@@@I had hoped that we would have seen improvement, but I am now convinced more than ever that there comes a time when we must heed a certain call, like the one made when others before us, when I was a student, sought to fight the great famine in Africa and came together as one world to make that definable difference.@@@Last year I asked us to do the same (see A/76/PV.12) and it may be, in the words of Jimmy Cliff, that we have to keep trying, trying and trying, but the world must stand up if our citizens are to live a better life.@@@I say this today because it is easy to come and only complain.@@@However, the truth is that it is within our power to make that difference and that definable change.@@@We must decide whether we want to stand for peace, love and prosperity, knowing that we choose to do so at the most difficult time and from the most difficult, deep place we have seen in a very long time.@@@I believe it is possible, but it is up to us to turn possibilities into realities.@@@What do I mean?@@@We have been speaking for a long time about the reform of this institution and the recognition that only one quarter of the States now in existence were present when this institution was formed.@@@Earlier this week, President Biden spoke of the need to reform the Security Council (see A/77/PV.6).@@@We echo that, but we go further because we believe that a Security Council that retains the power of the veto in the hands of a few will still lead us to war, as we have seen this year.@@@Therefore, the reform must not simply address the Council’s composition but also remove the veto.@@@We also believe that if the Group of Seven and the Group of 20, in their capacity as the world’s informal governance subcommittee, are to be fair, they must recognize that we can no longer accept that persons have to call year after year for the inclusion of the people of Africa and of African descent.@@@For how can the world have at its core a subcommittee that excludes more than 1.5 billion people of the world and then expect it to reflect fairness and transparency in its decision-making?@@@We ask that the determination be made by those countries, who must understand that if we are to move from possibilities to realities, we must embrace a transparent framework that allows our peoples, who are losing faith in their institutions and in the governance of the world, to understand that fairness means something — the ability for all to have a voice — and that we cannot only speak to it in the corridors of democracy within the nation State, and indeed it will be meaningful only when it is also reflected in our international community.@@@If I perhaps have one simple theme today, it is that fairness and togetherness are what is needed to bring about peace, love and prosperity in the world.@@@No, that is not romanticism.@@@Those are hard realities that simply require decisions.@@@That is why I use the language of that great anthem We Are the World, because there comes a time when we must heed a certain call, when the world must come together as one.@@@Yes, regrettably, there are too many people dying in conflict and as a result of the economic crisis, and the hand that we must lend to life comes in the decisions that we must make to reform and to fight for peace and not to fight to sustain war wherever it is found around the world; to fight for reform so that our citizens are not made victims of poverty due to the triple crisis of climate change, the pandemic and now the conflict that is causing the inflationary pressures that have regrettably led to people taking circumstances into their own hands, as we have seen in Haiti in the last week.@@@Any attempt to increase fuel prices by 150 per cent in any part of the world would be met with great consternation and anger by populations on fixed incomes.@@@But when that happens in one of the poorest countries in the world that has been trying for almost 230 years to find stability, against the backdrop of the exploitation that it has faced, we ask ourselves what it will take for the world to stand up and be counted for the people of Haiti.@@@Similarly, we ask for the same transparency with regard to the removal of the blockade against the people of Cuba.@@@This is the thirtieth year in which a resolution has called for the removal of that blockade, but the blockade has been there for 60 years.@@@I simply say to the people of the United States of America not to be short-sighted in their goals, for in this hemisphere peace and prosperity is the province of all.@@@Yes, there may be problems on both sides, but there is nothing that justifies further hardship for people because of ideological differences.@@@If there are human rights differences, let us resolve them, as we have chosen to do with mighty countries across the world without the imposition of sanctions.@@@Fairness and transparency demand it of us.@@@I also want to talk about other solutions that we believe can alter our condition without imposing the burden of taxation that is unreasonably sown on the populations of the world.@@@As I said last year, we live in a world in which the disparity in income is too great, in which some are even disproportionately and egregiously benefiting from crises.@@@We must ask ourselves, therefore, whether the time has not come for a review of the settlement of the Bretton Woods institutions, which no longer serve in the twenty-first century the purpose that they served in the twentieth century, when they were catering to one quarter of the nation States that are now members of this institution.@@@We ask ourselves whether the time has not come for our voices to collectively demand such a review through the boards of directors of the respective institutions.@@@Why do I say that?@@@The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is really what the World Bank is.@@@Maybe if we referred to that continuously, we would remind ourselves that the purpose of reconstruction and development must be appropriate to the century in which we live, a century that not only demands of us the eradication of poverty, which remains a noble goal, but equally demands of us the protection of global public goods.@@@All of us here have suffered as a result of the weakest among us being unable to rise to the occasion to protect public health.@@@All of us now know what it is to be on the front line of the climate crisis.@@@Years ago, we spoke about small island developing States being on the front line because we were the canaries in the coal mine.@@@Today we speak about all countries and about this hot summer — from wildfires in California to heat waves in North America and Europe, waterways in Europe being unpassable by vessels, floods in China and, above all, the apocalyptic floods in Pakistan, for which our hearts go out to the people of that country.@@@It simply cannot continue.@@@Any attempt to deny that the climate crisis has humanmade origins is an attempt to delude ourselves and an admission that we want to be accomplices in the continued death, loss and damage that ensue for the people who are victims of the crisis.@@@Our people demand better of us.@@@We believe that today the most appropriate place to deal with global public goods is in fact the World Bank Group.@@@I will speak more to this tomorrow, but I want to say simply that, if multinational companies have contributed to the global public risk — or if they benefit from the solutions for global public goods — then they ought to contribute to its resolution through a small percentage of their profits.@@@That funding would be used to address the needs of countries, whether in relation to climate stability, resilience and adaptation; the protection of biodiversity, both on land and in our waters; the protection of public health against the next pandemic, either a slow-motion pandemic of antimicrobial resistance or another that we have not even contemplated; the provision of education for all of our citizens, because to remain on Earth without the benefit of education is to be sentenced to life imprisonment from a young age; access to electricity, given that 600 million people in Africa are without it; or access to broadband, the equivalent in our age to the right to knowledge and prosperity.@@@Of course, as I said to the United States Congress last week, we must also address countries’ needs in relation to, believe it or not, the right to a bank account, because countries across the world are being denied the right to access correspondent banking, leaving their citizens and economies to function as financial pariahs in a world that is supposed to be globally interdependent in terms of the movement of capital.@@@The provision of that funding to promote public goods at a global level is critical if we are to make a difference going forward and achieve the peace, love and prosperity to which I referred earlier.@@@I want to commend the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its rapid financing mechanism at the beginning of the pandemic crisis and for the Resilience and Sustainability Trust that is soon to be launched.@@@It is the first recognition that middle-income countries should be able to access funding irrespective of per capita income, depending on their climate vulnerability.@@@To those who recommend this to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, we say that they should not simply recommend it for countries following a disaster but also for countries before a disaster.@@@Every dollar that is spent on research, as they have done, saves $7 in expenditure avoided, not to mention the lives saved.@@@We do not want only to pay the undertaker, we want to save lives.@@@I asked the IMF to reflect on the fact that the Resilience and Sustainability Trust may need to be delinked from quotas if it is to be effective.@@@I am conscious that will depend on more countries seeding the Trust with capital and more countries agreeing perhaps to allow their special drawing rights to be used for that purpose, just as we asked them to allow those special drawing rights to be used to enable multilateral development banks to significantly increase the money that is available to countries, particularly at this time when we are on the verge of a debt crisis, with more than 45 countries facing the heat of the moment due to the increased cost of capital resulting from the monetary policies being put in place to fight the virulent cancer of inflation.@@@We want to thank those countries that have come together to help us continue financing the Sustainable Development Goals, which we link to the global public goods.@@@Why?@@@Because they are fundamentally the right
to development and the right to give each person the ability to live a good life.@@@We cannot get lost in the conflict, the climate crisis and the pandemic and forget what our mission is.@@@I commend those that continue to remember that and ask that we reach a global compact.@@@Financing for development cannot be short-term; it needs to be at least 30-year financing.@@@The world recognized that when it allowed Britain to participate in the refinancing of its World War bonds, which were only paid off eight years ago, 100 years after the First World War started.@@@Or when it allowed Germany to cap its debt service at the equivalent of 5 per cent of its exports, conscious that the cataclysmic experience of war would not have allowed it to finance reconstruction while repaying debts incurred for war.@@@We are no different today.@@@We have incurred debt for the coronavirus disease and the climate, and now in order to fight this difficult moment of inflationary crisis and uncertain supply of goods.@@@Why, therefore, must the developing world now seek to find money within seven to 10 years when others had the benefit of longer time frames to repay?@@@Finally, I want to deal with the issue very quickly and to impress on the Assembly that all of those things have been the subject not just of idle thought or arbitrary comment on our part.@@@We had the good fortune in Barbados of collecting a large number of persons from civil society and academia at the end of July and the beginning of August, and we settled on what we have come to call the Bridgetown Agenda, which we believe to be an agenda for peace and prosperity inspired by the love of humankind.@@@It is that agenda that speaks to the reform of the Bretton Woods architecture.@@@We have asked, and will ask, countries and people to join it because we believe that, unless we take responsibility for ourselves and accept that we are the world, we will not see a change.@@@As I come to the issue of climate change, which will dominate over the next 45 to 48 days as we head to Egypt, let us remember that the trust that is needed to propel us to fight the great causes of our time will not be won by breaching promises.@@@The developing world, in particular the small island developing States, went to Paris and agreed to a global compact thanks to one of its key aspects, the promise concerning loss and damage.@@@Today the people of Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico, and yesterday those of the Turks and Caicos Islands — and little do we know what will happen in Bermuda — face the difficulty of disruption by Hurricane Fiona.@@@This morning I received news of difficulties concerning our own natural gas supply in my country, and I suspect that others will experience difficulties in this part of the world due to the facilities and installations being affected in Puerto Rico.@@@This comes at a time when access to that commodity has already been affected by the war in Ukraine and the decision by Russia to cease the supply to Europe.@@@When we match this with the reality that we have not planned in granular form our capacity to meet the commitments we have made for net zero — I am a big defender of net zero, as the Assembly knows — then I see trouble ahead.@@@We must pause and get it right.@@@Our small States are making commitments that the world wants to hear.@@@However, when those commitments are undermined by the inability to supply the electric cars or batteries necessary to sustain renewable energy, then we know we have a problem.@@@That is why natural gas has been viewed as a bridge to clean energy.@@@But when the very access to natural gas is also affected, one understands better why emerging market countries in the Caribbean, including my own, and in Africa have determined that they cannot abandon access to their own natural gas resources until they are assured of having the capacity to sustain their populations.@@@That is where the rubber meets the road.@@@I ask us to recognize that those commitments on loss and damage and that granular detail matching commitment to capacity are absolutely critical if we are to make serious progress in saving our world.@@@We know that our world needs to be saved.@@@I want to salute Denmark for its commitment on Tuesday to offer $13 million towards a loss and damage fund, because it represents the first acknowledgement by a North Atlantic country that there is a justified need and justice in the demand for that loss and damage claim.@@@I ask us to recommit ourselves to the big matters
and to recognize that, if we do not speak truth to our population or explain and have the mature conversations rather than relying on headlines and sound bites, we will find a disconnect between those who are governed and those who govern.@@@Therefore, let us move to the task with dispatch — not to make sound bites but to have difficult conversations to secure the peace of the world and the prosperity of our people and to underpin those with a love for humankind, the original purpose that this Organization was formed to achieve.@@@In the words of that same song: let us lend a hand to life, for it is the greatest gift of all.@@@We cannot pretend day by day that someone somewhere else is going to make that change.@@@This is our family, this is our world and this is our time to make that defining difference.@@@Many of the things that are put before us today do not require money, but they require a commitment and political will.@@@With the power of the pen, we can impose natural disaster and pandemic clauses in our debt arrangements, and we can change the capital that is available to multilateral development banks so as to remove current barriers to us fighting poverty.@@@With those commitments, we can make a difference in today’s world.@@@Let us do so, recognizing that a world that reflects an imperialistic order, hypocrisy and a lack of transparency will not achieve that mission, but one that gives us freedom, transparency and a level playing field will make that definable difference.@@@We gather this year at a time of enormous challenges.@@@Geopolitical conflicts, mass displacement, food insecurity and the effects of the pandemic continue to make people suffer around the globe and pose massive threats to human security.@@@We need more ambition and effective action to fight climate change.@@@In short, we are off track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The conclusion to be drawn from all of that should be obvious to all — we urgently need to recall our commitment to leave no one behind and to come together for the sake of our common interests, embrace multilateralism and redouble our political investment in the United Nations.@@@Instead, we are witnessing a frontal assault on the very Charter of the United Nations.@@@The aggression against Ukraine is nothing less than an attack on the international world order established after the Second World War.@@@Indeed, that order, which we have all built up together and is best represented right in the General Assembly Hall, is being challenged in its very foundation.@@@This act of aggression, carried out with complete disregard for the most basic rules of international law, is an unprecedented test to our resolve to stand up together for our international order.@@@We in Liechtenstein are committed to defending our freedom.@@@We have joined with partners from our region, particularly the European Union, but also from other parts of the world, to stand united with Ukraine and to stand against aggression, wherever it is committed.@@@We have witnessed dramatic events in the past few months, developments of historic dimensions for the United Nations — a military build-up on the borders of one of the founding Members of this Organization, meeting the threshold of the threat of use of force foreseen in the United Nations Charter, accompanied by denial and disinformation.@@@After the military attack on Ukraine commenced, the Security Council was blocked yet again, predictably, through the veto.@@@However, for the first time in decades, it then invoked the Uniting for Peace resolution and handed its competence over to the General Assembly.@@@The resolution adopted in this Hall with an overwhelming majority (resolution ES-11/1) on 2 March will stand out as a landmark in the history of the United Nations.@@@Condemning the aggression against Ukraine in unequivocal terms was of enormous importance.@@@It backs the international response to that assault on our rules-based order.@@@Just as important, it lays the foundation for what we should do going forward — hold criminally accountable the political and military leaders who initiated the aggression committed against Ukraine.@@@The source of all the crimes committed in Ukraine is the crime of war itself.@@@Therefore, as President Zelenskyy also made clear in his address to the Assembly this week (see A/77/PV.7), addressing the crime of aggression is a powerful deterrent to help defend the international order reflected in the United Nations Charter.@@@The newly announced sham referendums for parts of occupied Ukraine are a continuation of the aggression and make a mockery of the right to self-determination — a cornerstone of the United Nations Charter and the international order.@@@This is also a moment for us to not just reflect on the future role of this Organization, but to decide together which United Nations the planet needs today.@@@This Organization is playing a crucial role in the current global challenges in the areas of humanitarian assistance, global public health, nuclear safety and food security.@@@It enjoys strong support and high levels of trust among the wider public.@@@At the same time, it continues to disappoint, especially in its core task — the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@Its mission “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is deeply ingrained in the collective conscience of the peoples on whose behalf it works.@@@But more often than not, it does not meet those expectations.@@@For us in Liechtenstein, maintaining peace and security remains the core purpose of this Organization.@@@And we remain committed to being part of the change required to have the United Nations at the centre of that effort, through prevention, mediation and collective action.@@@In that spirit, Liechtenstein put before the Assembly the veto initiative, adopted earlier this year (General Assembly resolution 76/262).@@@I wish to thank all the partners that supported that idea, and I am grateful for the way it continues to resonate far outside this building.@@@The veto initiative, of course, introduces a very important measure of accountability for the use of the veto.@@@But more important, it creates a policy space for the Assembly to step in when the Security Council is paralysed or deadlocked, as it may well be on frequent occasions in future.@@@The veto, indeed, is no longer the last word.@@@In some of the ongoing conflicts, we are witnessing the use of military force in its most crude and brutal form.@@@But in parallel, we are also dealing with cyberwarfare, which has added an insidious and often invisible layer of challenges to our collective security.@@@Liechtenstein is a small country in the heart of Europe.@@@We do not have armed forces.@@@Therefore, we must rely solely on respect for the rule of law and on strong partnerships in the region and beyond.@@@We are certainly shocked by the frontal assault on the European security architecture.@@@And we are horrified that military force, in its crudest form and against our hopes and beliefs, is being applied again in our part of the world.@@@And yet, in thinking about our national security, our biggest concern is the insidious ways in which cyberspace is used to undermine democratic institutions — the foundations of our societies and the very basis of our prosperity and of the peace we have enjoyed for long decades.@@@Addressing those threats and enforcing international law in cyberspace is therefore one of the key challenges we must face.@@@When addressing the Assembly in the past, Liechtenstein has regularly talked about the nexus between peace and justice and about the need to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes under international law, if we are to be successful in our efforts to achieve lasting peace.@@@Time and again — in Myanmar, in Syria and elsewhere — we have witnessed how impunity has led to more and often even graver atrocities, to crimes against humanity and to genocide, causing immense human suffering, destroying societies and destabilizing whole regions.@@@The aggression against Ukraine is but the most recent illustration of that sad pattern.@@@This war is not only illegal in and of itself, but it is also carried out with systematic disregard for international humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Conventions, mirroring the playbook of the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.@@@As a long-standing supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC), we supported the referral of the situation in Ukraine to the ICC.@@@That referral is a decisive test in two ways — of the effectiveness of the Court and of our consistency in lending the Court political and financial support.@@@This is our chance to illustrate our resolve — not just to prosecute crimes committed in Ukraine, but to give steady support to an ICC that does its work independently, across the globe and fully in line with its founding treaty, the Rome Statute.@@@Our work to address the Organization’s role to safeguard peace and security must embrace a comprehensive notion of security, with climate change being one of the key threats.@@@Every year, natural disasters and extreme weather events increase in severity and frequency.@@@Yet our collective understanding of the threat is not matched by the determination to move forward together with the required sense of urgency.@@@Progress in climate negotiations has been insufficient, and the pandemic, armed conflicts and challenges to energy supplies have done their part to contribute to a negative outlook.@@@Our collective action in the framework of the process of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will remain instrumental.@@@But it may well not be enough, in and of itself, to achieve the goals we have set ourselves in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Many of
our friends are contemplating legal avenues to fight climate change.@@@And in line with our commitment to the rule of law, we are open to working with them@@@In conclusion, protecting the planet and saving the livelihoods of future generations are the biggest challenges of our time and the ultimate test of our ability to be truly united nations.@@@It is our duty to take action together in order to ensure that no person, no country and no region is left behind.@@@Everyone committed to those goals will find a reliable partner in us.@@@The Republic of Cabo Verde encompasses the inhabitants of the 10 islands that make up the national territory, located in the mid-Atlantic, off the West African coast, and an immense diaspora, which is our eleventh island, scattered across the four corners of the world.@@@As President of the Republic and the highest representative of this global nation, I have the enormous privilege of extending my greetings to the entire General Assembly and, from this rostrum, to bring mantenhas — “greetings”, in the mother tongue of Cabo Verde — from Cabo Verdeans to the peoples of the world represented in this Hall by their highest dignitaries, expressing our best wishes for prosperity and happiness for all.@@@We look forward, with hope, to the Summit of the Future in 2023, as foreseen in the Secretary-General’s proposal expressed in “Our Common Agenda” (A/75/982), so that it may effectively help “forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like, and what we can do today to secure it”.@@@With that in mind, Cabo Verde reiterates before the General Assembly its firm intention to continue being an active and useful member of the United Nations system, acting and articulating its action on four major fronts, from the more specific to broader: to fully assume its responsibility in the framework of national governance; to value its specificity and grow from its status as a small island developing State; to be a spokesperson in the context of the diversity of and the designs for Africa, the continent to which it belongs; and, ultimately, to continue to be a champion of multilateralism for the advancement of the causes of progress and well-being of humankind.@@@In their journey, small island development States (SIDS) face such structural limitations as geographical remoteness and isolation, their small economic dimension and dependence on imports and high costs, on the one hand, and exports of sector-concentrated services, on the other, which more frequently and intensely expose them and make them vulnerable to the impact of external shocks, whether climate-related, economic or of other nature, such as pandemics and geopolitical conflicts.@@@For example, my country, Cabo Verde, in the past 15 years — between 2007 and 2022 — has suffered the economic and social impact of multiple crises: the economic and financial crisis of 2007-2008, at the very moment when we graduated from the list of least developed countries; the coronavirus disease pandemic, which caused a recession of 14.6 per cent in 2020; the ongoing inflationary impact of world events; and, in the last five years, one of the most profound and most serious droughts in the recent history of the country.@@@But like other small island developing States, Cabo Verde has the ambition to become a small island developed State.@@@In order to achieve that, Cabo Verde will have to progressively overcome its vulnerabilities and increase its resilience, and for this, it is imperative to be able to count on external solidarity in terms of sustainable financing and indebtedness, albeit always in a process and a logic of gradual reduction of the need for external support.@@@Although this is not a new narrative, it is nevertheless urgent that it be implemented, since with fewer than eight years to go before the culmination of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, all signs and indicators suggest that we are not moving at the desired pace for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by that date.@@@It is also pressing because less than two years before the fourth SIDS Conference, in 2024, it is certainly legitimate and expected that the Conference make a transformative decision on the best evaluation indicators and the policy modalities that will best support SIDS in meeting the goals of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway.@@@Cabo Verde has already submitted its application to host, in 2023, the regional preparatory meeting of the SIDS members of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and South China Sea region, to which it belongs, and is also prepared to monitor and support the whole process up to the conclusion of the General Conference in 2024.@@@It is within this context of emergency that we welcome the Secretary-General’s recommendation and the decision of the President of the General Assembly to establish a United Nations high-level expert panel
to conduct the effort, including the completion and use of a multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI).@@@We look forward to a satisfactory conclusion of the work of the high-level panel, and, in particular, that the General Assembly may adopt its MVI proposal, which we hope will be accepted and used in a consensual manner both inside and outside the United Nations.@@@After all, we, the SIDS, also want to free ourselves from the dependence on external support, which necessarily entails reducing our vulnerabilities, while also being aware of the duty to do our homework, to be competitive and resilient, and to achieve inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth.@@@Since 2015, Africa’s cultural and natural, material and immaterial heritage has been celebrated around the world to raise awareness and sensibility on the importance of its preservation.@@@The African Union therefore proposed the theme “Arts, culture and heritage: levers to build the Africa we want” as the theme for the year 2021.@@@However, in this regard, there are still questions about urgencies and the measures to be taken.@@@In my capacity as President of Cabo Verde, and counting on my African counterparts, I propose investing in the preservation of the natural and cultural heritage of the whole of Africa and reflecting on how to promote climate justice and equity in Africa and for Africa.@@@It is a question of striving to reach consensus on a more flexible and less abstract notion of climate equity that places common but differentiated responsibilities at the heart of a public and global debate, and to create a common platform for Africa, with view to transferring responsibilities from one generation to the next.@@@Accordingly, I must refer to the worldwide movement to support the candidacy of Creolization and Creole Cultures for the World Heritage List, for which I have accepted to be sponsor and spokesperson, as Cabo Verde was the first Creole society in the world.@@@This is a civil society-led initiative, which seeks for Creole countries to be able to position themselves with one voice as to their intangible heritage, promoting peace, friendship between peoples and development cooperation, based on the values that creolization has brought to civilization and a new ethos based on tolerance, diversity and fusion of cultures.@@@Accordingly, we call for strong political support and engagement from dignitaries of Creole countries and their Heads of State.@@@The adoption of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs was a high point for multilateralism, and its progressive implementation and realization should continue to benefit from the impetus of an increasingly renewed and reinvigorated multilateralism anchored on the United Nations system.@@@This has not happened at the desired level on the various fronts where, unfortunately, global challenges remain, while, at the same time, crises that have constituted genuine obstacles to progress have emerged, endangering the desired reinvigorating of multilateralism adapted and prepared to deal with the scale and complexity of the new challenges.@@@In this regard, Cabo Verde advocates an effective, inclusive, preventive, dissuasive and cooperative multilateralism, which could, as has already been stated, establish, a new global agreement between States, as well as a new global governance for the international system.@@@We advocate a multilateralism that calls for less confrontation between blocs and greater cooperation among Member States in the construction and delivery to all of such global public goods as peace and security, human rights and sustainable development.@@@Finally, we call for a multilateralism that is useful and facilitates a more peaceful international context, which opens the doors for countries, such as Cabo Verde, to more external funding and more and better integration in regional and global value chains.@@@In conclusion, I wish the General Assembly fruitful deliberations during this seventy-seventh session, the results of which we hope may pave the way for and prepare the Summits of the Future and the SIDS Conference, in 2023 and 2024, respectively.@@@The future is to be found in each day that lies ahead, but also in the solutions we take and make possible in each of these days.@@@We extend our best wishes to the United Nations.@@@After unprecedented formats of our General Assembly, following the constraints related to the coronavirus disease pandemic, we are again gathered here under the same roof to calmly debate the problems that disrupt the life of our world.@@@The objective is to restore our common Organization to its fundamental values and principles, which have been severely tested by geopolitical rivalries, the temptation to dominate, national withdrawal and conflicts.@@@I would therefore like to welcome the theme chosen to guide the general debate of this session: “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@But before I continue, allow me to extend to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session my warmest congratulations on his election and our best wishes for success.@@@I can assure him of my delegation’s support.@@@I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor for the work he accomplished in a rather difficult context.@@@On behalf of the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, I would like to pay a warm tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his various initiatives to make our Organization more efficient.@@@During its 77 years of existence, the United Nations has worked tirelessly to prevent conflicts and maintain international peace and security.@@@Today the threat to peace has changed.@@@The inter-State conflicts of yesteryear have been replaced by new forms of violence involving actors who are difficult to capture.@@@Africa, spared for the time being, has become a sanctuary for terrorist groups.@@@The terrorist threat, long confined to the countries of the Sahel, is spreading to the coastal countries on the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa.@@@That is why the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, has never ceased to invest personally in peace and stability in West Africa, and particularly in the Sahel.@@@That determination has enabled the President of the Republic, as mediator in the crisis between the brotherly countries of Cote d’Ivoire and Mali, to obtain the release of three of the 46 remaining Ivorian soldiers.@@@I would like to encourage all parties to show restraint and patience so that mediation can succeed.@@@The recent terrorist attacks in northern Togo, which left casualties and significant material damage in their wake, demonstrate the increasingly sophisticated means used by the jihadists.@@@That situation is of the utmost concern to my delegation.@@@That is why we welcome the adoption by consensus of the annual progress report of the Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International and National Security on 29 July.@@@Togo remains firmly committed to combating such criminals and driving them beyond its borders.@@@In that regard, we will never waver.@@@In order to contribute to that pressing goal, Togo hosted the first Pan-African Cybersecurity Summit in Lome on 23 and 24 March.@@@The Lome Declaration resulting from the Summit is a commitment to combating cyberthreats.@@@In that context, my country welcomes the work under way in the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes and encourages all stakeholders to engage in developing such a legal instrument.@@@Beyond the military response, we are fully aware that the fight against terrorism also depends on the degree of trust between the army and the population and between the latter and the Government.@@@We therefore work daily to combat the root causes of the spread of violent extremism, which fuels terrorism.@@@Togo also took innovative and multisectoral measures, as set out in its strategy document to combat violent extremism, adopted on 1 July.@@@To that end, an emergency programme for the Savannah region, with a budget of $9,104,704, was drawn up for the implementation of various projects up to 2025 in the water, energy, health, infrastructure, education and agriculture sectors.@@@We are in a new phase of the asymmetric war against that terrorist insurgency.@@@The deterioration of the security situation must be of concern to us all, particularly the United Nations.@@@To that end, it is important to successfully revitalize our Organization and do our utmost to reform the Security Council.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Global Programme on the Protection of Vulnerable Targets, from which my country, Togo, benefits as a pilot country.@@@That United Nations Programme, aimed at strengthening the capacities of Member States and providing them with logistical support for the protection of vulnerable targets against terrorist attacks, has proved to be of great importance to our countries.@@@The other major challenge facing humankind is climate change.@@@All the experts’ reports on that issue are worrisome.@@@That phenomenon is all the more of concern because it affects all countries in the world, including, unfortunately, the least polluting countries, such as ours.@@@Togo adopted a robust policy for the restoration of vegetation cover, with an ambitious programme for a green transition.@@@The Togolese Government is firmly committed to ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources and resilience to the impact of climate change.@@@With a view to sustainable management and protection, the Togolese Government has therefore focused its priorities, among other things, on improving marine and coastal ecosystems, regulating fishing and promoting the blue economy.@@@Lastly, as part of the preservation and restoration of ecosystems and combating desertification, Togo launched a major national reforestation programme of 1 billion trees by 2030, banned the import, marketing and use of glyphosate and all products containing it and promoted the use of biopesticides and biofertilizers in the country.@@@We very much hope that the upcoming twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt from 7 to 18 November, will help to bring environmental conservation back to the centre of the international agenda by urging stakeholders to honour the financing pledges needed to address global warming.@@@In the area of renewable energy, Togo established strategic partnerships for the provision of reliable, modern and low-cost services in rural areas.@@@Consequently, the fund for access to electricity for all, called the Tinga fund, the Cizo, or Sun, project for the supply of solar-energy kits to rural and vulnerable populations, photovoltaic power plants, miniature solar power plants and solar street lamps were set up throughout the country, contributing to the widespread use of renewable energy in Togo.@@@On the economic and social front, Togo adopted a Government road map up to 2025, whose vision is to make Togo a modern nation with inclusive and sustainable growth.@@@The road map has three main axes, namely, strengthening inclusion and social harmony and ensuring peace, boosting job creation by building on the economic potential and modernizing the country by strengthening its structures.@@@The reform of the business climate enabled Togo to significantly increase foreign direct investment in the country.@@@Similarly, the strengthening of development cooperation has contributed to the increased mobility of foreign resources due to the new momentum created by the adoption of the Government’s road map and its endorsement by development stakeholders, the establishment of new partnerships and the revitalization of existing partnerships.@@@The major challenge for Togo is to implement and strengthen its national social protection system.@@@Improving people’s access to basic social services and strengthening inclusion mechanisms also remain fundamental to poverty reduction.@@@To achieve that, the Government has included the principle of leaving no one behind in public policies.@@@As a result, other innovative initiatives have made it possible to expedite the inclusion of all social groups.@@@Those include the adoption of the law establishing universal health insurance and the WEZOU digital platform, set up in 2021, to take care of pregnant women and newborns in order to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality.@@@Strengthening women’s protection against discrimination and gender-based violence and reducing sociocultural barriers have considerably improved the contribution of the female population to the country’s development.@@@Togo set up a mechanism for the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable sectors of the population through cash transfers.@@@A project for the development of social-safety nets and basic services, as well as a programme to support vulnerable populations, was established.@@@In addition, an incentive mechanism for agricultural financing based on risk-sharing and a plan
to structure and improve rural agricultural training and integration were launched.@@@To conclude my remarks, I would like to encourage everyone to consider the foundations of multilateralism and the aims of the founding fathers in devising that system of global governance.@@@At the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly, we had a wide-ranging debate on the United Nations we want and reaffirmed our commitment to multilateralism.@@@The important declaration (resolution 75/1) adopted at the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations adequately reflects the new multilateral ambition to which we committed, and which, moreover, aims to be just and equitable.@@@It also seeks to show us that we are the driver of development and sustained global growth.@@@Today we are called on to take concrete action to address the many challenges that plague our world, including terrorism and security challenges, as well the coronavirus disease.@@@However, unfortunately, we see that all too often we flout our multilateral commitments.@@@We have at times taken away their substance, their strength and their roots.@@@How else can we understand why the Security Council remains so exclusive?@@@Why not work in good faith to reform that important organ of the international security system by making it more representative of the current world realities?@@@Based on that analysis, we come to the following conclusion.@@@Today we are convinced that African countries, and Africa in general, no longer want to align themselves with any of the major Powers due to the shortcomings of the concept of multilateralism.@@@The role attributed to Africa in the twenty-first century reflects the image that certain Powers still have of our continent as solely their area of influence.@@@Africa has virtually no impact on the current world order, while it is drastically affected by the consequences of the disruptions in international affairs.@@@It is only of interest to certain Powers when they find themselves in trouble.@@@We must be concerned about Africa’s place on the world stage.@@@In truth, today Africa does not occupy the place that it should in the international arena.@@@For many Powers, the African continent has no role to play as a major actor, in the Kantian sense of the word, in the international arena.@@@They think that they live in the same world, whereas the world has profoundly changed.@@@When the United Nations was established in 1945, apart from two African countries that we all know — Liberia and Ethiopia — African countries were not yet independent.@@@After 77 years, unfortunately, it is the same international system that remains in place because of the will of the five permanent members of the Security Council, known to us all.@@@Although the African integration project is still in progress, a consensus has since emerged among African States at the level of the African Union, as recalled at this session by the President of Senegal, Chairperson of the African Union, with regard to the need for the continent to obtain two permanent representative seats on the Security Council, in addition to the two non-permanent member seats allocated to African States (see A/77/PV.4).@@@Despite the general consensus of 54 Member States, the reluctance of some of the five permanent members to see Africa take up those seats is clear.@@@Unfortunately, Africa’s voice does not seem to be heard, as some simply do not want Africa to be a strong continent.@@@The great Powers want to reduce Africa to a merely functional entity in the service of their causes and clearly do not want the continent to be able to play a significant, or even a leading, role in the world.@@@They usually try to get Africans to subscribe to their narrative and, in the end, Africans are used to support one side against another.@@@When it comes to voting on a draft resolution in the Security Council, we are actively lobbied by both sides.@@@Africa is then greatly in demand, and even put under pressure by some of its partners.@@@Today we believe that such attitudes and actions, which belong to another era, take place in a historical context in which Africa has become aware of its own responsibility and is increasingly speaking with one and the same voice.@@@The divides of the colonial era between a so-called, inter alia, French-, Portuguese-, English- or Arabic-speaking Africa have lessened, as have the post-Cold war ideologies that dominated the second half of the twentieth century.@@@Today Africa wants to be itself.@@@In truth, Africa is Africanophone, if you will allow that neologism.@@@Africa today is no longer the Africa of the 1945s, let alone the 1960s.@@@Today we have a host of new partners in Africa that are an integral part of the new international geopolitics, far removed from the two opposing blocs that shaped the post-war world of the twentieth century.@@@The world has decentred to become multipolar.@@@To paraphrase Blaise Pascal, the world is now a sphere whose centre is both everywhere and nowhere.@@@Africa no longer can, or wants to, be the carriages of a single locomotive.@@@In reality, many African countries no longer feel too bound, in the sense of being tied, by colonial history and are eager to work with new partners.@@@All those changes, linked to history itself, whose essence is perpetual evolution, as well as to the clear desire for a paradigm shift in the level of cooperation in Africa, should lead some Powers to change their approach if they want to continue to work with Africans.@@@There is a need for a change of mentality and behaviour of our partners who come to Africa, each of whom without exception has an agenda dictated primarily by their own interests.@@@Africa expects more equality, respect, equity and justice in its relations and partnerships with the rest of the world and the major Powers, regardless of who they are.@@@Today Africans want to be real partners with the rest of the world.@@@The community of nations must listen to Africa in order to give purpose to our dialogue.@@@Failure to listen distorts the purpose of dialogue, turning it into a juxtaposition of monologues and partial arguments, sometimes under the guise of pseudo-multilateralism, which runs the risk of distorting the relationship.@@@In this world of ours, it is only by collectively pooling our intelligence that we will be able to reach agreement on objectives to achieve collectively.@@@Although the major problems we continue to face are the same, they are perceived in different ways by the North and the South.@@@When it comes to major international issues, listening to African voices means more than just calibrating the discussion.@@@Africa’s megaphone may not be as loud as those of the world’s major Powers, but Africa’s voice counts and must count for those who seek to partner with it on major international issues.@@@Africa is in fact waiting for a real partnership and our allies must make an effort to take on the spirit of such a partnership.@@@Our allies cannot always expect unconditional support from our continent.@@@Africa wants to cooperate with its allies on the basis of its own best interests.@@@To that end, our partners need to abandon fantasies that were largely forged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and are clearly out of step with the twenty-first century, in which national and regional challenges have global implications and global challenges have regional, national and even local manifestations and ramifications.@@@The current international economic repercussions and disruptions directly resulting from the return of war to Europe are a clear example of that.@@@In reality, we are all exposed to the same threats and challenges to our survival and even our existence.@@@However, we deeply believe that we can build a prosperous, more stable and safer world for our peoples through an enhanced and effective multilateralism.@@@Our only option for achieving that is restoring, under the aegis of the United Nations, the strength and determination in our collective capacity for dialogue, resilience and solidarity, which will enable us to make our planet habitable again for all and to sustainably build our shared world together.@@@We should — and I truly mean this — read our founding texts more often and learn to respect and consider the smallest, weakest and the most fragile among us.@@@Yes, we believe that another world is possible.@@@It is inevitable for all of us, because in truth — and here I paraphrase the famous scientist Albert Einstein on the subject of war — I do not know what the Third World War will be like, but I do know that there would not be many people left to see the fourth.@@@I come from one of the three most beautiful countries on Earth.@@@There is an explosion of life there — thousands of multicoloured species in the seas, skies and lands.@@@I come from the land of yellow butterflies and magic.@@@Water cascades down the lush green mountains and valleys — but so do torrents of blood.@@@I come from a country of blood-soaked beauty.@@@My country is both beautiful and violent.@@@How can beauty co-exist with death?@@@How can the biodiversity of life flourish alongside the dance of death and horror?@@@Who is to blame for breaking the spell with terror?@@@Who or what is responsible for burying our daily lives in routine decisions about wealth and interest?@@@Who is leading us to destruction as a nation and a people?@@@My country is beautiful because it has the Amazon forest, the Choco Forest, the waters, the Andes Mountain range and the oceans.@@@There, in those forests, planetary oxygen is generated and atmospheric carbon dioxide (C02) is absorbed.@@@One of those C02-absorbing plants, among millions of species, is one of the most persecuted on Earth.@@@Its destruction is being sought at any cost — it is an Amazonian plant, the coca plant, the sacred plant of the Incas.@@@As if at a paradoxical crossroads, the forest we are trying to save is at the same time being destroyed.@@@To destroy the coca plant, they throw vast quantities of poisons and glyphosate into the water, they arrest the growers and imprison them.@@@People who grow the coca plant are arrested and imprisoned.@@@One million Latin Americans have been killed, and 2 million African- Americans are imprisoned in North America for destroying or possessing the coca leaf.@@@“Destroy the plant that kills”, they shout from the North, but the plant is only one of the millions that perish when they set the jungle on fire.@@@Destroying the forest, the Amazon, has become the watchword of States and businesses.@@@Never mind the scientists’ warning that the rainforest is one of the great pillars of the climate.@@@For the global power networks, the forest and its inhabitants are to blame for the problems that beset them.@@@The global power networks are at the mercy of their addiction to money, remaining in power, oil, cocaine and the hardest drugs available to numb themselves more.@@@There is nothing is more hypocritical than the debate about saving the forest.@@@The forest is burning, while the members of the General Assembly make war and play with it.@@@The forest — the pillar of our global climate — is disappearing with all its life.@@@The great sponge that absorbs planetary C02 is evaporating.@@@This life-saving forest is seen in my country as an enemy to be defeated, a weed to be eradicated.@@@The space where peasants live and grow coca because they have nothing else to grow is being demonized.@@@The members of the General Assembly are interested in my country only if they can throw poison into its forests, put its men into prison and exile its women.@@@They have no interest in our children’s education, they want to destroy our forest and extract coal and oil from its bowels.@@@Our poison-absorbing sponge is of no use, they prefer to spread more poison into the atmosphere.@@@For the members of the General Assembly, we provide an excuse for the emptiness and loneliness of their own societies, which leads them to live in a drug bubble.@@@We hide them from their problems, which they refuse to reform.@@@It is better to declare war on the forests, on its plants, on its people.@@@While they let the forest burn, while hypocrites pursue the plants with poison in order to hide the disasters of their own societies, they ask us for more and more coal, more and more oil in order to satisfy their other addiction — to consumption, to power, to money.@@@Which is more toxic to humankind — cocaine, coal or oil?@@@The judgement of power has decreed that cocaine is a poison and must be persecuted, even if it only causes minimal deaths by overdose — more deaths are caused by contamination of the drug during its illicit trade.@@@Meanwhile, they have declared that coal and oil must be protected, with the result that their use could lead to humankind’s extinction.@@@That is the
state of world power, of injustice and of irrationality, because world power has become irrational.@@@They see in the forest’s exuberance and vitality a lustfulness and sinfulness — the root cause of the sadness in their societies, which are steeped in the insatiable compulsion to have and to consume.@@@How can they hide the loneliness in people’s hearts, the emptiness of societies devoid of affection and competitive to the point of trapping people’s souls in loneliness, if not by blaming the plant, the people who grow it and the liberal secrets of the jungle?@@@According to the irrational world Powers, it is not the market that is to blame for shortening humankind’s existence, but the forest and those who live in it.@@@The bank accounts have become unlimited, the savings of the most powerful people on Earth could not even be spent in centuries.@@@The sadness of existence created by that artificial call for competition is filled with noise and drugs.@@@The addiction to money and possessions has another side to it — addiction to drugs in people who lose the contest, in the artificial race into which they have transformed humankind.@@@The disease of loneliness will not be cured by spreading glyphosate in the forest.@@@It is not the forest that is to blame.@@@Those to blame are the societies trained to engage in endless consumption and into stupidly mistaking consumption for happiness, while filling the pockets of the powerful with money.@@@The forest is not to blame for drug addiction — it is the irrational behaviour of the world Powers.@@@Give them a dose of light, of reason.@@@Turn the century’s lights back on.@@@The war on drugs has lasted 40 years.@@@If we do not change course and it continues for another 40 years, the United States will see 2,800,000 young people die of overdose from fentanyl, a drug that Latin America does not produce.@@@It will see millions of African-Americans incarcerated in private prisons.@@@African-American prisoners will become a business venture for prison companies.@@@One million more Latin Americans will be murdered, our waters and green fields will be filled with blood and the dream of democracy will die, both in my America and in Anglo-Saxon America.@@@Democracy will die where it was born, in the great Athens of the European West.@@@If we hide the truth, we will see the forest and our democracies die.@@@The war on drugs has failed.@@@The fight against the climate crisis has failed.@@@Deadly drug use has increased, progressing from soft drugs to harder drugs.@@@Genocide has been perpetrated on my continent, and in my country millions of people have been sent to prison — and they have blamed the forest and its plants in order to hide their own social guilt.@@@They have filled their speeches and their policies with nonsense.@@@On behalf of my wounded Latin America, I call for an end to the irrational war on drugs.@@@Reducing drug consumption does not require wars or weapons.@@@It requires us all to build better societies — more caring, affectionate societies, in which the intensity of life protects us from addictions and new forms of slavery.@@@Do the members of the General Assembly want fewer drugs?@@@Let them think about less money, more love.@@@Let them think about the rational exercise of power.@@@Let them not taint the beauty of my homeland with their poisons.@@@Let them help us, without hypocrisy, to save the Amazon forest in order to ensure humankind’s existence on the planet.@@@They brought the scientists together, who spoke with reason.@@@Their mathematics and climatological models demonstrated that the end of the human species is near and that we no longer have millenniums — or even centuries — left.@@@Science set the alarm bells ringing, and we stopped listening to them.@@@War has served as an excuse for not taking the necessary measures.@@@When action was most needed, when speeches were no longer useful, when it was indispensable to deposit money into funds to save humankind, when it was necessary to move away as soon as possible from coal and oil — they invented one war after another.@@@They invaded Ukraine, but also Iraq, Libya and Syria.@@@They invaded in the name of oil and gas.@@@In the twenty-first century, they discovered the worst of their addictions: money and oil.@@@Wars have served for them as an excuse to not take action to combat the climate crisis and shown them how dependent they are on what will finish off the human species.@@@When the members of the General Assembly see starving and thirsty people migrating north by the millions, to where the water is, they enclose them, build walls, deploy machine guns and shoot at them.@@@They expel them as if they were not human beings, five times worse than the mentality of those whose policies created the gas chambers and concentration camps.@@@They have brought us back on a global scale to 1933 — the day of the great triumph of the assault on reason.@@@Do they not
see that the solution to the great exodus unleashed on their countries is to bring back the flow of nutrients into the water that fills the rivers and fields?@@@The climate disaster fills us with viruses that spread devastation, but they do business with medicines and turn vaccines into commodities.@@@They say that the market will save us from what the market itself created.@@@Humankind, like Frankenstein, lets the market — and greed — act without planning, abandoning logic and reason.@@@It subordinates human reason to greed.@@@What is the point of war when what we need to do is save the human species?@@@What is the point of NATO and empires when the end of intelligence is near?@@@The climate disaster will kill hundreds of millions of people, and the members of the General Assembly may be assured that it is not the planet but capital that will be to blame.@@@The cause of the climate disaster is capital.@@@The logic of relationships geared to consuming more and more and producing more and more so that some of us earn more and more is the cause of the climate disaster.@@@They harnessed the logic of the expanded accumulation of capital to the use of coal- and petrol- fired engines, and they unleashed a hurricane: the chemical changes in our atmosphere will be more and more widespread and deadly.@@@Now in a parallel word, the expanded accumulation of capital is the expanded accumulation of death.@@@From the land of forests and beauty — where they decided to make the Amazon forest the enemy and to extradite and imprison its farmers — I urge the members of the General Assembly to stop the war and put an end to the climate disaster.@@@Here in the Amazon forest, humankind has failed.@@@Behind the conflagrations burning there, behind the poisoning, lies the failure of humankind as a civilization.@@@Behind the addiction to cocaine and drugs, behind the addiction to oil and coal, lies the real addiction of this current phase of human history: the addiction to irrational power, to profit and to money.@@@That is the massive deadly machinery that could wipe out humankind.@@@As President of one of the most beautiful — and blood-drenched and exploited — countries on Earth, I call for an end to the war on drugs and for our people to be allowed to live in peace.@@@I call on all of Latin America to come together with one voice in order to defeat the irrational behaviour that is making martyrs of our physical bodies.@@@I call on the members of the General Assembly to save the entirety of the Amazon forest using resources that can be allocated worldwide to ensuring life.@@@For those members that do not have the capacity to finance the funding of the revitalization of the forests or for which it is harder to allocate money to life than to weapons, I call on them to reduce foreign debt in order to release our own budget spaces, through which the work of saving humankind and life on the planet can be undertaken.@@@We can do it if they do not want to.@@@Just exchange debt for life, for nature.@@@I call on all members of the General Assembly, and in particular I call on all Latin America, to engage in dialogue to end the war.@@@Do not pressure us to take a side in the war.@@@It is time for peace.@@@Let the Slavic peoples talk to each other.@@@Let the peoples of the world talk to each other.@@@War is only a trap that brings us all closer to the end of time in our great orgy of irrationality.@@@On behalf of Latin America, we call on Ukraine and Russia to make peace.@@@Only in peace can we save lives on this Earth of ours.@@@There can be no total peace without social, economic and environmental justice.@@@We are also at war with the planet.@@@If there is no peace with the planet, there will be no peace among nations.@@@And without social justice, there is no social peace.@@@We are living in unprecedented times with many challenges — war and insecurity, energy and food crises, climate change and the lingering consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@And that list of challenges is far from complete.@@@The abrupt increase in security risks and the tectonic instabilities that have occurred since the previous session’s general debate are threatening to destroy the rules-based world order — the order that has been built here in this Hall by all of us, by sovereign States and the peoples of the world.@@@That is why a great majority of the speakers during this year’s debate believe our biggest security risk to be the war that the Russian Federation is waging against its neighbour, breaking basic international rules and violating the Charter of the United Nations itself.@@@This illegal military aggression by a permanent member of the Security Council is not only undermining global security but also putting the international rules-based order in jeopardy.@@@Bulgaria is deeply concerned about the recent escalation of the conflict and the partial mobilization announced by the Russian Federation.@@@We reject the ongoing sham referendums in occupied Ukraine and consider them neither free nor fair and with no binding force.@@@In those unfortunate circumstances, each and every contribution towards achieving more stability and cooperation among States in different regions must be encouraged and welcomed.@@@As a South-East European country, Bulgaria attaches the utmost importance to peace, stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans region.@@@We are confident that the transformative power of the European Union integration process and inclusive regional cooperation are both the most powerful tools for achieving a common space of democratic governance, a market economy and political, economic and social sustainability.@@@We will continue to support such countries on their path to the European Union.@@@Bulgaria is concerned by the lack of progress in the efforts to advance the Middle East peace process, as well as the recent escalation of tensions in the Gaza Strip.@@@Enhanced cooperation between international and regional partners is needed to provide a political horizon for the resumption of bilateral Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.@@@A negotiated and viable two-State solution that allows both Palestinians and Israelis to live side by side in peace, within secure and recognized borders, is essential to the stability of the entire Middle East.@@@Bulgaria is following with concern the critical developments in Afghanistan, including the human rights situation and the restrictions imposed by the
Taliban on the rights of women, girls’ access to education and journalists.@@@The war in Europe has global repercussions.@@@The Russian aggression against Ukraine has caused food insecurity and an energy crisis, which have devastating socioeconomic impacts on countries worldwide.@@@Even before, the global food system was already under pressure due to factors such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@However, the crisis has escalated dramatically because of the war, as disruptions in food, energy and financial systems in more than 90 countries around the world have put 1.7 billion people at risk.@@@Bulgaria highly appreciates the United Nations- and Tiirkiye-mediated deal on the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, and we fully share the assessment that that very welcome development has the potential to significantly alleviate the current food crisis.@@@Nevertheless, the situation remains critical, and the need for humanitarian assistance to a number of countries in the global South persists.@@@Some two and a half years ago, we were faced with the first lethal pandemic of the twenty-first century, which changed our lifestyles, the way of doing business and, above all, the way in which we communicate with each other.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic also triggered a revolution in human online activities and interaction through various digital communication platforms.@@@It also caused huge quakes in both societies and economies, deepened the gap between the rich and the poor, applying both to people as well as to entire nations, and wiped out at least a decade of progress made in reaching the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Our planet is visibly suffering from the devastating effects of climate change: deforestation, desertification, weather extremes, environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity, affecting in one way or another each and every one of us, no matter where we live.@@@Action is urgently needed.@@@We are deeply concerned about the humanitarian and food crises in Africa, especially in the Sahel and Lake Chad regions, which are further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.@@@They are an additional burden on post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.@@@In that context, specific and comprehensive responses that address the short-term needs of the countries concerned, as well as strengthening their resilience and sustainability, are needed.@@@We therefore commend the efforts of both the United Nations and the African Union to address those challenges.@@@Dialogue and cooperation with the countries of the Indo-Pacific region are becoming particularly important.@@@Bulgaria supports the strengthening of partnerships with like-minded countries from the region in energy connectivity, digitalization, people-to-people contacts, security of supplies, security and defence, countering disinformation, et cetera.@@@As the country currently holding the presidency of the Economic and Social Council, we attach great importance to the priorities of emerging economies with regard to sustainable development, as well as to the priorities of small island States, taking into account their specific needs, including their existential struggle over the impact of global warming and the constant sea-level rise.@@@I would now like to share another very important and pressing issue.@@@The world finds itself at a watershed moment for human rights, as it faces numerous challenges in that regard.@@@Neither peace nor prosperity can be meaningful concepts without full respect for human rights and human dignity.@@@We are a staunch supporter of the universality and indivisibility of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.@@@As an active member of the Human Rights Council between 2019 and 2021, Bulgaria firmly promoted the rights of the child, women and girls, as well as their empowerment.@@@Gender equality and the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities are also key priorities for my country.@@@Strongly committed to further advancing the human rights agenda worldwide, Bulgaria has presented its candidature for membership of the Human Rights Council for the period from 2024 to 2026.@@@Education is a basic human right, with the transformative power to foster a fairer and more inclusive world.@@@Education is a solid foundation for future peace, tolerance and sustainable development.@@@Over the past couple of years, the COVID-19 pandemic further limited the access of children to education in the developing world.@@@That motivated my country to play an active role in the preparation of the Transforming Education Summit, and we are encouraged by the successful outcome of that event.@@@Let me now briefly turn to United Nations reform in three closely interrelated areas: governance, peace and security and sustainable development.@@@We cannot be complacent about the pace of reform so far, and we
must seize the historic wave of opportunity to make strides in the process.@@@Bulgaria therefore supports the acceleration of the reform efforts, in line with the proposals in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), aimed at reaching a new global consensus on our future and stepping up multilateral cooperation to achieve it.@@@We support the comprehensive reform of the Security Council.@@@We have reached a critical juncture where it is untenable to maintain the status quo.@@@The current situation where that highest organ of the Organization is failing to play its key role under the Charter of the United Nations cannot be tolerated by the international community.@@@That is a duty that we owe to the future generations.@@@Allocating at least one additional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European States in a reformed Security Council remains a priority for my country.@@@During the seventy-seventh session, Bulgaria will remain strongly committed to its financial obligations to the United Nations and is concerned about the persisting liquidity challenges, which undermine the ability of the Organization to implement its mandates and carry out its approved programme of work.@@@We will continue to support the Secretary-General’s policies to improve the financial situation of the United Nations.@@@Bulgaria consistently ranks among the Member States that have contributed on time and in full to both the United Nations regular and peacekeeping budgets.@@@Allow me to conclude by sharing with the Assembly our vision of the way ahead.@@@We will have to navigate uncharted waters.@@@If we build upon the consolidated and unanimous approach of upholding the principles and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, we may exit the present crisis, but we will have a long way to go to re-establish security and economic stability after the war.@@@The world of tomorrow will be very different from what we expected it to be not too long ago.@@@Whether or not we will be up to the challenge will depend on our unity and ability to act together, as one, to mitigate negative side effects, readjust our lives to the new realities in the world and shore up rules-based multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.@@@We come to this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly in moments of extreme vulnerability and danger, which have put and continue to put life in all its aspects at risk, in a world where we should unite to continue facing the great social, economic, climatic, cultural and security challenges to which the human family is exposed on a daily basis.@@@We come to speak on behalf of a heroic, dignified, sovereign, free people who, together with so many other heroic, dignified, sovereign and free peoples of the planet, have been demonstrating and exercising our national dignity and sovereignty, faced over centuries with the avarice and colonial and imperial greed that have raged, from Europe and the north of this wounded continent, attacking, intervening in, invading and occupying our sacred lands.@@@The invaders have been expelled from Nicaragua and defeated by the bravery of Nicaraguan patriotism.@@@Our own courage has also been inspired by the great revolutionary and evolutionary liberation struggles of the admirable peoples of this world.@@@In these times of brazen and violent greedy, ambitious, avaricious practices, of absurd political pretence, and their notorious, spiteful media farces, as they seek to seize our freedoms, our natural and cultural heritage, so as to impose — although they will not succeed in doing so — a global society governed and administered by those who have committed and flaunted their criminality with horrifying and stunning shamelessness amid the most tremendous looting of the riches of our common home.@@@The assault, the robbery, the disgraceful, abominable depredation, the looting and the genocides unleashed by the colonialists and imperialists of the Earth are real crimes, and their perpetrators are the true criminals against humanity.@@@We denounce them in those terms.@@@In speaking on this final day of the general debate of the seventy-seventh session, we do so with our heads held high and our hearts full of freedom- loving, fraternal solidarity, espousing lasting justice and peace, and sovereignty and independence that must be respected, as well as the character — a great deal of character, a great deal of mettle, a great deal of heart — to defend what is ours.@@@We speak the language of a human community that demands recognition of our particularities, our models and ways of life, our creeds and beliefs, in accordance with our own history, tradition and aspirations, which we must make victorious, because life is made up of effort, anxieties, searching and demands, of respect from each to all, and from all to everyone.@@@It is time to do more to make a reality the right of the peoples to a United Nations that represents us all and does not submit to the designs of any imperialist Power.@@@It is time to assert a world of dialogue and peace, of justice and solidarity, of brotherhood and sisterhood and genuine, true goodwill, coming together despite our differences and enriching our consensus.@@@It is time to assert our multiple voices, our demands, our causes, which can no longer be ignored or buried under piles and mountains of idolatry and indifference.@@@It is time to transcend the selfishness that kills millions of human beings through the world, subjecting them to the cruelty of poverty and extreme poverty out of the barbaric, animal-like instincts of the great Powers, which seek to sustain and even perpetuate their domination at the cost of hunger, ill health, climatic destruction, ignorance, war and all the darkness derived from hatred.@@@It is time to continue rejecting criminal blockades, all the illegal, arbitrary, illicit aggressions called sanctions, which highlight the prevailing perversion of an imperialist and capitalist system and model that seeks to continue imposing punishments, bleeding the world dry, in full view and with the patient complacency of the organisms that should defend it.@@@It is time to say, “enough” to the lack of common sense, compassion and spirituality, to the appalling and utter disregard of the human condition and soul.@@@It is time to say “enough is enough”, to rebel and continue to rebel against the innate evil of capitalism, which suffocates the majority while brutally enriching the few.@@@Enough is enough.@@@It is time to say “enough” to the hypocritical imperialism that politicizes, falsifies and denigrates the very human rights that they themselves violate and deny on a daily basis, imperialism and its coercive actions against life in all its spheres, which are contrary to international law in and of themselves.@@@It is time to stop, with the help of everyone, the invasions, aggressions and occupations affecting so many territories made for the glory of God, in the name of the right to a safe, harmonious life, with rights, with decent work, with food and sustainable and viable means to be able to affirm the well-being and happiness that we deserve.@@@It is time to denounce and put an end to the capital sins used to justify intervention and interference in the internal domestic affairs of each country.@@@And it is time to assert the freedom to be ourselves and not what others — who demand, who wage war, seeking to displace us and continue to occupy us so as to plunder our cultural and natural riches — want us to be.@@@It is time to enforce the principle of the sovereign equality of States in all international organizations and forums, so that this multipolar, non-aligned world that we have worked so hard to bring about becomes a reality, strengthens and grows while taking all of us into account.@@@It is time to ensure that the Charter of the United Nations and so many organizations that should serve to bring us together are valid for everyone and respect the rights of everyone.@@@Now is and should be the time of the peoples.@@@All our countries that have lived through all the fires of greed, avarice, selfishness, the vainglory of vanities and the search for absolute dominion by others over a world that does not belong to them must strengthen and consolidate our identities and consensus, together defending culture and justice based on respect and peace in all relevant spaces.@@@We support and embrace with commitment dignified and brave Venezuela, with heroic Cuba, with the historic and noble battles of the Palestinian people, with the Islamic revolution of the Iranian families; the continuing great battle of the Russian Federation against fascism and for security, integrity and peace, which will continue, we have no doubt, to gather victories.@@@We embrace with solidarity the admirable resistance and just development of the People’s Republic of China, which generates so much discomfort, concern and envy among the enemies of the common good.@@@It is time to remain united with Syria, with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, with Belarus, with the peoples of Asia, of Africa, of our America and the Caribbean, fighting all the magnificent, momentous struggles that we are sure will result in the most sublime and supreme triumph of all time — a new world that is now indispensable and cannot be postponed!@@@In Nicaragua, there is a patriotic nation, and because there is a patriotic nation, there is peace.@@@In the name of our generals of free men and women, Augusto Sandino and Benjamin Zeledon, national heroes, heroes of anti-imperialism who fill our hearts with the resolve to fight and continue to overcome; in the name of our infinite father of metaphor, dreams and realities both worldly and heavenly, our magical teacher, the great Ruben Dario, we greet each and everyone here and call on us all to continue fighting for justice, peace and the inalienable rights of our peoples, life, health, strength, hope and faith in the future.@@@A better world, multipolar, just, ethical, spiritually and materially, is already being born, and we are here to continue its creation and to defend it.@@@The sovereignty of a people is not a matter for discussion, but to be defended, with love and the sacred flames of celestial hopes.@@@We meet today, in this General Assembly, as the alarm bells ring all around us.@@@Numerous crises batter our world, crises that are increasingly interlocked — regional conflicts with an international impact, devastating climate change, pandemic disruptions, extremist violence, spiralling inflation, looming recession and, for all too many around the world, the growing reality of hunger.@@@Developing countries have been the hardest hit.@@@Is this the future that we will leave to the generations yet to come?@@@We must deliver a different world, one of expanded horizons, a more equitable world, sustainable economic growth, exciting new opportunities, more and better jobs and the inclusive peace for prosperity, in which all people can thrive.@@@To reach those goals, our countries must unite behind effective collaborative action.@@@The question now is whether we will have the vision and determination to get the job done.@@@Let us consider the climate crisis.@@@No country can heal our injured Earth alone.@@@We need global partnerships that can create real change.@@@Jordan is part of those efforts.@@@We have been building strong partnerships to manage and sustain vital water resources, and we see more opportunities to work with partners to preserve precious world heritage sites and natural wonders — the unique Dead Sea, the sacred Jordan River and the resilient coral reefs of the Gulf of Aqaba, all of which are threatened by climate change.@@@Food security is another global priority.@@@Hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry, and the numbers are rising.@@@How can parents raise healthy children?@@@How can students learn?@@@How can workers do their best when they are hungry and without hope?@@@Since the beginning of the pandemic, and now with the crisis in Ukraine, global supply chains have been disrupted.@@@Many well-off countries experienced empty food shelves for the first time in living memory.@@@They are discovering a truth that people in developing countries have known for a long time — for countries to thrive, affordable food must reach every family’s table.@@@At the global level, that demands collective measures to ensure fair access to affordable food and expedite the movement of staples to countries in need.@@@Sustainable, inclusive economic growth has too often been a victim of global crises, but it can also be a defence that strengthens us to endure the storms.@@@In my region, we expect to build integrated partnerships that tap the capabilities and resources of each of our countries for the benefit of all.@@@We see regional resilience packs coming together to stimulate fresh opportunities and growth.@@@Jordan has established multilateral partnerships with
Egypt, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other countries in the region to capitalize on those opportunities.@@@Our country is a bridge for regional partnerships and cooperation, international crisis response and humanitarian action.@@@Jordan has always been a source of regional stability, as well as a refuge for those in need.@@@In that context, let me say a word about refugees and the communities that host them.@@@In 2012, I stood before the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and spoke for the first time about the Syrian refugee flow and its pressure on Jordan’s scarce resources (see A/61/ PV.7).@@@At that point, 200,000 Syrians had sought refuge in our small country.@@@Today, 10 years later, we host more than 1.3 million.@@@Meeting the needs of those and other refugees is an international responsibility, and host countries look to the international community to honour its commitments.@@@For decades, the Middle East has been synonymous with conflict and crisis.@@@But we are hopeful that a new-found spirit of collaboration can make our region an exemplar of resilience and integration.@@@While politics may sometimes fail our world, one absolute remains — always put people first.@@@To keep hope alive for all peoples means rising above politics to ensure every individual’s prosperity.@@@Such efforts will be fruitless if they are exclusionary.@@@Inclusion of the Palestinian people in regional economic projects should be an integral part of our efforts.@@@In the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, peace continues to be elusive.@@@Neither war nor diplomacy has held the answer to that historic tragedy.@@@It is the people themselves, not politics and politicians, who will have to come together and push their leaders to resolve it.@@@What would our world look like now if the conflict had been settled long ago, if walls had never gone up and if people had been allowed to build bridges of cooperation instead?@@@What if extremists had never been able to exploit the injustices of occupation?@@@How many generations of young people could have grown up in the optimism of peace and progress?@@@As we continue our efforts to achieve peace, we must not abandon refugees.@@@This year, the General Assembly will vote on renewing the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.@@@The international community should send a strong message of support for the rights of Palestinian refugees, ensuring that Palestinian refugee
 children have schools to go to and access to appropriate medical care.@@@A founding principle of the United Nations is the right to self-determination for all peoples.@@@The Palestinian people, with their resilient national identity, cannot be denied that right.@@@The road forward is the two-State solution, in accordance with United Nations resolutions — a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian State based on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with Israel in peace, security and prosperity.@@@Today the future of Jerusalem is an urgent concern.@@@The city is holy to billions of Muslims, Christians and Jews around the world.@@@Undermining Jerusalem’s legal and historical status quo triggers global tensions and deepens religious divides.@@@The holy city must not be a place for hatred and division.@@@As custodians of Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian holy sites, we are committed to protecting their historical and legal status quo and to their safety and future.@@@As a Muslim leader, let me clearly say that we are committed to defending the rights, the precious heritage and the historic identity of the Christian people of our region.@@@Nowhere is that more important than in Jerusalem.@@@Today Christianity in the holy city is under fire.@@@The rights of churches in Jerusalem are threatened.@@@That cannot continue.@@@Christianity is vital to the past and present of our region and the holy land.@@@It must remain an integral part of our future.@@@We can weather the most serious crises if we join together.@@@Let us here in this General Assembly honour our shared interest in a brighter future, a future of dignity and hope, that brings new opportunities for all our peoples.@@@But let us not ignore the alarm bells ringing around us.@@@We must act.@@@I am honoured to address this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia.@@@Let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at this seventy-seventh session and assure him of Liberia’s fullest support.@@@I would also like to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for a job well done in administering the affairs of the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly.@@@Let me also extend my profound thanks and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his remarkable and visionary leadership.@@@This year’s Assembly is taking place at a difficult time when, even as the world is recovering from the scourge of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we continue to face the challenges of the war in Ukraine, climate change and its devastating effects on our environment.@@@Just as the Ukrainian people are enduring the harsh impact of this unwarranted military incursion, the rest of the world is feeling the harsh consequences of economic downturn caused by disruptions in global supply chains, food insecurity and the rising prices of basic goods and services.@@@The theme of this year’s Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is both appropriate and meaningful.@@@It not only reminds us of the current state of our world, but provides us the space to reflect on the multiple challenges that confront us today.@@@They include the health and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the devastating effects of climate change, environmental concerns, poverty reduction, food insecurity and gender inequality.@@@The challenges confronting the world today will require immediate collective global actions, with the United Nations at the centre of the search for solutions.@@@In so doing, we must give special consideration to the needs of developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, in line with the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031.@@@Working together with the United Nations family, Liberia hereby commits to protecting our planet, promoting peace, preventing conflicts, ensuring sustainable financing and boosting partnerships.@@@That commitment is reflected in the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, which embodies the expression of our shared determination to achieve peace, prosperity and national development and to address extreme poverty, inequalities, regional disparities, infrastructure deficits, climate change and equitable distribution of our national wealth.@@@Given Liberia’s youthful population of more than 60 per cent, my Government initiated a youth rehabilitation and empowerment programme, the Socioeconomic Empowerment of Disadvantaged Youth Project, between 2019 and 2021, with the subsequent launch of a $13-million national fund drive for the rehabilitation and empowerment of at-risk youth in Liberia.@@@We remain of the firm conviction that, when empowered, our youth can be a positive force for good.@@@As Liberia’s feminist-in-chief, women’s empowerment and the promotion of gender equality remain key priorities of my Government.@@@Women not only comprise almost half of our country’s population; they also play important roles at all levels of our society and must be given deserved equal attention, support and a place at the leadership and governance tables in our society.@@@To that end, we have developed a legal framework, including the ratification of regional and international instruments to address gender inequalities, which arise as a result of sociocultural perceptions, practices and stereotypes that support male dominance and the subordination of women.@@@I would like to inform the Assembly that my Government, together with United Nations partners, is implementing the European Union Spotlight Initiative to end violence and harmful traditional practices against women and girls and promote their sexual and reproductive health and rights.@@@Furthermore, the Government of Liberia is currently implementing a $50-million project funded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to enhance the capacity of female entrepreneurs.@@@I would like to express Liberia’s sincere gratitude to our local and international partners, both multilateral and bilateral, for their continued support of our national efforts in combating the pandemic.@@@As a result of that support, Liberia is well on its way to achieving herd immunity, hopefully by the end of this year, with 67 per cent of the population already fully vaccinated.@@@My Government continues to take actions through the formulation of new policy frameworks and strategic interventions to address the impacts of climate change and protect the environment.@@@Liberia is committed to achieving the target of a 64-per cent reduction in carbon emissions below business as usual by 2030.@@@We anticipate that the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt, will provide the opportunity to accelerate work towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Sustainable development can take place only in a peaceful and secure environment.@@@In the fulfilment of our commitment to the maintenance of regional and global peace and security, Liberia takes pride as a troop-contributing country, with Liberian troops and other security apparatuses serving in the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei.@@@We thank the United Nations and our bilateral and multilateral partners for the support that we continue to receive in facilitating our contribution to global and regional peace and security.@@@I am pleased to report that the International Monetary Fund’s latest appraisal of its ongoing programme with Liberia is very positive.@@@It shows that inflation rates have been significantly reduced.@@@There are now better prospects for economic growth compared to previous years, despite the negative effects COVID-19.@@@Our efforts in instituting new policy measures to fight graft are also particularly commended in the report, along with our adherence to prudent fiscal management.@@@Democracy in Liberia also continues to grow from strength to strength.@@@After many years of civil upheaval, Liberia is becoming a stronghold of peace and a safe haven for democracy.@@@That is because we have taken actions in the past few years to build and strengthen democratic institutions, such as the press and the Liberian judiciary.@@@We have put forward new legislation that empowers the media, while eradicating laws that have tended to suppress free speech.@@@I am proud to say that, from the beginning of my Administration to date, there have been no political prisoners in Liberia.@@@At the regional conferences of the Mano River Union and ECOWAS, which have been convened to discuss efforts to restore democracy in a few trouble spots in our West African region, Liberia has constantly and consistently pleaded for strict adherence to constitutional term limits and a return to democratic civilian rule in cases of military takeovers.@@@Liberia is expected to hold presidential and legislative elections in October 2023.@@@The upcoming elections will be crucial to consolidating our democracy.@@@In that regard, I underscore my Government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring that the enabling environment will continue to exist for the holding of peaceful, free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections.@@@That is in keeping with my commitment to ensuring that the democratic will of the Liberian people is respected at all times.@@@In the run-up to the 2023 elections, it is incumbent upon all prospective candidates to avoid the incitement of violence and any other behaviour that could deprive the Liberian people of the peaceful space that they need to freely exercise their franchise and express their political will in choosing their leaders.@@@We must let the people decide, and then we must respect their decision.@@@That is indeed the true essence of democracy.@@@If we are to advance the common good of humankind, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, then international cooperation must be given primacy and the principle of solidarity must have its rightful place.@@@We have the platform to generate the transformative solutions that we seek.@@@The world is watching.@@@Our people are watching.@@@We must now seize the moment, confront the challenges and collectively endeavour to lift the poor from poverty, hunger, sickness and disease and ensure progress, development and prosperity for all.@@@At the same time, we must protect our planet and guarantee and maintain global peace, security and stability.@@@We must pursue efforts to make the United Nations more efficient, more effective, more inclusive, more accountable and more suited to its purpose.@@@On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, let me first convey my warmest greetings to the President and the members of the General Assembly.@@@It is indeed very humbling to stand here today to address the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session as sovereign equals.@@@I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I assure him of Solomon Islands’ support and cooperation during his tenure in office.@@@I also commend and thank his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his assertive leadership of the Assembly during an unprecedented period in our history.@@@Solomon Islands is a member of the family of Commonwealth countries and a realm State; therefore, on behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, I express our profound grief over the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and convey our heartfelt and deepest condolences to His Royal Highness, King Charles III, the royal family and the Government and people of the United Kingdom.@@@Her Majesty will always be remembered as an inspiration and a figure of stability, dignity and grace.@@@May God bless the reign of King Charles III as Head of the Commonwealth and all realm countries.@@@The shifting international system has generated renewed strategic interests in the corner of the world that we regard as our home — the Pacific — with superpowers and middle Powers coming together seeking to strengthen their presence in the blue Pacific continent.@@@Solomon Islands sees the global system as interlinked and interdependent.@@@The recently adopted 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, approved by Pacific leaders and launched here in New York yesterday, defines the Pacific region’s priorities and strategic interests.@@@The Strategy offers opportunities that can be leveraged to benefit our people.@@@The large ocean island States that inhabit the blue Pacific continent share a common sense of identity and purpose.@@@All partners that wish to work with Pacific countries must align with that strategy.@@@The right to establish diplomatic relations between sovereign nations is a universal principle shared by all members of the United Nations.@@@Solomon Islands has been unfairly targeted since it formalized diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China just over three years ago.@@@We have been subjected to a barrage of unwarranted and misplaced criticisms, misinformation and intimidation that threaten our democracy and sovereignty.@@@Solomon Islands has been vilified in the media since formalizing its relationship with China.@@@That decision was reached through democratic processes by a democratically elected Government.@@@Our decision to establish a relationship with the People’s Republic of China is consistent with resolution 2758 (XXVI), observed by most of the countries in the Assembly, and which also articulates the One China policy that Solomon Islands respects.@@@I reiterate the call for all to respect our sovereignty and democracy.@@@Solomon Islands has adopted a “friends to all and enemies to none” foreign policy.@@@In implementing that policy, we will not align ourselves with any external Powers or security architecture that targets our or any other sovereign country or threatens regional and international peace.@@@Solomon Islands will not be coerced into choosing sides.@@@I am reminded of the wisdom conveyed by the late President Nelson Mandela during an interview with Ted Koppel, which is relevant to our situation:
“One of the mistakes which some political analysts make is to think their enemies should be our enemies.@@@Our attitude towards any country is determined by the attitude of that country to our struggle.”@@@Solomon Islands has no enemies — only friends.@@@Our struggle is to develop our country.@@@We stretch out our hand of friendship and seek genuine and honest cooperation and partnership with all.@@@Mutual respect for the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of any country is universal and paramount.@@@As a sovereign nation, we embrace and zealously guard those principles.@@@Looking at the wider region, the Taiwan Strait is one of the world’s busiest trading routes used by international shipping.@@@We call on all countries to be
sensitive and not inflame tensions that could threaten the unity and security of any country.@@@Any miscalculation could threaten international peace and security and have disastrous consequences on global trade.@@@Regarding the Ukraine conflict, Solomon Islands calls for maximum restraint by all the parties and a de-escalation of the conflict.@@@We continue to hear words of war in this Hall of peace.@@@We must be united in our resolve to seek peace and urge all parties to pursue a diplomatic solution to the conflict, based on the spirit and purpose of our Charter of the United Nations.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, climate change, the impact of global conflicts and domestic civil unrest have jeopardized our progress on delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@They have undermined our ability to graduate out of least developed country (LDC) status in 2024.@@@Solomon Islands has experienced negative economic growth owing to the closure of our international borders since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic more than two years ago.@@@Those circumstances have changed the landscape for our progress and sustainable development.@@@We will collaborate with partners to undertake an in-depth assessment of our readiness to graduate out of LDC status in 2024.@@@Solomon Islands joins other countries in the blue Pacific continent that are signatories of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty for maintaining a nuclear-free Pacific.@@@We encourage nuclear-power States that have signed the Treaty to take the steps to ratify it.@@@The Treaty is aligned with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@We reiterate our call for the total elimination of nuclear material, nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered military assets in our blue Pacific.@@@Solomon Islands also echoes the concerns expressed by other Pacific countries about Japan’s proposal to discharge water treated by the advanced liquid processing system at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean, because of the potential transboundary and intergenerational implications.@@@I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that Solomon Islands has now legally formalized the delimitation of all five of its maritime boundaries with Australia, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, France and Fiji.@@@With the completion of all five maritime boundaries, our rights and obligations are protected under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in perpetuity.@@@In that connection, the Solomon Islands Government supports the ongoing work undertaken by the International Law Commission on the question of sea level rise and sovereignty.@@@The position taken by Solomon Islands is that once the signed instruments are deposited with the United Nations, our boundaries have achieved permanent status.@@@That also upholds the principles of stability, security, certainty and perpetuity enshrined in UNCLOS.@@@Solomon Islands is a post-conflict country and our work to address the underlying causes of that conflict is still a work in progress.@@@Sadly, in November 2021, that progress was seriously hampered by civil unrest and rioting that exposed the country’s security and economic fragility.@@@We welcome any assistance in addressing our post-conflict challenges.@@@On a brighter note, Solomon Islands will, for the first time, be hosting the Pacific Games in 2023.@@@The event will strengthen the unity of our nation and will contribute to our nation-building and peacebuilding processes.@@@I take this opportunity to thank our partners who have assisted us thus far in our preparation to host the Games, including the People’s Republic of China, which funds the bulk of the Games’ facilities; the Republic of Indonesia; Australia; Papua New Guinea; and Japan.@@@The 2023 Pacific Games infrastructure has transformed our capital city and has opened new opportunities for our youthful population.@@@Solomon Islands has embarked on a digital transformation journey to enhance and modernize our telecommunications infrastructure, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 9, to link its more than 900 inhabited islands distributed over 1.2 million square kilometres of water.@@@Together with Australia and Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands commissioned its first submarine cable in 2019.@@@The geographical reach of the submarine cable will be expanded with the installation of approximately 170 telecommunications towers under a Belt and Road Initiative that will link 80 per cent of Solomon Islands and provide our rural populace with much-needed access to reliable, accessible and affordable telecommunications services.@@@We also acknowledge with appreciation the ongoing support from our bilateral and multilateral partners, including Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, the Green Climate Fund and others, for our infrastructure projects by building new roads, bridges, airports, wharves and hydropower dams.@@@I stand here in solidarity with my Pacific island brothers and sisters to continue our fight against climate change.@@@The onset of extreme temperatures, heatwaves, droughts, flooding and sea-level rise has increased the vulnerability of Pacific countries to the negative impacts of climate change.@@@For least developed countries like Solomon Islands, vulnerability is a key hindrance to sustainable development.@@@Currently, indicators to measure vulnerability are inadequate.@@@Solomon Islands therefore calls on all States and partners to support the development of the multidimensional vulnerability index and looks forward to its finalization and adoption.@@@Pacific Island countries, including Solomon Islands, are in a constant mode of recovery from disasters.@@@Global financial mechanisms for disaster recovery need to be established to ensure the economic burden of recovery and building back better and stronger following rapid onset and climate-related disasters are not borne solely by countries that are in serious need of support.@@@Considering those challenges, the Pacific region has declared a state of climate emergency.@@@Sadly, we are seeing more resources spent on wars than on combating climate change.@@@This is extremely unfortunate.@@@Pacific countries have also established a Pacific Resilience Facility — a financing mechanism that aims to build the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of Pacific populations to the negative impacts of climate change.@@@A pledging session for the Facility will be held during the current session, and we call on all partners to support the Facility.@@@Solomon Islands also commends the Vanuatu-led initiative requesting support from the United Nations to ask the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on climate change, which has also been strongly supported by Pacific leaders.@@@As the world continues to combat climate change, we ask all parties going into the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27) to set more ambitious nationally determined contributions that would put our world on the pathway to 1.5°C.@@@We would also like to see a road map for ease of access to and timely disbursements of the $100 billion earmarked for adaptation financing by 2025.@@@The discussions on loss and damage demand a standalone agenda at COP 27 aimed at establishing a loss and damage financing facility.@@@Solomon Islands embraces the promotion and respect for human rights as a fundamental freedom for all.@@@We subscribe to resolution 60/251 in that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that all human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis.@@@Now, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Solomon Islands has successfully deposited its instrument of ratification to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.@@@We will be submitting our instrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict within the coming weeks.@@@We join the international community in reiterating the call for the lifting of the economic embargo imposed on Cuba.@@@We commend Cuba’s resilience and urge the United States of America to take the initiative and normalize relations between those two close neighbours.@@@I also wish to convey my deepest appreciation to Cuba for the training of our medical students.@@@More than 100 Solomon Islands medical doctors have graduated from Cuban medical schools over the years.@@@Solomon Islands also closely follows the outcome of the third referendum in New Caledonia, which took place in December 2021 in an atmosphere of uncertainty.@@@Solomon Islands subscribes to the contents of the draft resolution contained in document A/AC.109/2022/L.22 and supports the call to all relevant parties to ensure that the next steps for the self-determination process are transparent and inclusive.@@@In relation to our successful fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we express our heartfelt gratitude to our partners, including Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, the United States of America, United Nations agencies, the World Bank and other multilateral agencies that stood with us.@@@They provided us with tremendous support and much-needed vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, as well as bilaterally.@@@Solomon Islands is also extremely grateful for the employment opportunities provided by Australia and New Zealand through their respective labour mobility programmes to accommodate some of the 20,000 unemployed youth who enter our labour market every year.@@@Let me conclude by once again thanking the President of the General Assembly for the theme for this year’s session.@@@Our world is at a crossroads and is feeling the strain of divisive elements that can divide us.@@@We must not allow that to happen.@@@We have been weighed down by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@We are feeling the negative impacts of geopolitical conflicts and wars.@@@The time has come for our world to rally and focus on what unites us, rather than what divides us, for the world will always be stronger if we are together.@@@We must foster friendship and solidarity through genuine and durable partnerships.@@@We must commit to working together, with one other, to ensure we can leave behind a legacy of a more peaceful, more just and brighter world for the younger generations that will come after us.@@@The key questions we must all ask ourselves are the following.@@@First, what legacy do we, as leaders today, leave behind for those that will come after us?@@@Secondly, how do we wish to be remembered by the generations that will follow?@@@I am sure that we would all wish to be remembered as the generation of leaders that uplifted our world and united our people and our countries to live together in peaceful coexistence.@@@If we can leave behind a legacy that safeguards the survival and freedom of our future generations, we will have done our jobs well.@@@It is my great honour and privilege to speak for the first time as the President of the Republic of Vanuatu in this important body, the United Nations General Assembly.@@@Let me start by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I assure him that during his term of office, my delegation will work closely with him to implement the agendas he has set out for this session.@@@The President’s vision for the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session is fitting for addressing the myriad of global issues that confront us today.@@@I would also like to extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his stellar leadership as the General Assembly’s President of Hope at its seventy-sixth session, during an unprecedented and tumultuous year.@@@His inspiring work for humankind has left a strong impression at the United Nations and around the world.@@@Today the world is facing a profusion of mounting challenges, many of which are inextricably linked.@@@We are slowly recovering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, but recovery is becoming ever more difficult with rising debt levels and looming inflation caused by supply-chain disruptions and the increase in fuel and food prices as a result of the Russia- Ukraine crisis.@@@Those challenges pose a major risk of global recession and add to the rising humanitarian crisis that we are already facing.@@@As we gather here, more families around the world are finding it extremely difficult to put food on the table, pay their bills and rent and meet other basic expenses.@@@Such hardships can be avoided by deploying smarter diplomacy and appropriate macroeconomic policies.@@@Those challenges are compounded by an existential climate crisis that is already devastating our economies and ecosystems.@@@In the past few years we have witnessed record heat, wildfires, severe hurricanes, coral bleaching, rising sea levels, prolonged droughts and record flooding.@@@The global challenges that we are facing have the greatest impact on the poor and vulnerable.@@@Without basic social safety nets and fundamental human rights protections, their future is uncertain.@@@We are experiencing the debilitating consequences of the climate crisis every day, and the world is now demanding more ambitious action on climate at every level.@@@That emergency, one of our own making, is now affecting everyone, from the poorest nations to the richest.@@@No one is immune to the extreme weather events ravaging our islands, cities and States.@@@No one can escape the rising tides.@@@Our young people are terrified of the future world we are handing to them through expanded fossil-fuel dependency, and we are compromising intergenerational trust and equity.@@@Fundamental human rights are being violated, as we begin measuring climate change not in degrees Celsius or tons of carbon but in human lives.@@@The time is up.@@@Action is required now.@@@And that is why the nations of the blue Pacific continent are leading a global initiative to bring climate change to the International Court of Justice, the only principal organ of the United Nations that has not yet been given an opportunity to weigh in on the climate crisis.@@@We believe that bringing climate change to the Court is a global public good that will further support the progressive development of international law.@@@In this very Hall, working in solidarity with Member States, we will ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on existing obligations under international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change.@@@We believe that legal clarity from the world’s highest court will help to spur even greater climate action and strengthen the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@We believe in the norms and rules of international law, and we firmly believe that our existing international laws and conventions already contain critical protections for human rights and for the environment.@@@Taking climate change to the International Court of Justice via the General Assembly is not a silver bullet for increasing climate action, but just one tool to get us
closer to the end goal of a safe planet for humankind.@@@The leaders of the Pacific islands continue to show that they are seeking higher levels of climate ambition and collective action.@@@That is why apart from the International Court of Justice, we are supporting several other tools to battle the existential threat of climate change.@@@We are calling on States to join the group of nations proposing to include the crime of ecocide in the Rome Statute.@@@Pursuing actions in the knowledge that they have the potential to inflict severe and widespread or long-term damage on the environment can no longer be tolerated.@@@We are guardians of the future of tomorrow.@@@I acknowledge and commend the work of the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law, led by Antigua and Barbuda, Tuvalu and Palau, to bring to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the issue of climate change as it relates to the law of the sea.@@@We call for the development of a fossil-fuel non-proliferation treaty to phase down coal, oil and gas production in line with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C and enable a just global transition for every worker, community and nation with fossil-fuel dependence.@@@It will be critical to ensure that States revise and enhance their nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement, as Vanuatu did last month according to its agreement in the Glasgow Climate Pact at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@As is clear, we are leaving no stone unturned as we seek solutions to the climate crisis, and I particularly call on Member States to support Vanuatu and our global coalition as we bring an International Court of Justice climate change draft resolution before the General Assembly this session.@@@The nuclear risk still remains and presents an existential threat to the human species and all forms of life that inhabit the Earth.@@@The nuclear risk is becoming even greater, given the Ukraine-Russian war and the intense geopolitical tensions rapidly evolving before us.@@@The lack of consensus at the recent Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has made it harder to achieve nuclear disarmament.@@@That division reveals that the NPT, a central pillar of the international rules-based order, is not seen as a priority by certain nuclear Powers, and that is a major cause of concern for our planet.@@@Like most countries in the world, my country, Vanuatu, was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Our economy is heavily dependent on tourism, and that was halted when borders were closed.@@@Our economic activity declined significantly, and our households’ livelihoods were severely affected.@@@We have been fortunate that the labour mobility programmes that we enjoy with Australia and New Zealand have allowed Vanuatu to export those services, enabling remittance flows that have helped household income and boosted our economy.@@@Furthermore, since most of our population resides in rural areas, the subsistence economy has been able to sustain their livelihoods.@@@In order to avert economic decline and social hardship, the Government responded by implementing stimulus packages that targeted household incomes and provided finance to the commercial sector to keep businesses afloat.@@@We were able to do that thanks to an accumulation of budget surpluses over the past few years.@@@Our Government launched a nation-wide COVID-19 pandemic programme enabling essential supplies to be distributed before the disease reached Vanuatu, and as a result we experienced only a few deaths.@@@As soon as the vaccination rate had reached 70 per cent of our total population, we reopened our borders.@@@On that note, and on behalf of the people and the Government of Vanuatu, I would like to convey my gratitude to all the bilateral and multilateral partners that assisted Vanuatu during that very difficult time.@@@COVID-19 taught us a few lessons, one of which was about the need to ensure that digital inclusion is prioritized in all our economies.@@@When the schools in Vanuatu closed, it was difficult for many students to participate in online classes owing to a lack of connectivity.@@@I am sure that this is something that other developing countries experienced as well, and that is why I believe that digitalization requires a concerted global response and action.@@@Without it, the many goals spelled out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development may not be realized.@@@Vanuatu is gradually recovering from COVID-19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold.@@@Our borders are open and tourism is starting to bounce back.@@@As it stands, we are poised for economic growth of 3 per cent in 2022.@@@The recovery, however, has been undermined by the inflationary pressures posed by rising prices of fuel and food.@@@The recovery is also threatened by climate change and severe weather patterns, as we are about to enter the cyclone season.@@@For Vanuatu, category 5 cyclones are becoming a new normal.@@@Vanuatu’s fragile economic recovery is a story that I am sure is not unique to Vanuatu but is familiar to most small island developing States (SIDS) and other developing countries.@@@Our economic recovery requires not only domestic policies that spur growth and build resilience but also complementary bilateral support measures.@@@One way to do that is to ensure that SIDS have access to concessional financing.@@@As we all know, the current international financial architecture and criteria for financing are inconsistent with the economic realities that SIDS are facing.@@@However, I am delighted to see that the Alliance of Small Island States is working with other United Nations members to craft a multidimensional vulnerability index with a view to accessing concessional financing.@@@I join other leaders in calling on all Member States, and in particular our development partners, to support that important initiative.@@@Our large blue ocean space will continue to present more complex issues that will affect the way we manage our people’s livelihoods.@@@The 2050 Strategy of the Blue Pacific Continent sets out our region’s long-term vision and aspirations — our North Star and guide to sustaining a healthy, wealthy and prosperous future for the generations to come.@@@At this juncture, one issue that has remained gratuitously complex since the birth of our nation is the unjustified and continuing colonial claim over our traditional sovereign waters.@@@The rights of the indigenous people and their entire territorial waters within our region must be restored and affirmed in order to enable our sovereign States to take on and manage the ever-increasing complexity that the blue ocean space presents.@@@In that context, the major security and political issue for my country, Vanuatu, remains the illegal claim on the Matthew and Hunter Islands.@@@Even with human rights principles so well embedded in the Charter of the United Nations and despite countless pleas here in the Assembly, human rights violations continue globally across sovereign and disputed spaces.@@@It is no different in the wider blue Pacific.@@@Drawing inspiration from the Secretary- General’s opening statement on Tuesday (see A/77/ PV.4), global report cards will continue to remind our community that more remains to be done.@@@In conclusion, the challenges before us, which are exacerbated by the deterioration in law and order in many areas around the world, are a sombre reminder that we are still falling short of achieving the ideals envisioned in the Charter.@@@The United Nations, as the heartbeat of multilateralism and global cooperation, remains well placed to address those challenges.@@@It can be done, but only if we trust one another and work together for the betterment of our common humanity.@@@Our children are watching; their future is in our hands.@@@The time to act and lead is now.@@@Let me begin by praising and thanking Almighty God for His everlasting love, peace, mercy and blessings upon the world and each one of us here today.@@@In his holy name, Kam naba bane ni Mauri.@@@I join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi and the Government of Hungary on his election as President of the General Assembly.@@@He may be assured of the full support and cooperation of Kiribati as he steers the helm of the General Assembly to make the seventy-seventh session a watershed moment for the many interlocking challenges facing humankind.@@@By the same token, I congratulate and thank the outgoing President, Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, for a resoundingly successful seventy-sixth session, as demonstrated in the accomplishment of his many new initiatives.@@@He infused a renewed sense of faith and hope in the power of a united humankind and a stronger multilateralism.@@@The most remarkable legacy of his leadership has been the inclusion of underrepresented Member States within the workings of the United Nations.@@@Never before have the small island developing States been as diversely and widely represented within the realms of the Office of the President of the General Assembly.@@@I also thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his stellar and steady leadership, especially during these very difficult and trying times.@@@Kiribati welcomes and fully endorses his reappointment for a second term to further advance and complete a comprehensive overhaul of the United Nations in meeting its obligations for the peoples it serves.@@@We also appreciate the restructuring of the multi-country offices aimed at bringing the United Nations closer to the people on the ground.@@@The establishment of the United Nations multi-country office for the northern Pacific region, which includes Kiribati, is a symbolic notion bringing the United Nations closer for effective and tailored delivery of United Nations agency services.@@@We hope to see more tangible development activities occurring in that remote and underrepresented region of the United Nations.@@@I wish to also acknowledge the great contributions and services that the United Nations agencies have delivered to my country and people.@@@In particular, I would like to convey my sincere gratitude to the United Nations police for all the assistance and support that have enabled our Kiribati police to participate for the first time in United Nations peacekeeping missions, starting with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.@@@Seventy-six years ago, in establishing the Charter of the United Nations, our founding fathers committed to cooperating to prevent future wars and eliminate the root causes of wars and other violent conflicts in society.@@@They agreed to restore the godliness, dignity and worth of the human person and improve the standards of living for all, to name a few.@@@Today we take stock of the progress made towards those goals along with new commitments, and reflect and assess whether we have truly lived up to those values.@@@As a small island developing nation, multilateralism is central to the sustainable development of Kiribati.@@@It offers a variety of opportunities to engage on global
issues that are of importance to the well-being of our people.@@@With an ocean area large enough to fit the whole of Europe, our Kiribati Vision for 20 years and foreign policy objectives have been on the promotion of ocean health and wealth.@@@That includes both the risks from nuclear submersibles traversing our waters and the damaging effects of illegal, unregulated and unreported activities on our fisheries.@@@Most important is the health of our people, especially those who were exposed to the nuclear test blasts on Christmas Island.@@@We are grateful for the leading role, together with Kazakhstan, on articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons concerning assistance for persons and environments harmed by nuclear testing.@@@Two of the initiatives that we proposed are now reflected in the Vienna Action Plan.@@@The first is the establishment of a voluntary trust fund to assist countries, communities, people and environments harmed by nuclear testing.@@@The second is the creation of a scientific advisory body to help provide the science needed to address health and environmental problems occasioned by past nuclear testing.@@@We are grateful to those countries that have already pledged support for and made contributions to those initiatives, especially those that are not yet States parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Let me be clear on this.@@@Humankind should be free now and forever from the testing and use of nuclear weapons.@@@That is why my Government has decided to invite the United Nations to use Kiritimati Island as a global or sub-global centre for anti-nuclear research and related programmes and activities.@@@The choice of theme for the seventy-seventh session could not be more appropriate or timely.@@@A cloud of uncertainty and fear continues to hang over humankind in the light of the two-year coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Communities, families and businesses are still reeling from the effects of the pandemic.@@@Compounding the devastation are the persisting challenges of climate change that have manifested in coastal erosion, reducing available land space, and droughts that have affect the livelihoods of many persons.@@@The Ukraine war has added to the despair and uncertainty through the unnecessary loss of lives, scarcity of food grains, increase in food and fuel prices, interest rates and many more.@@@The consequences of COVID-19, climate change and the war in Ukraine are clear examples of interlocking challenges that must be addressed urgently, using the seventy-seventh session’s motto of solidarity, sustainability and science.@@@Solidarity underscores the sustainability of science and its advances.@@@We saw this through the record-breaking production of vaccines that have saved millions of lives.@@@By emulating the success of sharing vaccine production and science discoveries, we can ensure that many more receive life-saving vaccines and medicines.@@@On that note, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who have assisted the people of Kiribati in many ways by providing vaccines, financial support and others during the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Climate change is another area in which science has made and continues to make advances in our understanding of the root causes and ways to address climate change.@@@However, the lack of solidarity even through multilateralism continues to be the stumbling block to addressing the global climate change emergency.@@@The targets that have been agreed and set under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, including the financial pledges, continue to remain out of reach.@@@Those challenges and the many others that have caused much human suffering in the past seven decades all have one thing in common.@@@They are curated by people in positions of power and influence.@@@Much of that irresponsible, selfish and heartless behaviour is part of what the late Queen Elizabeth II referred to as the darker side of human nature.@@@That darker side harbours negative mindsets and attitudes that give in to greed, hatred and many other vices that breed more bad than good, resulting in conflict, violence across societies and the world at large.@@@Broken humanity can be fixed not by wonderful speeches, meetings, resolutions or international instruments, but by an interplay of greater compassion and solidarity.@@@Sadly, harmful mindsets persist and we ourselves, being a remote country, are far from immune from such.@@@The escalating geostrategic competition in our part of the world means that regionalism and solidarity are at risk of being increasingly used to serve specific national interests, rather than a collective of diverse needs and views working in unison for our common benefit.@@@As is the case now, any differing views and sovereign decisions that deviate are at risk of being vigorously scrutinized and labelled as adversarial through a security lens rather than a genuine desire to pursue sustainable development for the country and its people.@@@Likewise, efforts undertaken by Kiribati to prepare for its graduation from least developed country status, as recommended by the United Nations, are being scrutinized.@@@With limited resources, we are committed to driving our development agenda and ensuring sustainability when we graduate by maximizing benefits from the Phoenix Islands Protected Area and many others.@@@Our development agenda is grounded in our culture, traditional values and norms, practices and aspirations for the benefit of our people.@@@Yet it continues to be oppressed by neo-colonial thinking that does not take our needs, our priorities or our national context into account.@@@A system of global thinking remains and is steeped in legacies of environmental destruction, which our peoples have now inherited, as in the case of the mining of Banaba Island.@@@We must work together to ensure that the solutions and actions to correct these legacies and local watershed moments work hand in hand with actions and solutions for today’s interlocking challenges.@@@Wendell Berry has pointed out that global thinking is often merely a euphemism for abstract anxieties or passions that are useless to engaged efforts to save actual landscapes.@@@Multilateralism should never be viewed as a one-size-fits-all scenario.@@@We are reminded that it is best to orient our work through locally grounded planning and action that focus on the actual scaled down watersheds commonly addressed.@@@We have a duty as leaders entrusted with the power to decide, and as enablers of solutions for the security, peace and well-being of our people that are sustained through education, awareness and financing.@@@Acting together side by side in unison and solidarity, making decisions and taking action based on reality and facts derived from natural law and true science is a precursor for the transformative solutions we need.@@@Let us all agree to make this seventy-seventh session a watershed moment; a moment for renewed and positive mindsets; a moment for true discipleship action; and a moment for a prosperous, peaceful and secure world for all.@@@I believe that together in unison and solidarity, as one human family and with God’s blessings, we can do it.@@@Certainly, we can do it.@@@I conclude by sharing our traditional blessings: Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa.@@@Leave no one behind — those four words are the promise at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@That is the principle to which this United Nations body is committed.@@@But today, more than three and a half years after that commitment was made, smaller nations and younger democracies around the world already feel that was an empty promise.@@@Today not only do smaller nations and younger democracies, such as Malawi, still feel that they have been left behind, but they feel much farther behind than they were before.@@@For instance, we all know that climate change is a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together.@@@Yet, months after Malawi and its Sustainable Development Goal gains were set backwards by two tropical storms in quick succession, we have been left behind.@@@We all know that pandemics are a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together.@@@Yet, in the roll-out of vaccines and the application of travel restrictions, we have been left behind.@@@We all know that regional insecurity is a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together.@@@Yet, in terms of participation in Security Council decisions that affect us, we have been left behind.@@@We all know that food shortage is a global problem that will never be solved until all nations solve it together.@@@Yet, in the allocation of international facilities for agro-based and debt-distressed economies, we have been left behind.@@@As a result of our collective negligence, the global economy is now a house on fire.@@@Yet we continue to use evacuation methods that rush some nations out to safety while leaving the rest of us behind to fend for ourselves in the burning building.@@@However, if we are truly one United Nations family, then leaving no one behind must be practiced, not just preached.@@@If we are truly one United Nations family, we must reject any attempts to politicize human suffering by lobbying us to refuse the help of those some find politically offensive.@@@If we are truly one United Nations family, we must abandon political posturing and welcome more helping hands in resolving the problems that the permanent members of the Security Council have sometimes created and failed to solve alone, namely, the failure to stop environmental degradation, prevent unjust wars, lift unsustainable debt burdens, prevent food insecurity and contain pandemics.@@@How do we get back on track?@@@As I see it, with so many left behind, the only thing to do is to concentrate United Nations support on the most vulnerable who are lagging behind so that they can catch up.@@@Malawi stands ready to do its part in using any new support it receives to make up for lost ground and catch up.@@@On addressing the current global food crisis, Malawi is ready to catch up, having just joined the Feed the Future initiative, which will give us access to new financing in the next few years to use Malawi’s vast arable land and large volumes of fresh water to develop mega farms that will feed the world and lift millions of our farmers out of subsistence living.@@@We are delighted that many private sector investors are flocking to us to join the agricultural revolution that is coming to Malawi, as well as investors in mining, who know that the recent discovery in Malawi of the largest deposit of rutile in the world means that Malawi’s economic rise is imminent.@@@On climate change mitigation and adaptation, Malawi is ready to catch up.@@@With the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held imminently in Sharm-El-Sheikh, we call for action on the pledges that have already been made so that Malawi and other least developed countries (LDCs) can build resilience to climate-change induced events, such as floods, droughts, pests and cyclones — all projected to become more frequent and more severe.@@@Those disasters reverse years of developmental gains.@@@Cyclones Ana and Gombe alone destroyed strategic infrastructure and community assets and displaced thousands of households.@@@One fifth of our people are currently at risk of acute food shortage — 3.6 million Malawians face hunger from next month until March.@@@As we prepare to deploy food assistance from our strategic reserves, we welcome members’ support through early-warning systems for generating and managing climate data to reduce the impact of disasters, as well as technical and financial capacity-building on weather data analysis, modelling and forecasting to address the barriers faced by farmers in accessing useful information.@@@Our ongoing institutionalization of our national climate change fund should help in that regard, as will other measures for making climate financing predictable.@@@Although Malawi and other least developed countries contribute the least to climate change, we are committed to the global climate agenda.@@@Malawi’s own ambition is to cut carbon emissions by half before the year 2040, and we therefore call for support for our efforts to transition to clean and green energy.@@@On dealing with the evolving challenge of the coronavirus disease, Malawi is again ready to catch up.@@@Crucial to that effort is obtaining access to vaccines, and members’ support to our efforts to catch up in that area will strengthen our vaccine-delivery systems in general.@@@However, the critical need for us is to strengthen health systems more broadly in order to build resilience against future pandemics, which calls for investment in health infrastructure and research.@@@In that context, the news that six African States have been chosen to produce messenger RNA vaccines in Africa is music to my ears.@@@I am proud of Malawi’s advocacy of that approach, as well as Malawi’s role as a co-pioneer of An Accord for a Healthier World, which was announced by Pfizer in Davos four months ago and aims to bring quality medicines to 1.2 billion people in low- income countries.@@@Those action-oriented partnerships are examples of the importance of Sustainable Development Goal 17 in the advancement of all other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@We own the SDGs fully, and Malawi has so far undertaken two voluntary national reviews since 2020 in order to strengthen its national ownership of the SDGs.@@@However, we see global private-public partnerships as essential to reclaiming the gains we have lost towards achieving the SDGs in the recent months of global crises.@@@It is because of our collaborative approach that we are on track to implement 60 per cent of the Goals.@@@We are now in the process of reviewing the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for the period 2024 to 2028 so that it is responsive to national development plans, linked to the delivery of the SDGs.@@@In that spirit of partnership, we also plan to make full use of the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031 in order to catch up even more on achieving the SDGs.@@@Speaking of LDCs, it is my pleasure as Chair to invite members to the fifth United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, to be held in Doha in March 2023, where even more partnerships will be forged around creating solutions for vulnerable countries.@@@One problem in desperate need of a solution for the most vulnerable LDCs is the unsustainable debt levels and distress they bear.@@@It is not for nothing that the scriptures, which are regarded as sacred in more than half the world, describe unsustainable debt as a form of slavery.@@@As leaders of generations past worked together to end old forms of slavery, we must also work together to end this new form.@@@Recently, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund called on the world’s major lenders to show leadership by relieving vulnerable countries of the debts that shackle them, because even loans that were given and received in good faith have become unsustainable in the recent and current climate of relentless and unforeseen external shocks.@@@I therefore join her in reiterating that call and commend the People’s Republic of China for leading by example by fulfilling the pledge it made at last year’s Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to forgive interest- free loans owed by 17 African countries.@@@Let that be the beginning of breaking the chains holding vulnerable countries back, not the end, because when we say that we are leaving no one behind, that is one way to put our money where our mouth is.@@@Let me hasten to add that, as President of a country that stands to benefit from debt-relief measures, I do not regard my country as entitled to such.@@@In fact, I am fully committed to being held accountable for the responsible use of those lifejackets.@@@I recognize that we must also prove ourselves worthy of such assistance by using it to cushion our citizens against the worsening financial volatility, trade cost and human suffering that debt and other external factors cause.@@@Indeed, there must be no Member State in our midst that is beyond scrutiny or exempt from accountability.@@@For that to become a reality, United States President Biden’s recent call for the United Nations family to defend the rights of smaller nations as equals of larger ones must not only be applauded, but it must be uploaded.@@@As African Member States, we do not wish to gather here next year with no progress made on the African Union’s Ezulwini Consensus, which demands two permanent seats with veto power and five non-permanent seats for Africa.@@@Following the strong
signal of support from the Government of the United States, we expect to see that matter on its way to the Security Council to be proposed, discussed and decided.@@@That is the United Nations we want.@@@That is the United Nations the world needs — a reformed United Nations that practices the equality and democracy it preaches; a reformed United Nations that is not constantly polarized by nuclear Powers, stuck in Cold War mindsets; a reformed United Nations that uses its multilateral muscle to give equal attention to the interlocking issues of public health, food insecurity, climate change and conflict, regardless of where they emerge or whom they affect; a reformed United Nations that gives equal weight to all States Members that give it meaning, not just those that give it money.@@@That is because we are one humankind, facing the same storm in the same boat.@@@In that spirit of one humankind, let me conclude by expressing my country’s deepest condolences to the British royal family and to the people and the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth on the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, who was laid to rest on the eve of the Assembly’s high- level debate week.@@@I thank Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, for this opportunity, and I congratulate him on his election, as I wish outgoing President Abdulla Shahid the very best in his continued service to humankind and the cause of leaving no one behind.@@@I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead the General Assembly.@@@You can be assured of our full commitment to the successful execution of your mandate, including from our position as a Vice-President this session.@@@I also acknowledge your predecessor for his sterling stewardship of the Assembly during his presidency of hope.@@@This year, Jamaica celebrates 60 years of independence and membership in the United Nations.@@@We reflect with pride on the significant contributions that Jamaica, a small island developing State, has made to global efforts for peace, development and human rights, as well as in the fields of music, culture and sports.@@@At home, our diamond jubilee of independence has provided the impetus for us to reignite our nation for greatness.@@@It is our intention to bring that same energy to the work of the seventy-seventh session.@@@We gather as the world faces unprecedented overlapping crises:	the	ongoing impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic; the war in Ukraine; inflation; debt; energy and food insecurity; and natural disasters fuelled by climate change.@@@We do not all have the same capacity to withstand and recover from such shocks.@@@Indeed, recovery has been uneven, and there has been a further widening of pre-existing development inequalities.@@@As we search for solutions, let us acknowledge the differentiated needs and vulnerability of all members of our global family.@@@Small island developing States and some middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable to climate and external economic shocks, which have an oversized impact relative to their national budgets and an often-crippling impact on their infrastructure.@@@In order for small island developing States to survive economic shocks and recover lost and damaged infrastructure, they are forced to borrow, only to be confronted again in a few years with another round of natural disasters that could wipe out significant infrastructure and force us to add to our already high debt.@@@As I speak, I am monitoring a tropical system that is threatening the Caribbean.@@@Jamaica believes that a comprehensive and targeted approach to accessing development finance is needed.@@@We fully support the work of the high-level panel developing a multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@We eagerly anticipate an era of truly equitable access to concessional financing and other funding support
that will enable us to invest in resilient infrastructure and create fiscal buffers so that we can withstand and recover quickly from the next economic, health or climate shock with little borrowing.@@@Without the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a basis for access to finance, small island developing States will continue to struggle and will be unable to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Even as we call for reforms of the global financial architecture to account for vulnerability, Jamaica is exercising great fiscal discipline.@@@It has been a long and hard struggle, but we have lowered our ratio of debt to gross domestic product from stratospheric levels a decade ago, and we continue to pursue policies to ensure that we can drive down our debt.@@@We are building fiscal buffers to help us respond quickly to shocks.@@@We are working with our development partners using innovative financing tools, such as floating a catastrophe bond to insure us against climate disasters.@@@Most important, we are mainstreaming climate resilience in all our infrastructure investments.@@@Small island developing States such as Jamaica are always mindful that despite their best efforts to improve fiscal management and debt sustainability, a single climate event could wipe out 100 per cent of a country’s economy in a few hours.@@@Climate change is an immediate existential threat for small island developing States such as Jamaica.@@@Concerted action to slow down and halt global temperature rise is literally a question of our survival.@@@While we continue to develop our own resilience and play our part in mitigating climate change, we cannot change the trajectory by our actions alone.@@@Jamaica looks forward to the convening of the twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt later this year.@@@We call on all countries to meet their commitments and contributions to climate targets.@@@We also call on the countries of the developed world to increase their commitments and ambitions in climate financing, especially for adaptation and loss and damage.@@@As an island, Jamaica is keenly attuned to the importance of protecting and sustainably using its ocean and marine resources.@@@We recognize that urgent action is needed to address the health and sustainability of the oceans.@@@Jamaica joins the global community in celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which opened for adoption in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on 10 December 1982.@@@The Convention is a testament to the power of multilateralism.@@@As the constitution for the ocean, the Convention has yielded immense benefit since its entry into force.@@@Since 1994, Jamaica has welcomed representatives to the International Seabed Authority who have brought to life its important deliberations on the preservation and exploitation of the resources of the international seabed, which forms part of the common heritage of humankind.@@@The pandemic has made it clear that for developing countries, major and inclusive transformations are required in the areas of technology and innovation.@@@While all countries suffered during the pandemic, they did not all suffer equally.@@@A country’s economic resilience was often a reflection of how digitally advanced it was.@@@Many countries lag far behind in digital access, penetration and capability.@@@We must prioritize bridging the digital divide both within and between countries, to create a level playing field and spur a transformation of critical sectors of the economy and the society.@@@As the world prepares for an even more digitally engaged future, we must take effective steps to protect cyberspace and its physical infrastructure to ensure that it is safely and securely available to all users across the world.@@@Cybercrime is an increasing threat and international cooperation is required to deal with it in a comprehensive manner.@@@Jamaica fully supports the work under way in the United Nations to formulate a cybercrime treaty and come up with guidelines and a framework for cybersecurity.@@@A number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are facing an epidemic of crime and violence.@@@Since the pandemic and the disruption in education, mental-health challenges are increasingly being expressed in violent ways.@@@A propensity to try to resolve conflict or cope with social and mental stresses through violence requires a public health response, and Jamaica has not only engaged in global initiatives such as the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, but it has also recently empanelled a National Commission on Violence Prevention to advise the Government on building an articulated public health and social services response.@@@However, the situation is exponentially complicated and exacerbated by the influx of illegal and unregistered small arms into our country.@@@Whether among organized transnational criminal enterprises, street-level gangs or misguided young people in inner cities, the availability of guns is driving an ever-increasing homicide rate.@@@In the same way that a war on drugs is being prosecuted in which we have been faithful partners in policing what comes through
our waters or leaves our shores, there must now be a war on guns.@@@Jamaica does not manufacture guns, but its population suffers from the effects of their wide availability.@@@The countries that manufacture weapons that are available to the public must implement stronger measures to ensure that those weapons do not end up on the streets and in the hands of people for whom they were not intended.@@@In the same way that there is concern about illegal drugs on the streets of rich countries, there must be concern about guns on the streets of developing countries such as Jamaica.@@@The situation in our sister Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country of Haiti is one of deep concern for Jamaica and the region.@@@The challenges there — political, economic, environmental and social — are longstanding and present serious obstacles to the peace and dignity of the Haitian people.@@@Indeed, they present challenges for the region, particularly where crime and other security issues are concerned.@@@We support a Haitian-led process to arrive at sustainable solutions to those challenges, and together with CARICOM and the international community, we are committed to moving beyond just standing with Haiti to working more closely with Haiti to provide consistent and meaningful support.@@@Jamaica also once again joins the calls for discontinuing the economic, commercial and financial embargo on our closest Caribbean neighbour, Cuba.@@@We cannot properly make use of this watershed moment to benefit the future without adequately addressing the past.@@@Jamaica reaffirms its determination to further the call for the international recognition of reparative justice as a necessary path to healing, the restoration of dignity and progress for people of African descent.@@@The world cannot turn a blind eye to the systemic imbalances that persist after centuries of exploitation.@@@If the moral standard today by which we claim a higher civilization acknowledges that actions in the past that generated wealth for some by depriving others of their freedom were wrong, then that same moral standard must lead those who benefited from the wrongs of the past and claim a higher civilization today to repair that which their morality now acknowledges to be an injustice.@@@There is an inescapable duty to make economic redress for historical injustices and recognize the dignity of the States and peoples affected.@@@The arc of international morality will not complete its bend for the peoples of the African diaspora without open and inclusive exchanges on the dispensation of reparative justice.@@@We recognize the complexities associated with that sensitive issue.@@@Yet as with all complex global challenges, we must summon the determination to take bold and creative steps to meet the moment.@@@Since Jamaica attained independence 60 years ago, multilateralism has been a core principle of its foreign policy.@@@It continues to underpin our cooperation with Member States and other stakeholders within the United Nations system.@@@Transformative global solutions can thrive only within a robust multilateral framework.@@@The current global political and security environment is cause for great alarm.@@@We have witnessed a nuclear armed super-Power, a permanent member of the Security Council, acting with impunity to launch a military offensive against its neighbour.@@@Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine can only be condemned as a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We must never return to the days when military might is considered right.@@@Jamaica strongly cautions against actions that could signal the demise of a peaceful multilateral order.@@@I commend the Secretary-General and his team for the initiatives undertaken within his purview to fulfil relevant mandates.@@@For their part, Member States must also address long-standing issues of reform and restructuring, including with regard to the Security Council.@@@That critical organ must work more transparently and responsively.@@@It must be more representative of the world of today and more prepared for the world of tomorrow.@@@A rotating seat for small island developing States would ensure that their unique perspectives, challenges and contributions are permanently available to the Council, thereby improving the quality of its service and work for our people.@@@As a highly tourism-dependent country in the most tourism-dependent region of the world, Jamaica has invested heavily in building resilience in the tourism sector.@@@During the pandemic we pioneered the introduction of resilient corridors on the island, which served as a focused, protocol-based and data-driven blueprint for safely reopening tourism and assisted greatly in fast-tracking our tourism sector’s recovery.@@@We have been engaging countries across the world in our efforts to bolster resilience in global tourism, and Jamaica is proposing officially designating 17 February as Global Tourism Resilience Day every year.@@@That annual commemoration would serve to encourage a consistent examination of resilience-building in the tourism sector, in the face of persistent global disruptions to sustainable tourism and development.@@@We encourage the global community to work with us to
commemorate the first Global Tourism Resilience Day in 2023.@@@In conclusion, while our current reality presents complex challenges, I believe that the capacity and capabilities exist within in this body to overcome those challenges.@@@The gap between the challenges we face and the solutions that exist or have yet to be created is the human will.@@@The General Assembly is about developing the common global political will to see this time as a watershed moment to deploy and accelerate transformative solutions to the interlocking challenges we face.@@@The people of the world are counting on us to lead and work together as one humankind — one love.@@@Jamaica is committed to doing its part, in this its sixtieth year of membership and in the years ahead.@@@I extend Samoa’s congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@He can be assured of Samoa’s full support in the successful execution of his mandate over the next 12 months.@@@It is an honour for me to address the Assembly in person as Samoa’s Prime Minister as part of the yearlong celebratory events of the sixtieth anniversary of our independence since we became independent in 1962.@@@Samoa has for decades championed the importance of the rule of law and the protection of human rights.@@@Many labelled the events that unfolded following our 2021 elections a constitutional crisis.@@@While those were difficult times for Samoa, they were also key to our forward journey as a maturing democracy.@@@They divided our country and tested the key pillars of our society: our faith, our culture and the rule of law.@@@However, my delivering this statement today as the first female Prime Minister of Samoa and bringing about a change in Government after four decades are testaments to the fact that the rule of law has prevailed.@@@Samoa today remains peaceful and stable, despite all the challenges we lived through.@@@My Government will continue to safeguard the rights of all its citizens, especially the most vulnerable, by strengthening appropriate social protection measures and prioritizing assistance for those most in need.@@@We have focused on people-centred development as pivotal to the implementation of our development agenda over the next five years.@@@Samoa presented its third universal periodic review in November 2021.@@@We maintain that our Christian values, unique culture and traditions complement our human rights obligations and fundamental freedoms, which we have committed to promote, respect, protect and fulfil.@@@As we take stock of the global challenges we face, we highlight the need for sustainable measures to address economic recovery following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and urge all nations to resolve and work towards peace and security, enhance resilience from climate change impacts and achieve our Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda.@@@The theme of this year’s general debate, “A watershed moment:	transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, resonates with Samoa as we clearly recognize that the world is at a critical moment in the history of the United Nations, owing to complex and interconnected crises.@@@We need an effective United Nations to mobilize our collective efforts and to propel urgent actions to address those issues.@@@The achievement of the SDGs must be the driving force in our collective efforts over the next eight years.@@@Together, we must elevate our actions with a sense of urgency to address the climate emergency or our planet will be lost to us and to future generations.@@@Though we are far removed from the centres of conflict, resultant escalating fuel and food prices and threats of nuclear weapons use have reached our isolation.@@@Yet no one empathizes with the war climate is waging on atoll islanders watching their maritime boundaries disappear fast with sea-level rise.@@@Samoa stands ready to meet its obligations and commitments to achieving the SDGs.@@@There is a need to strengthen capacity-building at all levels, enhance data and information collection and storage through national and regional climate change portals, as well as invest in robust systems and processes, including reporting and verification, and knowledge brokerage.@@@Improving resilience actions through learning and developing knowledge societies will enable adaptation and responsiveness to future crises.@@@Both the global financial and governance systems are desperately in need of reform.@@@As the Secretary- General lucidly puts it, the global financial system is morally bankrupt, and it favours the rich and punishes the poor.@@@That must change.@@@The approval and effective implementation of the multidimensional vulnerability index will be a move in the right direction in addressing that imbalance and make the global financial architecture fit for purpose by tackling the financing gaps of small island developing States (SIDS).@@@The full support of all our development partners, international financial institutions and multilateral development banks is critical in ensuring the effective implementation of the multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@Small island developing States face a unique set of vulnerabilities that impede their ability to achieve sustainable development.@@@The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated those vulnerabilities, with many SIDS being particularly affected by the drop in international tourism and remittances.@@@Consequently, the timely call for and endorsement of a multidimensional vulnerability index will allow for the inclusion of more than just income-based criteria to assess eligibility for concessional finance.@@@A universal multidimensional vulnerability index could be viewed as the foundation upon which the key principles guiding specific responses to our vulnerabilities are anchored.@@@It is an option and not a hindrance.@@@It should be perceived as the landing zone upon which specific responses could be framed depending on the circumstances involved.@@@It is a tool that provides for a richer lens on vulnerability and resilience; its adoption and full implementation are therefore critical to our economic recovery.@@@Climate change remains our number one priority.@@@The scientific evidence is clear and irrefutable.@@@For Pacific communities, the main challenge is securing action for survival, and we all need to shoulder our responsibilities and play our part.@@@The big polluters and emitters have a moral obligation and responsibility to
meet their commitments ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), because they hold the key to our achieving the 1.5°C promise of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@We call on all parties to commit to more ambitious nationally determined contributions to meet the Paris Agreement promise, as we are all part of the solution.@@@Our global commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement is critical.@@@Even if warming is limited to 1.5°C, SIDS will continue to incur severe loss and damage.@@@We must therefore promote recovery investments that are climate-smart, resilient and in line with net-zero emissions by 2050.@@@We are at the doorstep of COP27.@@@We must work diligently to generate solutions to meet expectations.@@@The achievement of a 50/50 split between mitigation and adaptation funding is of paramount importance to Samoa and SIDS.@@@We should not put out the flame of loss and damage.@@@Natural disasters continue to devastate countless lives.@@@Recent climate events are transboundary and drive home the reality that no country is immune to the impacts of climate change.@@@Those environmental threats will worsen.@@@The triple planetary crisis is the alarm knell that is reminding us that we are putting immeasurable pressure on the planet.@@@Our relentless need to extract resources from nature is causing disruptions, propelling climate change, destroying nature and raising pollution levels.@@@Any response programmes must be informed by our commitment to science for informed policy and law and institutions that strengthen environmental governance.@@@We seek to further enable change through transformations in finance and economic systems and by leveraging data and technology for the environment.@@@Small island developing States like Samoa do not always have the requisite levels of capabilities and capacity to repurpose and redirect financial and economic systems towards sustainability, improve the effectiveness of legal frameworks, deliver science as the catalyst for action and be digitally connected.@@@The ocean is in us, and we are the ocean.@@@It is the lifeblood of our blue Pacific nations — the lungs of our planet.@@@But while its sustainable use provides a strategic pathway towards our sustainable development, we must also address the associated risks.@@@The health of the ocean is a key priority.@@@We must therefore continue to advance work on the ocean-climate nexus, such as by empowering women, girls and youth with relevant knowledge and skills to contribute to the health of the ocean.@@@The recent Our Ocean Conference in Palau and the second Ocean Conference in Lisbon were opportunities to take stock of SDG 14 and we welcome the call for more investment in making the ocean and its resources more sustainable.@@@Of all the SDGs, life below water is the most underfunded.@@@That must change.@@@We need to attract and retain sustainable and innovative investment, including foreign direct investment through blending, guarantees and other innovative financial instruments.@@@Our global community must focus on the work that remains to be accomplished.@@@The pledges and commitments made at those two conferences and at COP26 are inconsequential if they are not delivered on time to effect actions on the ground.@@@Samoa’s marine protection goals, outlined in our first ocean strategy, are aligned to the Blue Leaders 30x30 campaign, as are calls for protecting 30 per cent of our global oceans by 2030.@@@We welcome the complementarity of such initiatives and encourage others to join.@@@The Pacific Ocean hosts a remarkable array of biodiversity.@@@With our blue Pacific family, Samoa continues to prioritize both marine and terrestrial ecosystems restoration.@@@We remain engaged in the Convention on Biological Diversity process.@@@Together with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP27, 2022 is a critical year for aligning action to tackle the climate emergency and addressing the threats posed by biodiversity loss.@@@The Pacific SIDS subscribe to the position that preserving maritime zones and the rights and entitlements that flow from them give expression not only to the foundational principles of equity and stability, but also to the notion of climate justice deeply rooted in human rights and the principles of international law.@@@In that vein, we urge all Member States to inject a sense of urgency into efforts to conclude negotiations on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond areas of national jurisdiction.@@@Samoa pledges its support to the Vanuatu initiative to seek an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on climate change.@@@We must unite to prevent and reduce marine pollution, including plastics, oil spills, waste discharge and nuclear contaminants.@@@If we continue down the current path, we will fish out of our oceans more plastics than fish.@@@Pacific SIDS contribute less than 1.3 per cent of the mismanaged plastics in the world’s oceans yet are among the main recipients of plastics pollution and its impacts.@@@The effects of overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing are a major concern for Pacific economies.@@@Lost revenues are in the billions.@@@The increased acidification of our ocean is already destroying entire reef ecosystems.@@@Reef damage affects fish population, which in turn affects entire fisheries upon which we rely for our livelihoods.@@@The global food system is at a critical stage, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, the onslaught of climate change and the ongoing war in Ukraine.@@@The Food Systems Summit held last year mobilized the global community to find transformative solutions.@@@Samoa was pleased to be part of that important event, which encouraged shared exploration of potential for collective action.@@@Through organized dialogues, Samoa benefited from a comprehensive assessment of the issues involved in building the sustainability of our food systems.@@@Access to a balanced and nutritional diet is crucial and requires a return to locally produced, high-quality fresh foods and less of processed imported foods.@@@That will be key to addressing the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which represent the single largest cause of premature mortality in the Pacific countries, including Samoa.@@@With support from our development partners, the Samoa Government launched the first comprehensive NCD control programme among Pacific Island countries, in May 2020.@@@Its aim was to build people-centred and systematic NCD service provision in Samoa to strengthen primary health care, empower community participation, promote early detection and effective referral of NCDs, and increase population awareness of NCD risk factors.@@@We continue to call for a future of peaceful and open societies, free from wars, nuclear weapons and the threat of terrorism.@@@The Boe Declaration on Regional Security defines for the Pacific what constitutes security concerns.@@@Those are primarily non-conventional in nature, ranging from climate to environmental and resource security, human and cybersecurity, and transnational crimes.@@@The 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, adopted by Pacific Island Forum leaders at their July 2022 meeting, will support and strengthen the key tenets of the Boe Declaration.@@@While Samoa welcomes development partners on our terms, we note with concern the ongoing geopolitical posturing in our region and call for our national and collective interests to be placed at the forefront, for a peaceful and secure blue Pacific continent.@@@We are concerned about the serious shortfalls in the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, noting that nuclear-weapon States have spent billions of dollars on modernizing and maintaining their nuclear arsenals rather than on helping the victims of past use and testing of nuclear weapons and focusing on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The increasing use of information and communications technology has raised issues of security and privacy.@@@Online cybercriminal activities have increased, including the dissemination of disinformation and the misuse of information.@@@We rely on our collective responsibility as a global community to prevent and combat high-tech cyber- and electronic crimes.@@@Samoa believes those are crucial processes at the multilateral level in ensuring that cyberspace is safe for all.@@@We therefore need to work together to combat and eliminate those destabilizing activities.@@@Accelerated action to meet the promise of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs is an imperative.@@@COVID-19 and climate change have uprooted and even reversed hard- fought development gains.@@@However, we must persist to meet the SDGs, as they provide the best option for a brighter future and countering the threats posed by the climate crisis.@@@We should not forget the commitments and undertakings made towards the full implementation of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA)@@@Pathway.@@@I thank all SIDS partners and the Secretary- General for their continuous support and commitment to that task.@@@The proposed monitoring framework for the SAMOA@@@Pathway is a necessary tool for followup action and review, allowing for effective resource allocation and accountability.@@@Outstanding issues relating to the framework must be concluded urgently, considering the fast-approaching timeline set out in the Secretary-General’s report on that matter (A/73/226),
as well as the fast-approaching timeline of the 2024 SIDS conference.@@@No country should be placed in a situation of choosing between rebuilding its economy and servicing its debt obligations.@@@The March 2021 report of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that SIDS simply cannot support their SDGs and fund their core needs on their own under the prevailing conditions of economic contraction.@@@Tourism may never return to pre-COVID-19 levels.@@@Aviation services will be slow to recover, and one casualty of the pandemic, in our case, was the recent demise of our national airline, Samoa Airways.@@@Many Pacific Island countries rely on remittances from diasporas and communities.@@@Apart from being an important source of income for families and foreign exchange reserves for Governments, remittances are an important buffer in periods of economic shocks and natural disasters.@@@Yet the cost of sending remittances to the Pacific is over 10 per cent, which is higher than the global average and 7 per cent higher than the target set by the SDGs.@@@According to the 2021 IMF report, the Pacific region is in a recession.@@@Income, demand for regional exports and tourism receipts have all recorded reductions, while public spending continues on an upward trajectory.@@@The projected outcome is a greater risk of debt distress.@@@It is also the case that most of the Pacific debts are with multilateral agencies.@@@While the adoption of austerity measures is an option, there is also the real possibility that this may worsen poverty and undermine economic recovery.@@@Multilateralism and united international cooperation are our best response to the many threats we face, as building resilience at the national level can only take us so far.@@@Samoa is confident that despite all the challenges — existential threats for some of us — there is still hope if there is unity among our United Nations family.@@@We need to change our world for the better and leave hope for our future generations.@@@The COVID-19 situation, forcing border lockdowns and state-of-emergency restrictions further emphasize the importance of digitalization for the SIDS to build resilience and meet the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Samoa will continue to prioritize the need to invest in digital technologies and promote a digital economy and connectivity.@@@This is key to stimulating business opportunities and increasing productivity and growth in more traditional sectors, such as agriculture and tourism.@@@Investment in innovation and digitalization for Samoa can enable more efficient delivery of health and education, improve connectivity between rural and urban communities, advance economic empowerment for women and youth, and assist with more efficient public-service delivery.@@@To fully realize the benefits of a digital economy, Samoans must be able to connect with and trust the technology; an enabling business environment must be in place; and investment in education, skills, and digital literacy is paramount.@@@The availability of fast, reliable and affordable internet services to Government, the business community and the public is crucial.@@@In the agriculture and health sectors, we are investing in digital solutions for contact-tracing and for information-sharing between farmers.@@@We recently launched our e-health system to improve medical record-keeping and strengthen health information and vital statistics.@@@More importantly, as we expect increasing health-security threats, this e-health system will be vital to protecting the health and well-being of our population and enhance its resilience.@@@Our experiences with COVID-19 and the ongoing fight with climate change reinforce our conviction of the importance of technology and online distance learning to provide access to quality education for all.@@@We should not lose sight of the fact that, while pursuing these home-grown solutions, we do not end up creating disparity between those who can and those who cannot gain access to or afford these solutions.@@@But I am convinced that embracing technology and knowledge-sharing for our people will be a powerful driver for change, innovation and welfare.@@@The report of the Secretary-General entitled “Our Common Agenda” (A/75/982) highlights the urgency of reforming our global governance system.@@@The coronavirus disease is upending our world, threatening our health, destroying economies and livelihoods and deepening poverty and inequalities.@@@Increasingly, people are turning their backs on the values of trust in and solidarity with one another — the very values we need to rebuild our world and secure a better, more sustainable future for our people and our planet.@@@We agreed that our challenges are interconnected, cross borders and all other divides and can only be addressed by an equally interconnected response, through reinvigorated multilateralism with the United Nations at the centre of our efforts.@@@“Our Common Agenda” is,
above all, an agenda of action designed to accelerate the implementation of existing agreements, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and it is our road map to recapturing this positive spirit and beginning to rebuild our world and mend the trust in one another that is needed at this moment in history.@@@Just as with the Security Council and the global financial system, Samoa is convinced that now is the opportune moment to bring about reforms that would make our global response to future crises and emergencies more effective and timelier, and that an all-United Nations institutional approach is a necessity.@@@In conclusion, let me end by reaffirming Samoa’s commitment to the United Nations and our conviction that it remains the foremost forum to address all issues that transcend national boundaries.@@@As we look to the future, the collective hope for humankind is for leaders to take tough decisions for the health of our planet.@@@Entrenched positions detached from today’s realities and designed to pursue unrelated agendas do not have a place in our collective efforts.@@@While we need to make bold and courageous decisions, let us protect the safety nets crucial to our existence.@@@There is a saying in my country that goes
“Aua le naunau i le i’a ae ia manumanu@@@i le upegcT, which translates to
“Hunger not for the fish at the risk of ruining
your net”.@@@I am grateful to be able to make this statement on behalf of my country.@@@At the outset, allow me to address Mr. Korosi, Director of Environmental Sustainability at the Office of the President of Hungary.@@@His election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session sends a clear message about the road mapped out for us by this annual meeting of the United Nations.@@@I offer him my sincere congratulations.@@@I would also like to warmly commend the Secretary-General for his ongoing commitment and dedication at the helm of the United Nations.@@@On behalf of the people of Madagascar, I would also like to take the opportunity provided by this forum to reiterate our deepest condolences to the British people.@@@Queen Elizabeth II inspired several generations in her country and all over the world.@@@I also want to congratulate His Majesty King Charles III and wish him good health and a blessed reign.@@@The annual meeting of the General Assembly is always an opportunity to highlight the aspiration that unites us, that is, universal peace.@@@Now that we have learned to live with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which we have discussed at length over the past two years, we are still facing the consequences of the crisis, despite everything.@@@It has shown us that it is at the most difficult times that we realize the importance of solidarity among nations.@@@The theme of this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is very apt.@@@It gives us new hope, reassures us and gives us new hope that we can advance together along the path of development.@@@When we had to tackle the health crisis, we chose to put our trust in our scientists and in the wealth of Earth’s natural resources.@@@The establishment of the Pharmalagasy pharmaceutical plant, at the height of the health crisis, demonstrated that we could turn difficulties into opportunities in order to exploit our biodiversity and thereby protect our population.@@@While we predicted the apocalypse for Africa, Madagascar’s infection and death rates are among the lowest in the world.@@@We have been classified as a green zone, meaning a country with low risks of infection.@@@At the moment no PCR tests or health certificates are required to enter Madagascar.@@@We beat the statistics and emerged from the crisis stronger, and above all, more committed to ensuring our country’s development.@@@The world was just beginning to recover from the pandemic when new crises emerged.@@@No country was spared the effects of COVID-19, and the conflict in Ukraine has worsened instability and heightened inequalities.@@@That is yet another major obstacle to our efforts to achieve resilience and post-COVID recovery.@@@Like every other country in the world, we are experiencing the full inflationary effects of this crisis.@@@We firmly believe that all wars end around the table.@@@Dialogue is the only way to bring about peace.@@@Madagascar therefore reiterates its call for dialogue to resolve the conflict, because its effects are global and
becoming more burdensome by the day.@@@Developing nations such as ours are feeling and paying the price.@@@The crucial role of the United Nations must be to encourage multilateralism in order to find equitable solutions that take into account the strengths and weaknesses of every country and its people.@@@How can we accept the fact that in this time of crisis, countries with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of more than $100,000 and others with per capita GDP of less than $600 are buying barrels of oil in the same market and at the same price?@@@Our Organization should take measures to support low-income countries so that they can benefit from and supply themselves with oil at equitable prices, given that the current global situation is a source of major upheaval in a number of countries.@@@Some States are now affected by instability.@@@The social fabric is unravelling, and economies are increasingly fragile.@@@Some States have been forced to raise fuel prices by 50 per cent, which has resulted in riots and socioeconomic disturbances.@@@Recovery is a concern that we all share.@@@Our solidarity is the only way we can heal our societies, revive our economies, support growth and establish peace.@@@Every country has now had to review its development strategies, and that has emphasized how essential it is for each of us to accelerate industrialization and become self-sufficient.@@@We continue to believe that we should produce and process everything that our populations need domestically.@@@There are weapons more powerful than bombs, tanks and missiles, which are our lands, our raw materials, our natural resources and our people.@@@Local industrialization, agricultural innovation and leadership are our ammunition in the work of strengthening ourselves and our armour in order to protect our peoples.@@@In Madagascar, we have developed a detailed strategy to make up for the delays our development has suffered.@@@We developed our 2019-2023 Madagascar Emergency Plan and began to implement it when I took office as President in 2019.@@@Our vision is clear and reflected in our political will, which we have demonstrated through all of our actions.@@@We have prioritized a sector- and project-based approach in order to raise Madagascar’s classification to that of a newly emerging country.@@@We have launched an ambitious set of reforms to modernize our administration, develop our human capital and foster strong, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, with energy as the driving force of its development.@@@Madagascar is a country that is blessed with water resources for hydroelectric dams, a high number of sunshine hours for solar power plants and wind power for wind farms.@@@Many countries are facing energy problems today, and we must therefore accelerate our renewable energy production so that we can achieve self-sufficiency in the next five years.@@@We intend to double or even triple our energy production capacity.@@@It is 2022.@@@Regrettably, Africa is still a continent where most families live in darkness and obscurity.@@@More than 600 million Africans, including 85 per cent of Malagasy households, still use candles and oil lamps to light their homes.@@@That is why we are launching a major operation to equip most Malagasy homes with solar kits by the end of next year, with some of them, of course, subsidized by the State.@@@In achieving that, Madagascar intends to be the first or one of the first countries on the African continent to have brought light to all its people.@@@Climate change is one of the major challenges of our time and one that we all have to tackle.@@@It is important and urgent that we mobilize our joint efforts to protect our planet.@@@I would like to raise the alarm here about commitments that were made at the twenty- first Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and reaffirmed at COP26, regarding the creation of the Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to be funded annually in the amount of $100 billion.@@@Madagascar was the fifth African country to complete its national adaptation plan, and my country therefore should have been a beneficiary of the Fund.@@@However, the access to funding is slow and so far none of the commitments have been upheld.@@@It is unfair that the least-polluting nations should pay the highest price for the impact of climate change.@@@Madagascar is an island and therefore vulnerable to climate hazards.@@@This year alone, five cyclones struck the island in the space of just two months.@@@Some 178,000 hectares of arable land were flooded and destroyed.@@@Our island is the first country to have endured a climate-induced famine.@@@Water resources are drying up in the south of the country and the people in that area are the most vulnerable on the island.@@@The effects of climate change are worsening.@@@The global situation is calling us to action.@@@How many high-level meetings, summits and international conferences have we already had?@@@How many statements and commitments have we made?@@@Now we have to transform our words into
actions.@@@Today I am relaying the cries and the voices of the African continent in general and Madagascar in particular.@@@Africa’s young people and indeed the entire continent are waiting for polluting countries to comply with the agreements they have made.@@@Keeping those promises will protect our planet.@@@Our populations demand that those promises be kept, and future generations will hold us accountable later.@@@Environmental protection issues are particularly dear to my heart.@@@We all know that forests are the lungs of the Earth, and yet the use of charcoal and firewood remains standard practice across the African continent, including by 92 per cent of the population of my country.@@@A family using charcoal or firewood for cooking destroys approximately one hectare of forest every year, which is devastating.@@@We must change the practice and the mindset.@@@That is why Madagascar will equip 250,000 families with bioethanol stoves with the aim of preserving 250,000 hectares of our forest every year.@@@We have started major public works projects to transform the country because everything needs to be built or rebuilt.@@@Everything is urgent, and everything is a priority.@@@For the past almost four years, we have been constantly building and repairing roads.@@@We have built schools, health centres, hospitals, dams, courts, prisons in line with international standards, sporting and cultural facilities and much more.@@@And Madagascar is continually evolving, despite the successive global crises.@@@Ours is a large country and considerable work has been done to ensure that all areas are accessible.@@@However, the road is still a long and winding one.@@@But we have faith, and we will continue to move forward with determination.@@@The Madagascar Emergency Plan is literally paving the way for the future.@@@From north to south and east to west, all of Madagascar is under construction.@@@Only last week we opened our state highway 5A in the north of the country, which until now had for decades been a dirt road that took a week to traverse in the rainy season.@@@Now it takes only two hours.@@@It has led to an immediate reduction in the costs of the transportation and movement of goods and people, considerably improving the lives of the local communities and contributing to socioeconomic development in my country’s northern regions.@@@In the south of the country, we are starting work on state highway 13 and will soon do the same for highways 10 and 44 in the east, thereby facilitating access to Madagascar’s main granary.@@@In the north-west, state highway 31, which is currently under reconstruction, will be entirely restored, which will mean that we will have access to our second largest agricultural area.@@@In a few weeks we will be starting work on the country’s first major highway, which will link the capital to our largest port.@@@Once the work is completed, the journey will be shortened from 10 hours to only two and a half.@@@The demographic dividend is a variable that we have to include in our equation.@@@We must change the structure of our population.@@@Our current demographic growth is not commensurate with our economic growth.@@@In some areas, girls under the age of 18 are already mothers of families who on average have to care for between five and eight children.@@@It is therefore harder for them to feed and properly raise, care for and educate those children.@@@Our family planning programme, which has already been launched, is therefore a crucial part of our strategy for controlling our birth rate and transforming the current population from one that is dependent to one that is employed and economically productive.@@@Our demography in Madagascar will be an asset to our development and no longer an obstacle to it.@@@With regard to education, we have made great strides.@@@My Government has built more than 1,000 classrooms and has made huge investments in teaching tools and material.@@@We have set up school canteens.@@@We have published books and textbooks and distributed tablets so as to considerably improve the quality of education received by our children and young people.@@@Access to basic education has increased by 146 per cent and the school dropout rate has significantly decreased.@@@We have made education a national priority, and we reiterate our commitment to transforming and revitalizing schools and universities.@@@Last year, I had the opportunity to speak (A/76/ PV.6, p.7) about my country’s wish to finally see the implementation of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 (resolution 34/91) and 1980 (resolution 35/123), concerning the return and administration of the Indian Ocean lies Eparses or Nosy Malagasy to Madagascar.@@@We welcome the upcoming second meeting of the joint French-Malagasy commission on the subject, and based on those two resolutions, which confirm the legitimacy of our claim, we hope to have the support of the United Nations in finally reaching a fair, settled and peaceful solution.@@@During the pandemic, the sick needed oxygen to survive.@@@Many countries are currently still struggling
to breathe, thanks to the effects of successive crises.@@@They need the oxygen they require to breathe in the form of support, aid and assistance, which will help them tackle the challenges of socioeconomic recovery and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We must accelerate the pace of the implementation of new financing mechanisms, such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, to ensure the disbursement of funding.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to thank the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the friendly countries that have always stood with us in the most difficult times.@@@The Africa of tomorrow must be autonomous, independent and prosperous.@@@We have a duty to change the history of the continent and to write a new chapter so that each of us and each of our countries can change and be transformed.@@@Our Organization needs to strengthen its solidarity to provide shared solutions to our common problems.@@@May God bless each of our nations.@@@The homeland is sacred.@@@Allow me to begin by conveying to the President the warm greetings of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Ariel Henry, who had to cancel his participation in the general debate at the last minute because of the sociopolitical situation in the country.@@@I therefore have the honour to read out the address that he was to have made from this rostrum.@@@“I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh ordinary session.@@@I hope that, under his wise leadership, this year’s work will be a complete success.@@@I would also like to commend the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his dynamic leadership of the world Organization and his renewed
commitment to the cause of Haiti despite the many challenging problems and other conflicts that affect the world.@@@“I have the honour today to address this Assembly in the specific context of major challenges that our States repeatedly face, which we must constantly address and find appropriate solutions for the good of humankind.@@@The United Nations, whose mission is to preserve the ideals of international peace and security, is the proper forum in the context of multilateral diplomacy to deal with and overcome those challenges, in accordance with the principles of international law and the values enshrined in its Charter, while respecting the right to self-determination of peoples.@@@“Global peace and security are at risk.@@@I call on the parties to all the conflicts that are causing disruption and suffering to the citizens of the world to stop the fighting and find negotiated solutions to their differences.@@@There are too many victims, too much destruction, too many consequences for other countries and too much collateral damage.@@@It is imperative to return to respecting the common rules of international law and living together.@@@“The sharp rise in the cost of basic foodstuffs on the international market is weakening the economies of many countries, especially developing countries, and is pushing hundreds of millions of human beings around the world into instability and food insecurity.@@@The temptation is great for each country to try to monopolize the available resources to provide for its population.@@@We saw the results of such behaviour in the control over vaccines during the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@In these difficult times, the rule must be solidarity among peoples.@@@“My country, like many others in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and elsewhere, remains highly vulnerable to climate hazards, rising sea levels and increasingly violent and frequent natural disasters.@@@The passage of a single cyclone can wipe out the efforts of decades of hard work and investment.@@@My country has unfortunately experienced devastating earthquakes and cyclones.@@@That is a concern for the countries of the subregion.@@@Within the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we are looking at this issue.@@@“It is imperative, indeed urgent, for the international community to demonstrate imagination, selflessness and altruism to commit our planet and our respective countries to a new kind of international relationship.@@@We are all interdependent and the problems of one can quickly have immediate consequences for others.@@@For example, conflicts between two countries or too much poverty in others lead to major migratory movements that can destabilize several neighbouring countries, or even more distant ones.@@@“In that respect, the theme of the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, takes on its full meaning in the case of my country.@@@This is an opportunity for me to talk, from the rostrum at the United Nations, about the challenges facing Haiti in the context of an institutional crisis and to speak about my Government’s efforts and responses to address and overcome them.@@@“I am speaking at a time when my country is going through a multidimensional crisis, whose consequences threaten democracy and the very foundations of the rule of law.@@@It is a sociopolitical crisis, compounded by insecurity, which further exacerbates the country’s situation and undermines the State apparatus.@@@It remains a matter of great concern for my Government and for the international community.@@@“Haiti is at a crossroads — an extremely difficult, but decisive crossroads for its future.@@@My Government is faced with a rather complex equation that needs to be solved, and that requires the effective support of our partners.@@@My Government’s priorities are to restore security and public order without delay; reach a broader consensus around a political agreement among as many sectors as possible in the short term in order to achieve peaceful governance; create a climate conducive to the holding of general elections as soon as possible, with a view to returning power to elected representatives freely chosen by the Haitian people in order to restore democratic institutions; and address economic and social issues in order to improve the material living conditions of the vast majority of the population.@@@“On the question of security and the restoration of public order, I will not be telling anyone anything new by saying that the activities of armed gangs create a dangerous environment that is ruining the daily lives of the Haitian population.@@@That is an unacceptable situation, which has reached worrisome dimensions.@@@Clashes among rival gangs have resulted in a high number of victims among the population, forcing them to flee their homes to escape the terror of the bandits.@@@“In my capacity as Head of the Superior Council of the Haitian National Police, given the complexity of the situation, I took measures to render the police more effective and better prepared to deal with the insecurity.@@@I proceeded, within our means, to strengthen the operational capacities of the police institution and improve the working conditions of police officers.@@@The strengthening of police operations led to some good results, reducing violence by armed gangs, particularly in the metropolitan area.@@@However, much remains to be done to combat and eradicate that scourge.@@@“That was acknowledged in the Secretary- General’s most recent report (S/2022/481) on the activities of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH).@@@The report notes that the efforts of the Haitian National Police led to the arrest of several individuals suspected of being involved in kidnappings and murders.@@@The report also recognizes the limitations of the National Police and the lack of capacity and expertise of BINUH, in its current composition, in terms of the number of experts and degree of specialization, to deal with the unprecedented level of crime in the country.@@@“I want to reaffirm here my determination to put out of action those who want to perpetuate the chaos and prevent the normalization of the situation.@@@My Government, at great sacrifice, made available the necessary resources to provide the National Police with adequate means to effectively carry out its duties.@@@The delivery of armoured vehicles and equipment that it lacks is delayed.@@@I truly regret that the orders placed to better equip the National Police are so late in being delivered.@@@The National Police is capable of doing its job, but it needs strong support from our partners and appropriate training on the ground with the help of partners from the international community in order to put an end to such a situation.@@@“I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Security Council resolution 2645 (2022), which prohibits the transfer of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition to non-State actors and prevents their trafficking and use for illicit purposes.@@@“In addition, several Member States have pledged bilateral support to the Haitian National Police, including financial assistance.@@@To that end, a basket fund was set up to assist the National Police in combating gang violence.@@@I commend the Governments that already contributed to that fund, and we encourage other partners to do so.@@@We need their continued solidarity now more than ever.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our key international partners that made commitments at the various high-level meetings on security in Haiti.@@@I thank them openly on behalf of the Haitian people and Government.@@@“The circumstances of my accession to the leadership of my country required that I immediately engage in a dialogue with all sectors of Haitian society in order to build sufficient consensus around a political agreement for peaceful and effective governance during the interim period.@@@I am convinced that frank, sincere and inclusive dialogue remains the best formula for achieving a lasting solution to the current crisis.@@@“Despite the political differences that persist among the political actors, I continue to encourage dialogue.@@@Initiatives involving various segments of society are under way.@@@I hope to see all those efforts succeed in the near future.@@@They primarily concern the restoration of fully operational democratic institutions through free, transparent and inclusive elections, as well as an agreement on a collective approach to constitutional reform.@@@“With regard to the political dialogue already under way, Haiti is seeking international support to make the process more credible and build confidence among the actors concerned.@@@In that context, I fully support the efforts of the CARICOM and the International Organization of la Francophonie to provide their expertise and engage with us to resolve the crisis, with the discreet yet effective support of the United Nations.@@@The Organization, which has long and extensive experience on the ground in Haiti, must continue to support the political and electoral process, taking into account the realities on the ground and the need to give priority to national solutions.@@@“I have heard the public’s calls.@@@I have listened to the demands of my compatriots protesting the high cost of living.@@@It is a constitutional right to protest and make demands in a peaceful manner.@@@However, I strongly condemn the looting and vandalism, as well as the attacks on churches, schools, universities, hospitals, politicians, economic actors, diplomatic missions and international organizations.@@@I also condemn those who ordered, organized and financed it all.@@@Sooner or later, they will have to answer for their crimes — before history and justice.@@@“The actors in Haiti need to understand that politics must be done differently.@@@That is why I remain available and open to continuing the dialogue with all stakeholders in the country, so that together we can open the path to reconciliation in order to repair the torn social fabric and find a lasting solution to a crisis that is pulling the country towards the abyss.@@@Good governance goes hand in hand with the fight against corruption, smuggling and trafficking of all kinds.@@@My Government has taken steps in that direction.@@@Our budgetary discipline and sound management of public revenues recently led to the establishment of a staff-monitored programme in my country with the help of the International Monetary Fund.@@@“My Government’s major reform of its customs service is beginning to bear fruit and show results.@@@It has enabled us to enhance monitoring and carry out seizures of weapons, ammunition, counterfeit currency and drugs.@@@In the process, we have seen customs revenues double in record time.@@@Not everyone was happy with that strategy, and we have good reason to believe that the unrest and attempts at destabilization represent the retaliation of fraudsters, whose activity has been reduced considerably.@@@“The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime—a United Nations programme—has provided us with experts to assist in customs administration throughout the reform.@@@The Office needs more resources in order to be more effective, as well as to contribute to the modernization of our customs system and ensure the sustainability of the reforms under way.@@@“With regard to justice and human rights, my Government assumed office in a delicate political context, following the heinous and tragic assassination of President Moise on 7 July 2021.@@@Justice must be done to him, his family and the Haitian people.@@@I would like to acknowledge the words of President Gustavo Petro Urrego of Colombia who, not long after his address to the General Assembly from this very rostrum (see A/77/PV.4), apologized to the Haitian people for the involvement of Colombian mercenaries in the murder of President Moise.@@@That is a transnational crime involving the nationals of several countries.@@@Investigating it is difficult and complex.@@@I want to thank all the countries involved for their cooperation.@@@“Many other crimes and massacres have to date gone unpunished, and murderers are still at large, some of whom have had the audacity to place themselves, weapons in hand, at the head of demonstrations over the past few days.@@@I am also aware of cases of human rights violations against peaceful Haitian citizens, a direct consequence of the climate of insecurity that prevails in the country.@@@Respect for human dignity is the foundation of the fundamental rights of every individual.@@@I am determined to respect, and ensure respect for, international and regional commitments aimed at preserving human rights.@@@“In that regard, working to end prolonged pretrial detentions, which is a situation to which many detainees awaiting trial are subjected, remains a priority.@@@The fact that it occurs reflects the weakness of our judicial system, which must be reformed.@@@In that regard, I commend the efforts of civil society actors and the personnel of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, which continue to promote and contribute to the improved administration of justice in the country.@@@“Contrary to what some of my opponents have said, I have no desire to stay in power for longer than necessary.@@@My Government’s main focus is to re-establish constitutional order and return the leadership of the country to elected officials who are freely chosen by the Haitian people through free, transparent and inclusive elections.@@@I continue to encourage dialogue aimed at reaching a political agreement on the holding of free presidential, legislative and local elections as soon as the minimum conditions are established.@@@“It is essential that the elections be held in a climate of security and social calm.@@@That is an essential condition for ensuring the broadest possible participation of people of a voting age, which is the only way to guarantee the legitimacy of newly elected officials and ensure political stability.@@@I have begun discussions with the various stakeholders on the establishment of the body responsible for organizing the elections, and those discussions should be concluded shortly.@@@That body must be able to quickly prepare a timetable for political actors on both the constitutional referendum and the holding of elections.@@@We would greatly appreciate the technical support and expertise of our usual partners in that process, while of course respecting the freedom and sovereignty of Haitians.@@@“With regard to economic and social issues, I often say that poverty, precariousness and the lack of future prospects for our young people, inter alia, are the root causes of the repeated crises my country is experiencing.@@@It is important that, even in the short time in which my Government has been called upon to assume such responsibilities, we address economic and social issues in order to improve Haitians’ material conditions of existence.@@@A sustainable solution to the phenomenon of insecurity also requires long-term socioeconomic development.@@@There is a direct relationship between the level of crime and the situation of extreme poverty.@@@“We must also give hope to our young people by creating stable and decent job opportunities so as to offer them alternatives to plan and build their futures without being forced to risk illegal and clandestine travel.@@@Safe and legal migration can be beneficial to countries’ economic development, as stated in the Declaration on Migration and Protection, to which 20 Governments of the region, including Haiti, subscribed on 10 June at the ninth Summit of the Americas.@@@“In addition to the sociopolitical crisis and the phenomenon of insecurity, natural disasters are a major handicap to Haiti’s development.@@@The most recent earthquake on 14 August 2021 dealt another blow to the national economy.@@@The economy’s poor performance for three consecutive years exposed the country to a serious humanitarian crisis.@@@“There are 4.9 million people, or 46 per cent of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance this year.@@@With the support of our partners, the Government has been able to assist over 450,000 people in three earthquake-affected areas.@@@Damage and losses caused by the earthquake have been estimated at more than 11 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.@@@We hope that the promises made by our partners at the international donors’ conference held under the auspices of the United Nations and the Haitian Government in Port-au- Prince in February will be fulfilled.@@@“Insecurity, political instability and natural disasters have contributed greatly to the poor performance of the country’s economy, which has experienced negative growth for three consecutive years.@@@This non-exhaustive summary of the situation explains the deterioration of the living conditions of the majority of the population, whose social and economic rights are constantly being violated.@@@The Haitian population, especially the vast majority who live in precarious conditions, has the right to a decent life.@@@“It is true that humanitarian aid has never contributed to a country’s development.@@@We must create the conditions to attract investment.@@@It is the responsibility of my Government to work to improve the situation — we are well aware of that fact, and we are working on it.@@@“Haiti is at a crossroads, a decisive moment in its history.@@@We are working on transformative solutions to the challenges we face.@@@From this rostrum, I wish to join President Biden, who has a solid understanding of the Haitian crisis, in making a solemn appeal to the international community to stand with Haiti and the Haitian people.@@@I also wish to thank all those Heads of State and Government of our great family of nations who have expressed their concern about the situation in my country and have offered Haiti their support.@@@Much remains to be done to emerge from the crisis and move towards the social and economic progress to which the Haitian people aspire.”@@@It is an honour for me to speak before the Assembly on behalf of France.@@@At this point in time, I am thinking of those who have fought in my country and everywhere in the world for France to be free.@@@I am also thinking of those for whom, in the past, the fate of Europe was a matter of concern, whether they came from Africa, Asia, Oceania or America, because a part of their freedom and the future of the world was at stake.@@@I am thinking of those who wrote our Charter and built the walls of the Organization to avert the worst, which occurred twice in the twentieth century, bringing untold sorrow to all of humankind.@@@Let us never forget that debt.@@@It serves the interests of all our countries and indicates the path to peace.@@@It reminds us that there is no other legitimate or lasting centre of power than that where the nations come together to make decisions sovereignly.@@@It tells us that the universality of our Organization serves no hegemony or geopolitical oligarchy.@@@Yet, this legacy, our Organization, along with our choices as nations, are today facing a choice.@@@We have one simple choice to make today, and that is the choice between war and peace.@@@On 24 February, Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, fractured our collective security with an act of aggression, invasion and annexation.@@@It deliberately violated the Charter of the United Nations and the principle of the sovereign equality of States.@@@On 16 March, the International Court of Justice stated that Russia’s aggression was illegal and demanded that Russia withdraw.@@@Russia decided, with that action, to pave the way for other wars of annexation, today in Europe, but perhaps tomorrow in Asia, Africa or Latin America.@@@We may say whatever we like today.@@@I have heard a number of discussions and a number of statements.@@@However, I am certain of one thing.@@@Right now, as I speak, there are Russian troops in Ukraine and, to my knowledge, there are no Ukrainian troops in Russia.@@@That is an irrefutable fact that we must all accept.@@@The longer this war lasts, the more it threatens peace in Europe and peace in the world.@@@It will lead us towards broader, enduring conflict, where everyone’s sovereignty and security will be determined solely by power struggles, the size of armies, the solidity of alliances and the intentions of armed groups and militias, and where those who see themselves as strong seek to subjugate those they consider to be weak, using all possible means.@@@What we have been witnessing since 24 February is a return to the age of imperialism and colonies.@@@France refuses to accept that and will determinedly seek peace.@@@In that regard, our position is clear, and it is in supporting this position that I have pursued dialogue with Russia — even before war broke out —throughout these past months.@@@And I will continue to do so because that is how we will seek peace together.@@@We are seeking peace through initiatives undertaken in the years and months prior to the conflict in order to avert it.@@@We have been seeking peace since 24 February through the humanitarian, economic and military support that we
have provided the Ukrainian people to exercise their legitimate right to self-defence and safeguard their freedom.@@@We have been seeking peace through our condemnation of the invasion of a sovereign State, the violation of the principles of our collective security, and the war crimes committed by Russia on Ukrainian soil, and through our rejection of impunity.@@@The international justice system should establish the crimes and try the perpetrators.@@@We are seeking peace, lastly, through our will to curb the geographic spread and intensity of the war.@@@It is up to us in that regard to support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent the war’s consequences for nuclear safety and security, as we will do in the future alongside Ukrainians whose sovereignty over their plants is not up for discussion.@@@We managed to have an Agency mission visit the plant and draw up a report independently.@@@Let us work together to prevent the risk of an accident that would have devastating consequences.@@@All of us here today know that peace can be restored only with an agreement that complies with international law.@@@Negotiations will be possible only if, sovereignly, Ukraine wants them and Russia agrees to them in good faith.@@@We all know too that negotiations will be successful only if Ukraine’s sovereignty is respected, its territory liberated and its security protected.@@@Russia now needs to understand that it cannot impose its will through military means, even by cynically accompanying them with sham referendums in the territories that have been bombarded and now occupied.@@@It is up to the members of the Security Council to state that loud and clear, and to the members of the Assembly to support us on this path to peace.@@@From this rostrum, I call on the States Members of the United Nations to take action to persuade Russia to renounce its choice of war, assess the cost for itself and all of us and end its aggression.@@@It is not a question of taking sides between the East or the West or between the North or South.@@@We are talking about the responsibility of all those who are committed to respect for the Charter and to our most precious good — peace — because beyond war, there is a risk of global division due to the direct and indirect consequences of the conflict.@@@I know that many here in the Assembly are harbouring a sense of injustice with regard to the dire energy, food and economic consequences of Russia’s war.@@@I also know that some countries represented here have remained neutral with regard to this war.@@@I want to say to tell them as clearly as possible today that those who wish to take up the cause of the non-aligned by refusing to express themselves clearly are mistaken and bear a historic responsibility.@@@The cause of the non-aligned used to be a cause for peace.@@@The cause of the non-aligned used to be on behalf of the sovereignty of States and for the territorial integrity of each of them.@@@That is what the cause of the non-aligned used to be.@@@Those who remain silent today, in spite of themselves — or secretly with a degree of complicity — further the cause of a new imperialism, of a modern cynicism that breaks up our international order, without which peace is not possible.@@@Russia is working to implant the idea today of a double standard, but the war in Ukraine should not be a conflict that leaves anyone feeling indifferent.@@@It is close to Europeans who have chosen to support Ukraine without entering into war with Russia.@@@It feels farther away for many States represented here, but we have all felt the direct consequences of it and we all have a role to play to end this war because we are all paying its price.@@@Because of its very foundations, this war launched by Russia flouts the principles at the heart of our Organization.@@@It flouts the principles of the only international order possible, the only order that can guarantee peace — respect for national sovereignty and the inviolability of borders.@@@In that regard, let us not conflate causes and consequences.@@@Who here can defend the idea that the invasion of Ukraine does not warrant punishment?@@@Who here could consider that, on the day on which something similar is done to them by a more powerful neighbour, the silence of the region and the world would be the best response?@@@Who can support that?@@@Who can believe that it would suffice for Russia to win this war so that we could move on to something else?@@@Nobody.@@@Contemporary imperialism is not European or Western.@@@It takes the form of a territorial invasion backed by a globalized hybrid war that uses energy prices, food security, nuclear safety, access to information and movements of people as weapons to divide and destroy.@@@That is how this war is undermining the sovereignty of us all.@@@France will therefore stand with the free peoples of the United Nations to address the consequences of the conflict and all the inequalities that it is exacerbating by challenging bloc geopolitics and exclusive alliances because, beyond the direct consequences of the war, the risk we are now facing is that of a new partitioning of the world.@@@Some would have us believe that there is the
West on one side that will defend outmoded values to serve its interests, and that on the other side there is the rest of the world that has suffered so much and seeks to cooperate by supporting the war or by looking the other way.@@@I object to that division for at least two reasons.@@@The first is a question of principle, as I mentioned earlier.@@@Our Organization champions universal values.@@@Let us not allow the mistaken idea to take hold that there is something regional or adaptable in the values of the Charter.@@@Our Organization has universal values and the division in the face of the war in Ukraine is simple.@@@Are members for or against the law of the strongest, non-respect for the territorial integrity of countries and national sovereignty?@@@Are members for or against impunity?@@@I cannot imagine any international order or lasting peace that is not based on respect for peoples and the principle of responsibility.@@@Therefore, yes, our values are universal and that is why they can never serve a Power that violates these principles.@@@And when we have taken liberties with these same values in recent years, we have been wrong to do so, but that cannot under any circumstances justify trampling on what we collectively built after the Second World War.@@@I hear Russia say that it is ready to work on new cooperation and a new international order, without hegemony.@@@That is great, but on what principles is that new order based?@@@Invading a neighbour?@@@Not respecting borders of those I do not like?@@@What is that order?@@@Who is hegemonic today if not Russia?@@@What is being proposed to us?@@@What is being sold to us?@@@What dream is being sold on the good faith of some of us here today?@@@Nothing that lasts for long.@@@Let us not give into the cynicism that is breaking up the order that we have built and that alone has enabled us to maintain international stability.@@@These values — respect for national sovereignty, the integrity of borders — are our values.@@@I reiterate that we were wrong every time we took liberties with them, but they are the values that we built after the Second World War, after colonialism.@@@Let us refuse to have history falter under the pretext that today it is other geographic regions that are affected.@@@Let us not give in.@@@The second reason I object to this attempt to partition the world is pragmatic.@@@Behind the emerging divisions, there is an attempt to partition the world in a way that ramps up tension between the United States and China.@@@I believe this is a disastrous mistake for us all because it would not be a new Cold War.@@@Several powers of disorder and imbalance are taking advantage of this period to multiply regional conflicts, return to the path of nuclear proliferation and reduce collective security.@@@I therefore believe that we must do everything we can to ensure that this new division does not happen because our challenges are growing in number and urgency and require new cooperation.@@@Let us look at Pakistan.@@@A third of the country has been flooded.@@@There are more than 1,400 dead, 1,300 injured and millions of people in emergency situations.@@@Let us look at the Horn of Africa.@@@It is experiencing the worst drought in 40 years and a rainy season that will probably be worse still.@@@Half of humankind now lives in a climate danger zone.@@@Our ecosystems are reaching the point of no return.@@@Let us look at Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan.@@@Famine is returning.@@@The food crisis is affecting everywhere, and the most vulnerable are hardest hit.@@@Around the world, 345 million people, including 153 million children, are experiencing acute hunger.@@@There are currently 55 civil wars being waged on our planet.@@@There are 100 million displaced persons.@@@While between 1990 and 2015, 137,000 people escaped extreme poverty every day, by 2030 some 345 million in conflict-affected countries could slip back into it.@@@The most vulnerable people are always the hardest hit by crises, climate disruption, pandemics and rising food prices.@@@These threats are all still present, while in addition terrorism, among other areas, is affecting the Sahel and the Middle East.@@@There is nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea, which we have not managed to curb.@@@These are the emergencies facing us.@@@As time is short, the description I have just given is not exhaustive, but these emergencies are each either the result of deep-rooted flaws in our international system, which was able to reap the benefits of globalization but failed to contain its divisions, threats and imbalances, or the result of divisions among us.@@@Our shared responsibility is to work to help the most vulnerable, those most affected by all these challenges.@@@As Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, rightly said, now is not the time for war.@@@Nor is it time for revenge on the West, or for Western opposition to the rest of the world.@@@It is time for sovereign, equal countries to work together on today’s challenges.@@@That is why we must urgently create a new contract between North and South, an effective, respectful contract on food, climate and biodiversity, and education.@@@The time for bloc thinking has passed.@@@It is now time to build specific action coalitions and reconcile legitimate interests and the common good.@@@To address the global food crisis, France has doubled its contributions to the World Food Programme.@@@Along with the European Union, we established solidarity corridors that enabled the export by land of more than 10 million tons of grain since spring.@@@The agreement brokered on 22 July complemented those efforts, thanks to the work of the Secretary-General, which led to the export of 2.4 million tons of grain through the Black Sea, a process that is ongoing.@@@We launched the Food and Agricultural Resilience Mission initiative, which allows us to provide vulnerable countries with food at low prices, without political conditions, and to invest in agriculture in countries that would like to be self-sufficient.@@@I would also like to announce that France will fund the export of Ukrainian wheat to Somalia, in partnership with the World Food Programme.@@@We will do so with solidarity, efficiency and the required full transparency.@@@Tomorrow we will meet with the African Union, United Nations agencies, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Commission to develop a mechanism that can ensure access to fertilizer for Africa, in support of the Secretary-General’s initiatives in that regard.@@@With regard to climate and biodiversity, in a few weeks we will meet in Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Let us be clear here about what a just transition means.@@@Our first collective fight is to eliminate coal.@@@The crisis must not make us lose sight of that goal.@@@Otherwise, we will exceed the predictions of a 2°C global temperature increase.@@@I am prepared to invest in funding coalitions, as we did with South Africa a few months ago.@@@We must continue along that path.@@@However, China and the large emerging Powers must make a clear decision at COP.@@@It is crucial.@@@Together with the large emerging Powers, we must build coalitions with State actors and our international financial institutions to develop comprehensive energy production solutions and effect changes to industrial production models, which alone can bring about that transition.@@@The Group of Seven must lead by example.@@@The richest countries must accelerate their carbon neutrality programmes and must also make the effort to show restraint and share green technologies.@@@Members know that they can count on the European Union in that area.@@@I also believe that we must acknowledge that it is challenging for the poorest countries to take simultaneous steps to fight poverty and accelerate the transition.@@@We cannot ask the same of both sub-Saharan Africa, where 100 million people remain without access to electricity, and the largest emitters.@@@That is why the richest countries must strengthen their financial and technological solidarity with the poorest countries on climate issues.@@@We must provide funding and solutions and accelerate that agenda, as we were able to do during the pandemic, and we must do in a more forceful, effective and determined manner.@@@In that context, together we must also protect our carbon pricing and biodiversity.@@@Together with Costa Rica, France will host the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference.@@@Let us make it the COP21 for oceans.@@@With regard to health, we must learn from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@We must recognize that health systems and personnel are our first line of defence in the most vulnerable countries.@@@I will underscore that crucial point during the seventh Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which France remains one of the principal contributors.@@@We must also ensure that the World Health Organization establishes early-warning systems to prevent the spread of other viruses.@@@We must address human and animal health together.@@@That is the key objective of the One Health Initiative, led by France, in coordination with several other countries.@@@As with the Global Partnership for Education, we must continue our efforts so that children can attend school after the pandemic prevented them from doing so.@@@It means addressing the root of the problem, combating all inequalities and working towards our common future.@@@As members can see, more cooperation and partnerships among stakeholders in the North and the South must be developed in all areas.@@@Greater commitment is needed from our major institutions.@@@All of that is the opposite of division.@@@Who was there during the pandemic?@@@Who proposed funding for the climate transition?@@@It is not those who now propose a new international order but had no vaccines that worked.@@@It is not those who did not show solidarity and contributed nothing to help mitigate climate issues.@@@Those are the challenges that affect us all.@@@We must demonstrate greater solidarity and engage in more cooperation, but
under no circumstances should we yield to siren calls that lead nowhere.@@@To that end, we must also be clear about the situation in the poorest countries and the middle-income countries — whether in Africa, South America, Asia or the Pacific.@@@The pandemic has increased inequalities.@@@The war and its consequences have increased the number of challenges for several countries.@@@The Group of 20 (G-20) must therefore absolutely adhere to last year’s goal to mobilize $100 billion from special drawing rights, but we must do more, above all with respect to the IMF’s special drawing rights allocations.@@@We must honour our commitments.@@@Several countries, in particular in Africa, have not yet seen that money.@@@We cannot tell them that it is being held up by a Parliament or being prevented by some rule.@@@That cannot happen.@@@It will be too late.@@@We must do more because the challenges are even greater.@@@We must increase our special drawing rights allocation to 30 per cent for the most vulnerable African countries and the poorest countries in the world.@@@Along with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we must recommit our mechanisms, which are no longer adapted to the current context.@@@The rules in use today are those from the 1980s.@@@The situation in our post-COVID-19 world — increased climate deregulation, the loss of biodiversity, imbalances created by the war — call for greater solidarity.@@@We need a new financial compact with the South.@@@That is where we must act.@@@That is what should bring us together, not to fight a common enemy or to refute false narratives or historical revisionism, but to protect the planet on which we all live and for equal opportunities for all.@@@The fight is our fight.@@@It brings us all together.@@@We simply need to make a little more effort to adhere to our agreements and respect one another.@@@This is the true fight.@@@If we are not able to fight together, it will be the cause of all division and conflicts in the future.@@@I invite all those who wish to build that new compact with us to the Paris Peace Forum, which will be held on 11 November, ahead of the G-20 meeting to be held in Bali.@@@I invite them to move forward with us without relinquishing our common values and guiding principles.@@@We must focus on essential matters and not give in to the world’s divisions or increased threats to peace.@@@We must not allow the number of crises, including those that cannot be resolved, to increase.@@@We cannot allow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.@@@Those are all risks that we will not be able to manage in the future without involving the major Powers most directly concerned.@@@It is precisely that effort to involve the major regional Powers that must be made in the Middle East, via a follow-up to the 2021 Baghdad conference, in order to ensure stability in Iraq, Lebanon and the entire region.@@@The five permanent members of the Security Council are no longer the only ones with something to say, and if they have something to say it is clear.@@@That can work only if we are able to work more broadly to achieve the international consensus that is so necessary for peace.@@@That is why I hope that we can commit at last to reform of the Security Council so that it is more representative, welcomes new permanent members and
remains able to fully play its role by restricting the use of the right to the veto in cases of mass atrocities.@@@Together, we must build peace and contemporary international order to achieve the goals of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@On that path, the United Nations can count fully on France.@@@On that path, each country represented here can count on France.@@@I heartily congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session.@@@I assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation throughout the session.@@@I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid.@@@I would like to express my deep appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his strong commitment to making the United Nations more vibrant in its responsibilities.@@@The theme of this year’s general debate is “A watershed moment:	transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.@@@Our planet Earth today is plagued by multiple complex and multidimensional challenges, such as climate change, violence and conflict, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@This year’s theme calls for united efforts to find ways to overcome those challenges and revitalize our economy to build a peaceful and sustainable world.@@@To achieve that goal, we need to act collectively without delay.@@@We believe that antagonism, like war, economic sanctions and counter-sanctions can never bring good to any nation.@@@Mutual dialogue is the best way to resolve crises and disputes.@@@In that context, I thank the Secretary-General for setting up the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.@@@As a champion of the Group, I am working with other world leaders to identify a global solution commensurate with the gravity and depth of the current situation.@@@The father of the nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, formulated our foreign policy dictum “friendship to all, malice towards none”.@@@Bangladesh has been pursuing that principle of non-alignment since its independence.@@@In his maiden address to the Assembly on 25 September 1974, he said:
“Our total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only an environment of peace would enable us to enjoy the fruits of our hard- won national independence and to mobilize and concentrate all our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment.@@@“We therefore welcome every effort aimed at advancing the process of detente, relaxation of tension, limitation of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of the world, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe or Latin America.”@@@(A/PV.2243, p.160)
That statement of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib is still equally relevant in the present global context.@@@Bangabandhu believed that peace is the embodiment of the aspirations of all men and women in the world.@@@As a result of war, human beings, especially women and children, suffer tremendously.@@@Many people become refugees.@@@Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have adopted strategies to contain the crisis, mainly focusing on three aspects.@@@First, we expanded national health care to prevent the transmission and spread of the infection.@@@Secondly, we have provided strategic fiscal stimulus to safeguard our economy.@@@Thirdly, we have secured people’s livelihoods.@@@Those initiatives have helped reduce the number of deaths due to the pandemic as well as reduce public sufferings.@@@Vaccination is the key to our safe transition from the pandemic.@@@We thank the World Health Organization and its COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) system and our partner countries for providing this vaccine.@@@As of August, 100 per cent of the eligible population of Bangladesh had been vaccinated.@@@We are working towards sustainable economic growth, creating equal opportunities for all and realizing an inclusive peaceful society and social harmony.@@@Bangladesh is now one of the five fastest growing economies in the world.@@@We are forty-first in terms of gross domestic product (GDP).@@@We have reduced the poverty rate from 41 per cent to 20.5 per cent over the past decade.@@@Our per capita income has tripled to $2,824 in just one decade.@@@Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, our GDP growth rate in fiscal year 2018-2019 was 8.15 per cent.@@@Earlier, we achieved GDP growth of over 7 per cent for three consecutive years.@@@Even during the pandemic, the economy of Bangladesh expanded by 6.94 per cent in the fiscal year 2020-2021.@@@However, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, economic sanctions and counter-sanctions, there has been a supply chain disruption and exorbitant price hikes for fuel, food and consumer goods.@@@That has put economies like ours under tremendous pressure.@@@Inflation has been increased.@@@We are taking various initiatives to overcome this situation.@@@In 2026, Bangladesh is going to graduate from least developed countries category to that of developing country.@@@We are working to transform Bangladesh into a knowledge-based developed country by 2041 and building a prosperous and climate-resilient delta by 2100.@@@Bangladesh has achieved significant progress in universal primary education, food security, the reduction of maternal and child mortality, gender equality, women’s empowerment and so on.@@@The literacy rate has increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in the past decade.@@@We have placed great emphasis on ensuring an information technology-based education system.@@@Our infant mortality rate has declined to 21 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal mortality rate has decreased to 173 per 100,000 live births.@@@The average life expectancy of our people is now more than 73 years.@@@We have paid special attention to the most vulnerable people in society so that no one is left behind.@@@The coverage of the existing social safety net has been expanded to ensure the social and financial security of destitute women, widows, the elderly, persons with disabilities, third gender people and other vulnerable segments of society.@@@Currently, about 10.7 million people are receiving direct benefits under the social safety net.@@@Improved physical infrastructure serves as the foundation for a strong economic structure.@@@That is why we are building massive sustainable infrastructure, including underwater tunnels, elevated expressways and mass rapid transit systems.@@@Recently, we have added the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, a self-funded asset, to our road communications system.@@@It will facilitate Bangladesh’s local and international trade and enhance regional connectivity.@@@That will ensure at least 1.23 per cent growth in our national income.@@@The impact of climate change is one of the biggest threats to humankind.@@@In the past, we have seen a vicious cycle of promises being made and broken.@@@We must now change this course.@@@In Bangladesh, we have led many transformative measures to tackle the perilous impacts of climate change, consistent with the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@During our presidency of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, we launched the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, which is aimed at putting Bangladesh on a sustainable trajectory from vulnerability to resilience and climate prosperity.@@@Our national plans and policies on climate change and natural disaster have been made gender sensitive.@@@We are ready to support other vulnerable countries to develop their own prosperity plans.@@@I call on world leaders to promote inclusive climate actions.@@@Migrants continue to face precarious situations in their migration journeys and are denied their rights.@@@To overcome that situation, we must enhance global partnership and solidarity.@@@The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and its Progress Declaration give us an excellent road map in that regard.@@@Today complex global crises have reversed decades of development gains of many developing countries.@@@The realization of the 2030 Agenda appears to be a farfetched dream for many of them at this moment.@@@They need targeted support in areas that are severely impacted, including health, education, decent jobs and agriculture.@@@There is no better way than harnessing the potentials of science, technology and innovation.@@@We are witnessing how frontier technologies are rapidly changing the world.@@@It is imperative that everyone, everywhere gets fair and equal access to these technologies.@@@The burgeoning digital divide must be bridged.@@@Sixteen countries, including Bangladesh, are now on track to graduate from the list of least developed countries.@@@However, the evolving global crises have posed serious challenges to our sustainable graduation.@@@We appeal to development partners for enhanced and tailored support.@@@We welcome the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries in that regard.@@@After the peaceful settlement of maritime boundary issues with neighbouring countries, the blue economy has opened a new horizon for the development of Bangladesh.@@@We are committed to working with global partners for the sustainable use, conservation and management of our marine resources to accelerate our socioeconomic development.@@@The effective implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is imperative to harnessing sustainable utilization of ocean resources.@@@In that regard, I also call upon Member States to work closely to bridge the gaps and conclude the much- needed international instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.@@@We are fully committed to complete disarmament, including the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.@@@We ratified the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2019.@@@We have consistently implemented our commitment to peacekeeping operations.@@@As a reflection of our peace-centric foreign policy, we are the largest contributor of troops and police to United Nations peacekeeping missions.@@@They help maintain peace, support the capacity-building of national and local institutions, protect civilians from harm, empower women and other vulnerable communities and build a sustainable society.@@@While performing those duties, many of them have sacrificed their lives.@@@We believe that we cannot sustain peace without addressing the root causes of conflict.@@@As the current Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, we are doing our part by creating a platform for multi-stakeholder engagement in support of the conflict-affected countries.@@@We are committed to pursuing our efforts to strengthen the women and peace and security agenda.@@@We have adopted a zero-tolerance policy on terrorism and violent extremism.@@@We do not allow our territory to be used by any party to incite or cause terrorist acts or harm to others.@@@I also call on Member States to work together for the conclusion of an internationally binding instrument to tackle cybercrime and cyberviolence.@@@As a responsible Member Sate, Bangladesh is fully committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of its own people.@@@We have adopted a holistic and inclusive approach to ensuring the political, economic, cultural and social rights of the people.@@@For example, we have adopted legal provisions to ensure the rights and welfare of third-gender individuals.@@@We have been implementing the Ashrayan project to provide free housing to all homeless and landless families in the country.@@@Since 1997 and for 18 years during the tenure of my Government, we have provided housing to more than 3.5 million people.@@@We believe that continued democratic polity and norms can ensure people’s socioeconomic emancipation.@@@We will continue to extend our support to the Palestinian people.@@@I reiterate Bangladesh’s unequivocal support for the two-State solution, based on the pre-1967 borders and the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@I shall now turn to the Rohingya people forcibly displaced from Myanmar.@@@Last month marked five years since the 2017 start of the mass exodus of the Rohingyas to Bangladesh from their home country.@@@Despite our bilateral engagements with Myanmar, trilateral discussions with partners and engagements with the United Nations and Member States, not a single Rohingya has been repatriated to her or his ancestral home in Myanmar.@@@The ongoing political turmoil and armed conflicts in the country have made the repatriation of the displaced Rohingyas even more difficult.@@@I hope the United Nations will play an effective role in that regard.@@@The prolonged presence of the Rohingya in Bangladesh has had serious repercussions on our economy, environment, security and sociopolitical stability.@@@Uncertainty over repatriation has led to widespread frustration.@@@Cross-
border organized crime, including human and drug trafficking, is on the rise.@@@This situation can even potentially fuel radicalization.@@@If the problem persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region and beyond.@@@The greatest lesson we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that no one is safe until everyone is safe.@@@We must use the hard-earned lessons to stimulate the critical and much-needed reforms of our institutions, including of the United Nations, to better prepare for such calamities in the future.@@@We are interested in looking for transformative solutions to alleviate poverty, mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, and prevent conflicts and the economic, energy and fuel crises that the world is grappling with now.@@@However, we need to understand the fact that socioeconomic development cannot be achieved without ensuring peace and stability.@@@We want to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.@@@Due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, all humankind, including women and children, is being punished.@@@The war’s impact is not confined to one country; rather, it puts the lives and livelihoods of the people of all nations at greater risk and infringes their human rights.@@@People are deprived of food, shelter, health care and education.@@@Children suffer the most in particular.@@@Their future sinks into darkness.@@@I appeal to the conscience of the world to stop the arms race, war and sanctions; ensure food, education, health care and the security of the children; and establish peace.@@@We want to see a peaceful world with enhanced cooperation and solidarity, shared prosperity and collective actions.@@@We share one planet, and we owe it to our future generations to leave it in a better shape.@@@I would like to talk about a cruel tragedy now.@@@On 15 August 1975, my father, the father of the nation, the incumbent President of Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was brutally assassinated, along with my mother Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, my three younger brothers, Freedom Fighter Captain Sheikh Kamal and his newly married wife Sultana, Freedom Fighter Lieutenant Sheikh Jamal and his newly married wife Parveen Rosy, and Sheikh Russell, who was just 10 years old.@@@A total of 18 of my family members were killed, including my paternal uncle Freedom Fighter Sheikh Abu Naser, paternal uncle Abdur Rab Serniabat, his 13-year-old daughter Baby Serniabat, 10-year-old son Arif Serniabat and 4-year-old son Shukanto, my paternal cousin Freedom Fighter Sheikh Mani and his pregnant wife Arzu Mani, Brigadier Jamil, and police officer Siddiqur Rahman.@@@May their souls rest in peace.@@@My younger sister, Sheikh Rehana and myself survived the brutality on 15 August 1975, as we were in Germany at that time.@@@After that, we spent six years abroad as refugees.@@@In 1971, when the liberation war going on, the Pakistan occupation forces killed 3 million innocent Bengalis.@@@Two hundred thousand women were heinously tortured and abused.@@@I recall their sacrifices with deep homage.@@@After my father was arrested in 1971, he was taken to an undisclosed location in Pakistan.@@@In Dhaka, my mother, my younger brothers Sheikh Russell and Sheikh Jamal, younger sister Sheikh Rehana and I were arrested, too, and were kept in a damp one-story house.@@@My first child, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, was born in that prison house.@@@There was no furniture in that house.@@@There were no medical facilities or provisions.@@@Even getting daily food was uncertain.@@@Having suffered these things myself, I can rightly realize the pain and agony that people endure due to the horrors of war, killings, coups and conflict.@@@I therefore do not want war.@@@I want peace.@@@I want welfare for humankind.@@@I want economic development for people.@@@I want to ensure a peaceful world, and a developed and prosperous life for future generations.@@@My earnest appeal to Member States is to stop war and the arms race.@@@May the values of humankind be upheld.@@@Let us join our hands together and build a better future, leaving no one behind, so that our future generations may live in a peaceful world.@@@Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu.@@@May Bangladesh live forever.@@@At the time of its foundation, the United Nations was a beacon of promise.@@@In the aftermath of the Second World War, the building we are in symbolized the end of aggression.@@@For many decades, the United Nations has helped to deliver stability and security in much of the world.@@@It has provided a place for nations to work together on shared challenges, and it has promoted the principles of sovereignty and self-determination even through the Cold War and its aftermath.@@@But today those principles, which have defined our lives since the dark days of the 1940s, are fracturing.@@@For the first time in the history of the General Assembly, we are meeting during a large-scale war of aggression in Europe, and authoritarian States are undermining stability and security around the world.@@@Geopolitics is entering a new era that requires those who believe in the founding
principles of the United Nations to stand up and be counted.@@@In the United Kingdom, we are entering a new era too.@@@I am joining everyone here just two days after Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest.@@@We deeply mourn her passing, and we pay tribute to her service.@@@She was the rock on which modern Britain was built, and she symbolized the post-war values on which the Organization was founded.@@@Our constitutional monarchy, underpinned by a democratic society, has delivered stability and progress.@@@Her late Majesty transcended differences and healed division.@@@We saw that in her visits to post-apartheid South Africa and the Republic of Ireland.@@@When she addressed this General Assembly 65 years ago (see A/PV.707), she warned that it was vital not only to have strong ideals but also the political will to deliver on them.@@@Now we must show that will.@@@We must fight to defend those ideals.@@@And we must deliver on them for all our peoples.@@@As we say farewell to our late Queen, the United Kingdom opens a new chapter — a new Carolean age — under His Majesty King Charles III.@@@We want this era to be one of hope and progress; one in which we defend the values of individual liberty, self-determination and equality before the law; one in which we ensure that freedom and democracy prevail for all people; and one in which we deliver on the commitments that our late Queen made here 65 years ago.@@@This is about what we do in the United Kingdom and what we do as States Members of the United Nations.@@@I will therefore set out today the steps we are taking at home in the United Kingdom, our proposed blueprint for the new era we are now in and the new partnerships and instruments that we should collectively adopt.@@@Our commitment to hope and progress must begin at home, in the lives of each and every citizen whom we serve.@@@Our strength as a nation comes from the strong foundations of freedom and democracy.@@@Democracy gives people the right to choose their own path, and it evolves to reflect the aspirations of citizens.@@@It unleashes enterprise, ideas and opportunity.@@@It protects the freedoms that are at the very core of our humanity.@@@By contrast, autocracies sow the seeds of their own demise by suppressing their citizens.@@@They are fundamentally rigid and unable to adapt.@@@Any short-term gains are eroded in the long term because such societies stifle the aspiration and creativity that are vital to long-term growth.@@@A country where artificial intelligence acts as judge and jury and where there are no human rights and no fundamental freedoms is not the kind of place where anyone truly wants to live, and it is not the kind of world we want to build.@@@But we cannot simply assume there will be a democratic future.@@@There is a real struggle going on between different forms of society, between democracies and autocracies.@@@Unless democratic societies deliver on the economy and security that our citizens expect, we will fall behind.@@@We need to keep improving and renewing what we are doing for this new era, demonstrating that democracy delivers.@@@As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I am determined that we will deliver the progress that people expect.@@@I will lead a new Britain for a new era.@@@First, that begins with growth and building a British economy that rewards enterprise and attracts investment.@@@Our long-term aim is to get our economy growing at an average of 2.5 per cent.@@@We need that growth to deliver investment around our country, the jobs and high wages that people expect and public services like the National Health Service.@@@We want people to keep more of the money they earn so that they can have more control over their own lives and can contribute to the future.@@@Secondly, it means securing affordable and reliable energy supplies.@@@We are cutting off the toxic power and pipelines from authoritarian regimes and strengthening our energy resilience.@@@We will ensure that we cannot be coerced or harmed by the reckless actions of rogue actors abroad.@@@We will transition to a future based on renewable and nuclear energy, while ensuring that the gas used during that transition is from reliable sources, including our own North Sea production.@@@We will be a net energy exporter by 2040.@@@Thirdly, we are safeguarding the security of our economy — the supply chains, the critical minerals, the food and the technology that drive growth and protect people’s lives and health.@@@We will not be strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponize the global economy.@@@Instead, we are reforming our economy to get Britain moving, and we want to work with our allies so that we can all move forward together.@@@The free world needs that economic strength and resilience to push back against authoritarian aggression and win this new era of strategic competition.@@@We must do that together.@@@We are therefore building new partnerships around the world.@@@We are fortifying our deep security alliances
in Europe and beyond through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force.@@@We are deepening our links with fellow democracies such as India, Israel, Indonesia and South Africa.@@@We are building new security ties with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region and the Gulf.@@@We have shown leadership on free and fair trade, striking trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and many others.@@@We are also in the process of acceding to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.@@@Rather than exerting influence through debt, aggression and control of critical infrastructure and minerals, we are building strategic ties based on mutual benefit and trust, and we are deepening partnerships such as the Group of Seven and the Commonwealth.@@@We must also collectively extend a hand of friendship to the parts of the world that have too often been left behind and left vulnerable to global challenges, whether that is the Pacific or Caribbean island States dealing with the impact of climate change, or the countries of the Western Balkans facing persistent threats to their stability.@@@The United Kingdom is providing funding, using the might of the City of London and our security capabilities to provide better alternatives to those offered by malign regimes.@@@The resolute international response to Ukraine has shown how we can deliver decisive collective action.@@@The response has been built on partnerships and alliances, as well as on being prepared to use new instruments, including unprecedented sanctions, diplomatic action and rapid military support.@@@There has been a strength of collective purpose.@@@We have met many times, spoken many times on the phone and made things happen.@@@Now we must use those instruments in a more systematic way to push back on the economic aggression of authoritarian regimes.@@@The G-7 and our like-minded partners should act as an economic NATO, collectively defending our prosperity.@@@If the economy of a partner is being targeted by an aggressive regime, we should act to support that partner — all for one and one for all.@@@Through the G-7’s $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we provide an honest and reliable alternative for infrastructure investment around the world, free from debt with strings attached.@@@We must go further to friend-shore our supply chains and end strategic dependence.@@@That is how we will build collective security, strengthen our resilience and safeguard freedom and democracy.@@@Nevertheless, we cannot let up on dealing with the crisis we face today.@@@No one is threatening Russia.@@@Yet, as we meet here today, barbarous weapons are being used to kill and maim people in Ukraine.@@@Rape is being used as an instrument of war.@@@Families are being torn apart.@@@Earlier today, we saw Putin desperately try to justify his catastrophic failures.@@@He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate.@@@He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms.@@@He is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats.@@@That will not work.@@@The international alliance is strong, and Ukraine is strong.@@@The contrast between Russia’s conduct and Ukraine’s brave, dignified First Lady, Olena Zelenska, who is here at the United Nations today, could not be more stark.@@@Ukrainians are not just defending their own country, they are defending our values and the security of the whole world.@@@That is why we must act.@@@That is why the United Kingdom will spend 3 per cent of GDP on defence by 2030, thereby maintaining our position as the leading security actor in Europe.@@@That is why at this crucial moment in the conflict, I pledge that we will sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it takes.@@@New weapons from the United Kingdom are arriving in Ukraine as I speak, including more multiple launch rocket system rockets.@@@We will not rest until Ukraine prevails.@@@In all of those areas, on all of those fronts, the time to act is now.@@@This is a decisive moment in our history — in the history of the Organization and in the history of freedom.@@@The story of 2022 could have been that of an authoritarian State rolling its tanks over the border of a peaceful neighbour and subjugating its people.@@@Instead, it is the story of freedom fighting back.@@@In the face of rising aggression, we have shown that we have the power to act and the resolve to see it through.@@@However, that must not be a one-off.@@@It must be a new era in which we commit to ourselves, our citizens and this institution that we will do whatever it takes — whatever it takes — to deliver for our people and defend our values.@@@As we mourn our late Queen and remember her call to the Assembly, we must devote ourselves to that task.@@@Britain’s commitment to that is total.@@@We will be a dynamic, reliable and trustworthy partner.@@@Together with our friends and allies around the world, we will continue to champion freedom, sovereign and
democracy.@@@Together, we can define this new era as one of hope and progress.
